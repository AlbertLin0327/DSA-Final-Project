Gay Head Light is an historic Martha's Vineyard lighthouse located on the island's western-most point off of Lighthouse Road in Aquinnah, Massachusetts. Martha's Vineyard has five lighthouses. No other location in the United States has such a high concentration of lighthouses within a small geographical area. The Gay Head Light was the first lighthouse constructed on Martha's Vineyard. This lighthouse was authorized in 1798 by the United States Congress during the Presidency of John Quincy Adams. Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, secured $5,750 from Congress to build the lighthouse in 1798.[4] This authorization was to help facilitate safe passage for shipping traffic through the hazardous Vineyard Sound between the Gay Head clay cliffs and the Elizabeth Islands. In the area westerly of the clay cliffs is the infamous Devil's Bridge, which is composed of a submerged shoal and rock formation. In 1799 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts deeded two acres and four rods to the Federal Government for the purpose of building a lighthouse overlooking the clay cliffs and Devil's Bridge. During the same year, President John Adams approved a contract with Martin Lincoln of Hingham, Massachusetts, to build a 47-foot octagonal wooden lighthouse tower; a 17 x 26-foot keeper's house, and various outbuildings. Ebenezer Skiff was appointed by Congress as the first Gay Head Lighthouse Keeper. Skiff was also the first European to live in the town of Gay Head, which was populated by members of the Wampanoag Tribe. On 18 November 1799, Ebenezer Skiff ignited the spider lamp inside the tower's lighting room, officially illuminating the light for the first time as an aide to navigation. The light was projected from lamp wicks fueled by sperm whale oil.[5]Skiff's original salary as Principal Keeper was $200 per year. During the early 1800s, a 10 parabolic lens was installed. In 1838 the lantern was lowered 14 feet (4m) to get the light under the fog, and again the same year by 3 feet (1m) during a major rebuilding of the lantern and deck. In 1844, the octagonal wooden light tower was moved back 75 feet from the eroding clay cliffs by John Mayhew of Edgartown at a cost of $386.87.[5] By the early 1850s the tower was in disrepair and again threatened by the eroding clay cliffs. In 1852, the Federal Lighthouse Board issued a 760-page report stating that Gay Head Lighthouse was not second to any on the eastern coast, and should be fitted, without delay, with a first-order illuminating apparatus. In 1854, Congress approved $30,000 for the construction of a new brick tower to fit a first-order Fresnel lens, and a new keeper's residence. As a result, the existing 51 feet tall conical brick tower was started in 1854 and lit in 1856.[1] The bricks used to construct the light were composed of clay harvested from the nearby cliffs. It was equipped with a whale oil fired first-order Fresnel lens standing about 12 feet (4m) tall; weighing several tons (tonnes); and containing 1,009 hand-made crystal prisms. Shortly before installation above the Gay Head Light in 1856, the Fresnel Lens won a Gold Medal at the World's Fair in Paris.[6] At the time of installation, Gay Head was listed as one of the most important lighthouse locations in the United States. Therefore, it deservedly became one of the first lighthouses in the United States to receive a first-order Fresnel lens.[1] Prior to being shipped overseas from France, the Fresnel lens installed at Gay Head was exhibited at the World's Fair in Paris. After installation, the Gay Head Light received considerable publicity. This resulted in many tourists visiting the light via steamship and other transport systems of the period. In 1874 the Gay Head Light was changed from flashing white to "three whites and one red" to differentiate the light from other lights along the East Coast. The Gay Head Light was converted from whale oil to kerosene oil operation in 1885.[7] Gay Head was one of the last towns in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to receive electricity in the early 1950s. Shortly after the town received electricity, the Fresnel lens was replaced in 1952 by a high-intensity electrified Carlisle & Finch DCB-224 aero beacon, that was custom-made as a double-tiered cannon beacon to maintain the historic signal of "three whites and one red". When the original Fresnel lens was dismantled in 1952, it was transferred to Edgartown and mounted on top of a one-story brick structure with a glass lantern house enclosure at the Martha's Vineyard Museum in Edgartown, Massachusetts.[8] Charles W. Vanderhoop, who served as the light's Principal Keeper from 1920 to 1933, had the honor of lighting the Fresnel lens at its new location during a dedication ceremony. In 1988, the high-intensity electrified beacon Carlisle & Finch DCB-224 aero beacon was replaced with a single-tiered double cannon high-intensity DCB-224 beacon. With the 1988 installation of the DCB-224 lens, the Gay Head Light's distinctively historic signal of "three whites and one red" was changed to "one white and one red." The double-tiered Carlisle & Finch DCB-224 aero beacon was transferred by the United States Coast Guard to Vineyard Environmental Research, Institute, whose board member, Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Jr., presented the light on a loan basis for public display at the Martha's Vineyard Museum. After the Gay Head Light was electrified and automated in the 1950s - the lighthouse's Principal Keeper, Joseph Hindley, vacated the premises. Subsequently, all structures, except the lighthouse, were razed, and the lighthouse was closed to public access. From 1956 to 1985, the automated Gay Head Light was sparingly maintained by the United States Coast Guard. Due to US Coast Guard Congressional funding shortages through the 1970s and early 1980s, various lighthouses around the United States were designated for destruction because the structures were expensive to maintain, and no longer served as vital aids to navigation. This obsolete designation was precipitated by enhanced satellite GPS and other electrical maritime navigation aids. In the mid-1980s, due to United States Coast Guard funding shortages, the Gay head Light along with two other Martha's Vineyard lighthouses (East Chop Light and Edgartown Harbor Light) were listed for destruction. Documentation of lighthouses destroyed in recent history is available from Lighthouse Digest, which maintains a "Doomsday List" of threatened lighthouses.[9] The three threatened lights on Martha's Vineyard were saved through the objecting federal petition and Congressional testimony of Vineyard Environmental Research, Institute's (VERI) founding President, William Waterway Marks, and VERI Chairperson, John F. Bitzer, Jr.[10] VERI received the support of Senator Ted Kennedy[11] and Congressman Gerry Studds during and after the Congressional hearings. Following the Congressional hearings, the United States Coast Guard licensed the three lights to VERI in 1985 for thirty-five years.[10] This was the first time in U.S. History that control of "active" lighthouses was transferred to a civilian organization. On similar note, this was the first time in the history of Martha's Vineyard that control of any of its five lighthouses was now in the hands of an island organization. After receiving the lighthouse license, the Institute undertook a series of fundraising activities that engaged the community of Martha's Vineyard, including local supporters and celebrities such as board members: Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Jr.;[12] Jonathan Mayhew, whose ancestor's were the Vineyard's first European settlers; Vineyard Gazette co-owner, Jody Reston; philanthropist, Flipper Harris; Margaret K. Littlefield; the actress, Linda Kelsey; WHOI Director, Derek W. Spencer,[13] and John F. Bitzer, Jr.. Speakers and performers appearing at these lighthouse events were renowned historian, David McCullough; Senator Ted Kennedy; Caroline Kennedy; Edward M. Kennedy, Jr.; Congressman Gerry Studds; singer/songwriter, Carly Simon; Kate Taylor; Livingston Taylor; Hugh Taylor; Dennis Miller from Saturday Night Live; Bill Styron's wife, Rose Styron - who read one of her original lighthouse poems; United States Navy Rear Admiral, Richard A. Bauman;[14] famed photographer, Alfred Eisenstaedt,[15] and comedian, Steve Sweeney.[10] The proceeds from the lighthouse benefits were applied to a major restoration of the Gay Head Light, which included: emergency pointing of brick walls; removal of toxic mold growing all over the brick interior walls; installing new windows on the ground floor and two landing levels; replacing broken plate glass and sealing roof leaks in the lighting room; restoration of hardwood staircase rail; sandblasting, sealing, and painting of the historic rusted cast-iron spiral staircase and its three story internal metal flooring and support structure. From the earliest days of its history, the Gay Head Light appears as though it welcomed visiting public. Early photographs depict visitors populating the lighthouse balcony and its surrounding grounds. In 1856, after the installation of the famous Fresnel lens, tourism to the lighthouse and its surrounding grounds increased. Special steamship excursions from the Oak Bluffs Wharf took tourists to a dock below the Gay Head Cliffs, where waiting oxcarts provided transport to the lighthouse. Circa 1857, Harper's Magazine published an account of a visit to the lighthouse and its powerful new lens by writer David Hunter Strother: "At night we mounted the tower and visited the look-out gallery that belts the lighthouse at some distance below the lantern. Here we were surprised by a unique and splendid spectacle. The whole dome of heaven, from the centre to the horizon, was flecked with bars of misty light, revolving majestically on the axis of the tower. These luminous bars, although clearly defined, were transparent; and we could distinctly see the clouds and stars behind them. Of all the heavenly phenomena that I have had the good fortune to witness  borealis lights, mock suns, or meteoric showers  I have never seen anything that in mystic splendor equaled this trick of the magic lantern at Gay Head." Public access was also documented by historian Edward Rowe Snow, who mentioned how Principal Keeper, Charles W. Vanderhoop, and his assistant, Max Attaquin, "...probably took one-third of a million visitors to the top of Gay Head Light between 1910 and 1933." After electrification and automation circa 1956 - the Gay Head Light was closed to public access. In 1987 on Mother's Day, VERI reopened the Gay Head Light to the public for the first time since 1956. At the same time, the lighthouse was also made available for weddings and special functions. In 1986, when William Waterway Marks became the light's Principal Keeper; he appointed his friend, Charles Vanderhoop, Jr., as Assistant Keeper, along with abutting lighthouse property owner, Helen Manning. Charles Vanderhoop, Jr. was born in the lighthouse while his father, Charles W. Vanderhoop, was serving as Principal Keeper from 1920-1933.[10] In 1929, Charles W. Vanderhoop gave a lighthouse tour to President Calvin Coolidge just after his presidency ended.[16] Charles W. Vanderhoop was the only Wampanoag to serve in the position of Keeper until his son, Charles Vanderhoop, Jr., was appointed Assistant Keeper in 1986. During the late 1980s, various other people from the community also served as modern-day Gay Head Light assistant keepers on weekends and on special occasions. In 1990, William Waterway Marks appointed Richard Skidmore and his wife, Joan LeLacheur, as Assistant Keepers. Richard and Joan became Principal Keepers in 1994 and remain in that position today. In 1987 VERI also opened the East Chop and Edgartown lights to the public for the first time in many decades.[10] After the Gay Head Light opened to the public, bus loads of children from all of the island's schools began to visit the light as part of their educational programs.[10] In 1994, VERI transferred their lighthouse license to the Martha's Vineyard Historical Society (MVHS), which is now known as the Martha's Vineyard Museum. At the time, William Waterway Marks was also serving as a MVHS board member, and was installed as the first Chairman of the newly formed MVHS Lighthouse Committee, where he served for four years from 1994 to 1997.[10] Today the Gay Head Light is managed by the Martha's Vineyard Museum and is open to the public during the summer season, on special holidays, and for weddings and other private functions. In August, 2009, Principal Keeper, Joan LeLacheur, gave President Barack Obama and his family a private tour during their vacation on Martha's Vineyard.[8] This lighthouse also appears briefly in the background of the movie Jaws as Chief Brody is driving to the beach.[17] Through dedicated work and sacrifice of the Martha's Vineyard Community, the Gay Head Light survives today as an iconic symbol of the island's maritime history. On June 15, 1987 - the Gay Head Light was placed on the National Register of Historic Places as Gay Head Light, reference number 87001464.,[3] while under the management of VERI through its United States Coast Guard License Number DTCGZ71101-85-RP-007L.
