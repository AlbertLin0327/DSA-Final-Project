This is a list of the universities in Germany, of which there are about seventy. The list also includes the 13 German "universities of technology" which have official and full university status, but which usually focus on education in the natural sciences rather than covering the whole spectrum of academic disciplines. However, the list does not cover the German Fachhochschulen (universities of applied sciences) and institutions that cover only certain disciplines such as business studies, fine arts, or engineering sciences. Those do not have all of the responsibilities and limitations of old universities and they can not award Doctorate Degrees on their own. This is a list of the ten oldest universities that have been in continuous operation since their founding in present-day Germany. Some other formerly German universities, for instance the Charles University in Prague (now in the Czech Republic) are no longer on German soil. Also, some universities were established in the 14th or 15th centuries, but shut down for longer periods and later re-opened (e.g. the universities of Cologne, Erfurt, Ingolstadt or Wrzburg). These are not included in this list.[1] According to the THEQS World University Rankings: NR = no ranking or ranking outside top 200.
