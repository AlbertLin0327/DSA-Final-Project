Bajo el signo de cain (Under Cain's Sign) is the twelfth album overall from Latin music singer-songwriter Miguel Bos. Released in 1993, it was his fifth full-length on WEA Latina. As the lyrics are rather stream of consciousness, Bose wrote a sentence or two as a dedication for certain people at the end of each song. No podre salir de este rincon mas que a traves de la espada y mirandote a los ojos. (To you who have yet to enter this world...you will not be able to leave but for the sword staring you in the eyes.)
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
