The silver-stripe round herring or slender sprat, Spratelloides gracilis, is a small herring-like forage fish.[1] They are small fish used as fishing bait, especially in skipjack tuna-fishing. It is valued as food in Japan, where it is known as kibinago. These can be eaten raw, as Sashimi, or cooked, as whitebait.[2] Sashimi of kibinago (silver-stripe round herring) Kibinago sashimi with chopsticks Grilled kibinago
