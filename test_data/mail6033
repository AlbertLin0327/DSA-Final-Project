The Choctaw meridian begins on the Choctaw baseline, latitude 31 54' 40" north, longitude 90 14' 45" west from Greenwich, runs north to the south boundary of the Chickasaw cession, in latitude 34 19' 40" north, and governs the surveys east and west of the meridian, and north of the base line. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
