Content:
County routes in Steuben County, New York, are maintained by the Steuben County highway department and signed with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices-standard yellow-on-blue pentagon shield. No county routes enter the cities of Corning or Hornell, and only two enter a village. Most primary through roads in Steuben County are either county routes or New York state highways.
