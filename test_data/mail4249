Camilla is a city in Mitchell County, Georgia, United States, and is its county seat[3]. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 5,360[4]. The city was incorporated in 1858. The name Camilla was chosen in honor of the granddaughter of Henry Mitchell, an American Revolutionary War general for whom Mitchell County was named.[5] On September 19, 1868, Republican Party marchers convening for a meeting during the Reconstruction era were fired upon by whites. As they returned to Albany, they were continually attacked. Harper's Weekly estimated that between 50 and 75 African-Americans were killed and wounded, and the Republican candidate for Congress, Colonel Pierce, was seriously injured.[6][7] This event is thought to have lowered black turnout during the following election, and was likely instrumental in the enactment of the 1870 ban on firearms and knives at public gatherings.[8] A version of this law was just repealed with the passage of Senate Bill 308 through the hard work of www.GeorgiaCarry.Org. The law was on the books for over 140 year. In the early 2000s, the city was hit by two disastrous sets of tornadoes, both occurring in the dark hours of the early morning and both going through roughly the same area. The first outbreak was on February 14, 2000;[9] the second outbreak was on March 20, 2003.[10] Camilla is located at 311349N 841233W / 31.23028N 84.20917W / 31.23028; -84.20917 (31.230243, -84.209102)[11].
