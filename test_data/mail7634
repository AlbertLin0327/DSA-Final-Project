Dalmiro Finol [dahl-mee'-roh fe-nohl'] (August 21, 1919 -?, 1994) was a professional baseball player. A native of Zulia State, Venezuela, he batted and threw right-handed. A versatile utility man, Finol was able to play all positions except pitcher and catcher, playing mainly at right field or first base. Basically a line-drive hitter and a fine defensive player, he started his career in the Venezuelan League in 1946 with the Caracas BBC, playing for them in nine of his 11 professional seasons. He also played in part of two seasons with Gavilanes (195354) and Magallanes (195556). Although he never played in American baseball, Finol teamed with major league figures as Willard Brown, Alex Carrasquel, Chico Carrasquel, Wilmer Fields, Jim Pendleton and Len Yochim, among others. As a rookie, he led the league with seven home runs, becoming the first player to win the league's title, and later led the league with 35 RBI in the 1947-48 season. His most productive effort came in the 1953-54 tournament, when he posted career-highs in home runs (10), RBI (47) and games played (70). He also had two good seasons, hitting .320 in 1948-49 and .365 in 1951-52. In a 11-season career, Finol was a .275 hitter (468-for-1703) with 47 home runs and 293 RBI in 471 games, including 241 runs, 73 doubles, three triples, and 35 stolen bases. Finol died in his homeland of Zulia at age of 75.
