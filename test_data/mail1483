Hotel Splendide is a 1932 British comedy drama film directed by Michael Powell. It was made as a Quota quickie. Jerry Mason inherits the Hotel Splendide at Speymouth but is disappointed when he sees it is a quiet place with a few permanent residents. Gentleman Charlie, a jewel thief arrives after a long spell in prison expecting to be able to dig up the pearls he had buried - only to find the hotel has been built on the site. Made for 4,000 for Gaumont-British. The film features one of the earliest cinematic uses of Gounod's "Funeral March of the Marionettes", better known as the theme music for Alfred Hitchcock Presents.
