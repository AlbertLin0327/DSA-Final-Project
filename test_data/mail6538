Bucheon FC 1995 is a South Korean football club located in the city of Bucheon, which is currently a member of the Challengers League. The club was founded by a group of former Bucheon SK supporters after the relocation of Bucheon SK to Seogwipo at the beginning of 2006. Within weeks of the relocation of Bucheon SK, fans of the club began a movement to establish a brand new side in Bucheon, with an initial goal of creating a team to participate in the 2007 Korea National League season. The financial requirements for entry to the National League were so great and that, coupled with the launch of the K3 League in 2007, led to them readjusting their target and focusing on entry to the K3 League in 2008. During the course of 2007 deals with several major sponsors, including Sports Toto, Daum and SK Energy were negotiated. On October 25th, 2007, the club's name, Bucheon FC 1995, was announced, and the club was officially founded on December 1st. as of March 1, 2011 Note: Flags indicate national team as has been defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.
