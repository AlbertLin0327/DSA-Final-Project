Markazi Behsud District (Dari |   ) also spelled as Behsood is a district of Wardak Province, Afghanistan. The district has a Hazara majority resident population. For many years, there has been a flare up in ethnic violence in the district. Local Hazaras accuse Pashtun nomads of destroying their crop fields, burning their homes and killing civilians. Pashtun nomads, locally known as Kuchi enter the area every year in late spring, and allow their animals to graze on crop fields. Local Hazaras claim that Kuchi militias being armed with heavy weapons is supported by the Taliban and elements of the Afghan government. According to some latest reports, several villages have been burned and thousands of local villagers have had to flee the area in May-June 2012. The clashes have reportedly resulted in the death of six local villagers on June 8, 2012. Pashtun nomads have also burned copies of Qoran, the Muslim holy book. President Karzai's spokesman has accused the Taliban of being involved in the attacks against the villagers and their property.
