Fastsigns (trademarked in all-capitals as FASTSIGNS) is the franchisor of Fastsigns centers which provide a full range of custom sign and graphics products to companies and individuals who want to outsource their signage needs.[1][2] There are currently more than 530 Fastsigns retail locations worldwide in United States, Canada, the U.K., Brazil, the Cayman Islands, Mexico and Australia (where centers operate under the name Signwave). Countries where the company formerly had locations but no longer operates include Colombia (from which it withdrew in 1996) and Argentina.[3] Fastsigns was founded in 1985 in Dallas by Gary Salomon and Bob Schanbaum. The first franchise was sold December 1986, and its first international franchise sold in 1991. The company was bought in October 2003 by Roark Capital Group, an Atlanta-based private equity firm.[2][4] In 2009, former president of PIP Printing, Catherine Monson was named CEO of Fastsigns.[5][6] The creation and growth of Fastsigns was profiled in a case study in the textbook Managing: A Competency-Based Approach.[7] Fastsigns' President and CEO, Catherine Monson, was featured in Season 3, Episode 12 of Undercover Boss, first aired on CBS on Friday 4th May 2012. Fastsigns makes custom banners, large format inkjet signs, vehicle graphics, decals, QR codes, mobile websites, architectural site signs, digital signs, point of purchase exhibits and displays. They also provide in-house custom design services and consultation, delivery, and installation.[8] FASTSIGNSs CEO Catherine Monson was featured on the hit reality show Undercover Boss (U.S. TV series) in May 2012, which included visits to several FASTSIGNS franchises across the U.S. Monson stepped into the shoes of employees, working alongside franchise owners to perform site surveys, make signs in a production center, apply vehicle graphics, and install high-rise signs from a crane.
