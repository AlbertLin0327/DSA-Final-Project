The 201112 season was Manchester United's 20th season in the Premier League, and their 37th consecutive season in the top-flight of English football. United were defending Premier League champions, and aimed for an unprecedented 20th league title this season. Furthermore, they were competing in the Champions League for a 16th successive season. In addition, they were competing in the domestic tournaments, the FA Cup and the League Cup. Manchester United began the season with a 32 win over local rivals Manchester City in the Community Shield at Wembley on 7August2011. They were however knocked out of the League Cup at the Fifth Round stage for the second successive season after losing 21 to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford on 30 November 2011. On 7 December 2011, United lost 21 away to Basel, a result which saw them finish third in their Champions League group. This meant that they competed in the UEFA Europa League (formerly the UEFA Cup) for the first time since the 199596 season. However, they only made it as far as the Round of 16, falling to Athletic Bilbao 53 on aggregate. On 4 January 2012 against Newcastle United, Ryan Giggs broke Sir Bobby Charlton's record for the most starts, the match being Giggs' 757th start. On 28 January 2012, United were knocked out of the FA Cup in the Fourth Round after losing 21 against Liverpool at Anfield. Going into the last match of the season, on 13 May 2012, United and Manchester City were locked together on 86 points at the top the table, but City led with an eight-goal advantage in goal difference. United therefore needed to better City's result to win the title. They were on course to do this, winning 10 at Sunderland, whilst City trailed 21 at home to Queens Park Rangers. However, two stoppage time goals from Edin Deko and Sergio Agero gave City a 32 win and edged United out on goal difference. It was the first time in 23 years that the champions and the runners-up had finished level on points. Manchester United preceded their 201112 campaign with a tour of the United States for the second year in a row. As in 2010, they played in the MLS All-Star Game, in which they took on a team of the best players in Major League Soccer. In the lead-up to this game, which was played on 27 July 2011, United took on the New England Revolution (13 July), the Seattle Sounders (20 July) and the Chicago Fire (23 July), before finishing the tour with a game against Barcelona at FedEx Field in Washington, D.C. on 30 July.[1] The club granted a testimonial to Paul Scholes, who retired on 31 May 2011, to honour his 17 years of service to United. The match was played at Old Trafford against New York Cosmos on 5 August 2011.[2][3] United won the game 60  with Scholes himself opening the scoring  to complete an unbeaten pre-season.[4] The club also granted a testimonial to Harry Gregg, a survivor of the 1958 Munich air disaster, who rescued a 20-month-old girl, her pregnant mother and attempted to revive United manager Sir Matt Busby.[5] The match was played at Windsor Park against Irish League XI on 15 May 2012. The Irish XI was managed by Martin O'Neill and David Jeffrey.[6] United won the game 41. As Premier League champions, United began the season against the holders of the FA Cup, local rivals Manchester City. The match was played at Wembley on 7 August.[7] This was the first time the Shield had been contested by the two clubs in 55 years. United had most of the possession and more shots on goal in the first half, but it was City who took the lead in the 38th minute when Joleon Lescott nodded in a David Silva free-kick. Edin Deko then doubled City's lead on the stroke of half-time with a low strike from long-distance. However, seven minutes into the second half, Chris Smalling volleyed home an Ashley Young free-kick to reduce the deficit, and then Nani finished off an intricate passing move involving Wayne Rooney and Tom Cleverley in the 58th minute to bring the score back to 22. With a penalty shoot-out looming as the game moved into injury time, Nani forced a mistake from City captain Vincent Kompany, outpaced the defence and rounded goalkeeper Joe Hart before sliding the ball into the empty net to seal United's comeback and their 19th FA Community Shield.[8] The fixtures for the 201112 season were announced on 17 June, with United beginning the defence of their title away from home for the first time since 200506.[9] United travelled to The Hawthorns to take on West Bromwich Albion on 14 August 2011, and won 21. Wayne Rooney opened the scoring when he fired a left-footed shot past Ben Foster, but United goalkeeper David de Gea made his second error in as many games to allow Shane Long to equalise as the Republic of Ireland striker's low shot crept past him and trickled over the line. However, on 81 minutes, the winner was scored when United winger Ashley Young, being booed by the home fans due to his link with rivals Aston Villa, unleashed a cross-goal shot which deflected off Gabriel Tama and then Steven Reid to give United the win. United's next game was at home to Tottenham Hotspur, United's first game at Old Trafford for exactly 3 months. The game was goal-less at half-time, with both goalkeepers making saves. The best effort of the half, which fell to United's Tom Cleverley, was saved by Spurs 'keeper Brad Friedel. Ashley Young also headed wide from Wayne Rooney's chip. However, 15 minutes into the second half, United opened the scoring with a clinical goal from Danny Welbeck. The young forward latched onto Cleverley's cross before heading past Friedel at the Stretford End. Then, 16 minutes later, it was 20, when a brilliant passing move culminated with Anderson latching onto Welbeck's backheel and ramming past Friedel. Tottenham almost pulled one back when Jermain Defoe volleyed against David de Gea's post following an error from the Spanish goalie, but the points were sealed on 87 minutes, when Rooney thudded home a header from a Ryan Giggs centre. The win took United up to second place, one place behind rivals Manchester City. This also meant that United and City were on level points, with City only leading due to having slightly better goal difference than United. United's next game was against rivals Arsenal at Old Trafford on 28 August. United were in full control for most of the first half, with Danny Welbeck opening the scoring after 22 minutes. However, a couple of minutes later, Jonny Evans was judged to have fouled Theo Walcott in the box and referee Howard Webb gave a penalty. Robin van Persie stepped up to take the penalty but his effort was easily saved by David de Gea. United were to make them pay for their mistake and Ashley Young made it 20 on 28 minutes with a curling effort into the top corner. Wayne Rooney then scored a free-kick on 41 minutes to further their advantage to 30. Theo Walcott managed to nick a goal back, slotting the ball under David de Gea making the half-time score 31 to United. After half-time Wayne Rooney scored another free-kick to extend United's lead to 41 before Nani chipped the keeper from 12 yards to make it 51. Park Ji-Sung came on and hit a left foot drive into the bottom corner to increase United's lead on 70 minutes to 61. Arsenal did get another goal back through Robin van Persie's left foot volley, before Carl Jenkinson fouled substitute Javier Hernndez to earn him a second yellow card and an early bath. United made the extra man advantage count when Patrice Evra was fouled in the box by Theo Walcott and Wayne Rooney slotted home the penalty for his hat-trick. Ashley Young completed the rout when his curling effort found the net in the 90th minute to make the final score 82. The win put United top on goal difference ahead of rivals Manchester City by one goal. United travelled to the Reebok Stadium to face Bolton Wanderers in their next game, knowing that they had slipped down to third after Manchester City and Chelsea had both won earlier in the day. After Tom Cleverley had limped off after taking a kick in the foot by Kevin Davies, United got off to a dream start inside 5 minutes, as Javier Hernndez steered home a Nani cross at the near post for his first goal of the season. Wayne Rooney doubled the champions' lead by prodding home Phil Jones' right-wing cross. Four minutes later, Rooney grabbed his second of the game, tapping home after Jones' cross-cum-shot was blocked by the legs of Jussi Jskelinen. Hernndez swept in his second  and United's fourth  on 58 minutes, before 10 minutes later, Rooney completed his hat-trick  his second successive treble and his seventh hat-trick for United  by drilling home. Late on, Hernndez tried desperately to complete a hat-trick of his own, but his efforts to complete his first hat-trick for United ended in vain. Still, United overtook City on goal difference for the second successive game, with United top of the table by three goals. United's next game was at home to rivals Chelsea on 18 September 2011. United opened the scoring after 8 minutes after Chris Smalling rose unmarked to head an Ashley Young free-kick into the far corner. After Ramires failed to convert a Fernando Torres cross, mishitting the ball and allowing David de Gea to spring across the goal to make the save, Nani doubled United's lead on 37 minutes, firing the ball into the top corner from 30 yards. The first half ended with a 30 lead for United after Phil Jones ran forward into the Chelsea penalty area and, following a block from Nani, the ball rebounded back to Wayne Rooney who sidefooted the ball home. At half time Nicolas Anelka was introduced for Chelsea in favour of Frank Lampard and he immediately assisted Torres, who reduced the deficit to 31 mere seconds into the second half. However, it was United who received the next significant chance when Nani smashed the ball off the crossbar and, when attempting to gather the rebound, he was fouled by Jos Bosingwa in side the penalty area. Rooney went to take the penalty but slipped during the run up to strike the ball, causing the shot to go well wide. Chelsea also had a chance in the last 10 minutes when Torres shimmied the ball past De Gea but sliced his shot at the open goal wide. Manchester United's next game was away to Stoke City on 24 September 2011, a team in which United have beat in all six of the teams' previous meetings in the Premier League. However, the game ended 11, which meant that United relinquished their 100% league record in the 201112 season, and City took points off United in the league for the first time. Early on, United had a penalty shout when Javier Hernndez was brought down by Jonathan Woodgate in the penalty area, but the referee turned down United's shouts and Hernndez eventually limped off. Despite this, United opened the scoring through Nani on 27 minutes, who exchanged passes with Darren Fletcher, before finishing beyond Asmir Begovi with aplomb. David de Gea pulled off a couple of outstanding saves to keep United ahead, but Stoke levelled in the 52nd minute, through Peter Crouch's emphatic header. Ryan Giggs squandered a great late chance as the points were shared. United remained ahead of Manchester City on goal difference. United's next game was a 20 home win against Norwich City on 1 October 2011, United's first game that kicked off on 3pm on a Saturday for almost half a year. Before United's first goal on 68 minutes, one of Norwich's many chances came through former Huddersfield winger, Anthony Pilkington, who could only shoot wide. United's first goal came when Ryan Giggs' corner was headed on by Phil Jones and then Wayne Rooney, and Anderson headed it in. Seven minutes later, Pilkington had another chance, but his deflected shot was tipped onto the post by United goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard, making his Premier League debut, and then saved by the Danish 'keeper. United sealed the win on 87 minutes, when Danny Welbeck scored after exchanging passes with Park Ji-Sung. Wayne Rooney's record of scoring in every Premier League game in the season ended, despite an attempt to chip the ball over Norwich keeper John Ruddy and hitting the crossbar. United, however, kept their place at the top of the Premier League on goal difference. After an international break, United played Liverpool on 15 October, in a game that Sir Alex Ferguson said was better than the El Clsico itself.[10] Although United started as the better side, gradually Liverpool started to come about more chances until first-half whistle. Following tradition that there had yet to be a 00 draw between these two sides, Rio Ferdinand clipped Charlie Adam outside the penalty area, and Steven Gerrard converted from the free kick, giving Liverpool the lead the 60th minute, and also handing him the 'Man of the Match' award after the match (in his first start for Liverpool since 6 March 2011). However Liverpool's enjoyment was short lived, as 10 minutes from time, Javier Hernndez headed into the back of the net, making the score 11. Despite late efforts from both teams, the game eventually finished 11, leaving United 1 point ahead of local rivals Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table for the time being. Manchester City later defeated Aston Villa 41 to go top of the Premier League, 2 points clear of United. The next game was the Manchester derby, at Old Trafford, which saw the Manchester City go out as winners. United started dominating the game, but just the second time City came close to De Gea and Mario Balotelli neatly scored for the visit. United kept control of the game for the remainer of the first half, but couldn't capitalise on their chances. Later, two minutes into the second half, Jonny Evans received a red card for a challenge on Balotelli near the area. City went on to score two more goals, another from Balotelli and one from Sergio Agero. Next, ten minutes from time, United scored via Darren Fletcher, and a few minutes later had a chance from a free kick by Ashley Young but Chris Smalling couldn't direct the ball properly to the net. They would regret not scoring because what followed were three more goals from City, one from David Silva and two from Edin Deko. The final score was 61, handing United their first home defeat since losing to Chelsea in the 200910 campaign, and seeing the Citizens top the table by five points. Their next game was away to Everton. In late years United had had troubles on that stadium, including a 33 draw the previous year in which Everton had scored two stoppage time goals to level the match. The game started and slowly United started building confidence, and finally a goal by Javier Hernndez from a cross by Patrice Evra put United ahead in the score, and the game would end 10. Sunderland visited Old Trafford in their next game. This game saw the return of two ex-Manchester United players to Old Trafford, Wes Brown and John O'Shea. The game was a tough test for the Red Devils, but they were the winners when Brown deflected a cross into his own net at the end of the first 45 minutes. His return to Old Trafford saw him scoring for the club he had previously played (and scored) for. They were away to Welsh side Swansea City, in their next league game. For the first time, United visited Swans new home, Liberty Stadium. United dominated for the first 15 minutes and, at 11 minutes, Hernndez scored from a pass from the left by Ryan Giggs. The home side had a good chance a few minutes later after a cross from the right saw the striker in front of an open goal, but wasn't able to shoot and Jonny Evans prevented him from doing it. For the rest of the first half it was an end to end affair, but with no real danger from any of the two. The second half started and Swansea got off as the better side. For 35 minutes they dominated the game and had a couple of good opportunities to score, but United were defending slidly. For the last ten minutes United got back to their feet and had very good chances of scoring. Wayne Rooney shot from outside the box a few times but he wasn't successful. Antonio Valencia also had a shot from outside the box going just out. Phil Jones had a forward run which almost ended in goal, but his shot hit the far post. The game ended 01 for United, their third consecutive win by this score. United received Newcastle United at Old Trafford for the next match. The first half was a pretty much uneventful period and the score by the end of the first 45 minutes was 00. Second half started and in the 48th minute United received a free kick near the area. Rooney blasted his shot but it hit the wall, and when he received the ball back he blasted once again. The ball deflected on a defender and hit Hernndez which richoted into the back of the net. They were one up until Rio Ferdinand tackled Hatem Ben Arfa inside the penalty area, but replays of the tackle showed that he had made contact with the ball first. The referee gave Newcastle the penalty anyway and Demba Ba scored to level the game 11. United kept pushing and trying to score but couldn't. For the last five minutes they received several corners, but no attempt ended in the net, save a last one by Hernndez but was ruled offside. The score ended 11. Their next game was a visit to Villa Park against Aston Villa. The first few minutes of the game were divided. Five minutes after the start Hernndez was injured on his left ankle and was substituted by Antonio Valencia. Finally United scored at the 20th minute. A cross from the left from Nani was finished by Phil Jones, making it his first Manchester United goal. United kept pushing for the rest of the game, and despite Aston Villa's improvement in the second half, they kept a clean sheet. At the end of the second half United kept pushing, and even had a goal ruled offside from Welbeck. They couldn't score the second. The score finally read 01. Next they received Wolves at Old Trafford. United got to the better start and it went on for the rest of the game. In the 17th minute, after a run from the left, Nani profiled himself through the center and fired a shot that ended at the back of the net. Ten minutes later Wayne Rooney fired from the same angle Nani had fired minutes before and this time as well ended in goal. This ended an eight-match draught without any goals for Rooney, and it was the first time since defeating Norwich City 20 that United scored more than once in a game. United kept their dominance for the remainder of the first half. The second half started with Wolverhampton capitalising on the first chance they got, with a header from Steven Fletcher ending in the back of David De Gea's net. In spite of this United kept their dominance and scored once more in the 56th minute when a cross from Antonio Valencia was received by Nani, making it 31. Then, in the 62nd minute Wayne Rooney scored once again acrobatically, making it 41, which was the final score. Two days after they defeated Wolves, at Stamford Bridge, host Chelsea defeated their rival, City, their first defeat in the 201112 Premier League and narrowed the points gap into two points differences. Next they visited the Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. Wayne Rooney scored one of United's quickest goal this season, heading in Valencia's cross. Michael Carrick scored his first goal since January 2010, a solo dribble and finish to seal the scoresheet 20. On 21 December 2011, United played a game at Craven Cottage away to Fulham. The game finished 50 with goals from Danny Welbeck, Nani, Ryan Giggs (whose goal meant he had scored in all 20 Premier League seasons) then in the second half; two late goals from Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov in the 88th and 90th minute finished the match off. United's next game was at home to Wigan Athletic. The game was played on 26 December (Boxing Day) 2011, and United won 50. Park Ji-Sung coolly slotted the hosts into an early lead, before Wigan striker Conor Sammon was harshly sent off for catching Michael Carrick in the face. Dimitar Berbatov fired United 20 ahead, and netted the third after the break with a neat turn and powerful finish. Antonio Valencia rifled into the corner, before Berbatov scored from the spot to complete his hat-trick. United hosted Blackburn Rovers (who entered the match bottom of the table) in their next game. The game was played on 31 December (New Year's Eve) 2011. The match was also played on United manager Sir Alex Ferguson's 70th birthday, but United lost 32 to make it an unhappy birthday for Ferguson. Yakubu gave Rovers the lead from the spot after Dimitar Berbatov had pulled down defender Christopher Samba. The Nigerian made it 20 when he made the most of slack defending to thrash in, before Berbatov brought United back into the match with a header and shot. But Grant Hanley spoilt the day for Ferguson when he nodded in the winner. Late on, Will Keane was brought on for his debut as United searched for an equaliser. However, Keane denied his side an equaliser by blocking a shot from Phil Jones, playing against his former club, on the goal-line. United travelled to St James' Park to face Newcastle United in their next game. The game was United's first of 2012, being played on 4 January, but United lost 30 to start the new year in the worst possible fashion, and condemn themselves to a second successive defeat. The Red Devils went behind before the break when striker Demba Ba hooked in his 15th goal of the season. Yohan Cabaye doubled Newcastle's lead with a 30-yard free-kick that crashed in off the crossbar, before Phil Jones headed into his own net late on. Wayne Rooney had a shot blocked on the line and Dimitar Berbatov's deflected header hit the post for the champions. United hosted Bolton Wanderers in their next game, played on 14 January 2012. The match was played six days after a shock 32 win over Manchester City in the FA Cup, and United won 30 to record a second successive win and their first league victory of 2012. United carved out a number of first-half chances, with dm Bogdn saving Wayne Rooney's penalty. But Paul Scholes, 37, who had recently came out of retirement, struck before half-time when he tucked in Rooney's cross. United were careless at times, but Danny Welbeck poked in, before Michael Carrick settled nerves from 20 yards. United travelled to The Emirates to face Arsenal in their next game. The game was played on 22 January 2012, and United won 21 to complete the double over the Gunners, having famously beat them 82 back in August. After a quiet opening, Ryan Giggs picked out Antonio Valencia to head United in front at the far post. Arsenal improved after the break, and although Robin van Persie missed a clear chance, he made amends by finding the bottom corner from 15 yards out. But United won it as Valencia ghosted through and Danny Welbeck lashed home. United hosted Stoke City in their next game, played on 31 January 2012. Stoke hadn't won at Old Trafford for 30 years, and didn't do so on this day, as United won 20, with Javier Hernndez and Dimitar Berbatov netting penalties either side of half-time. United were without 11 players, including Wayne Rooney, and gave a Premier League debut to third-choice keeper Ben Amos. But Hernndez broke the deadlock after Jermaine Pennant fouled Park Ji-Sung, before Berbatov doubled the lead. A foul by Jonathan Walters on Antonio Valencia was punished by the striker. United travelled to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea in their next game. The game was played on 5 February 2012, and United staged a stunning comeback from 30 down to draw 33. Sir Alex Ferguson's champions are without a Premier League win at Chelsea in a decade, and they looked condemned to another defeat as Chelsea took total control early in the second half. Jonny Evans's own goal gave Chelsea a half-time lead against the run of play, before a stunning volley from Juan Mata 24 seconds after the restart and David Luiz's deflected header appeared to give Chelsea an unassailable advantage. United's hopes were then revived by two penalties awarded by referee Howard Webb  both converted by Wayne Rooney  before substitute Javier Hernndez's header six minutes from time gave them a point that was greeted in the manner of a victory by their travelling support. Even then, United were indebted to much-maligned goalkeeper David de Gea for a magnificent save from Mata in the dying moments, and another less spectacular  but equally important  fingertip stop from Chelsea debutant Gary Cahill. United hosted rivals Liverpool in their next game. The match was played on 11 February 2012, and United won 21. The match itself, however, was overshadowed by Liverpool striker Luis Surez refusing to shake hands with United left-back and captain Patrice Evra pre-match. There was also a bust-up in the tunnel at half-time. At the interval, the score was 00. United had the best chance of the half, with Paul Scholes' header from a Ryan Giggs cross going straight at Pepe Reina. At the end of the first half, Surez felt he had been fouled by Rio Ferdinand, but the referee turned down the Uruguay striker's appeals. United opened the scoring in the 47th minute, when Wayne Rooney volleyed home from a Giggs corner, which had been flicked on by Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson. Three minutes later, Rooney scored his second, coolly slotting home Antonio Valencia's pass after Jay Spearing had lost possession. Rooney should have had his hat-trick thanks to a clever step over from Scholes, but he was caught on his heels, and scuffed a tame finish wide. With just over ten minutes to go, Surez gave Liverpool hope, when he poked home from close-range after Charlie Adam's long-range free kick deflected off Rio Ferdinand. However, that goal proved to be nothing but a consolation, as United (temporarily) moved back to the top of the table. United travelled to Carrow Road to face Norwich City in their next game. The game was played on 26 February 2012, and United won 21, despite being unconvincing. United took an early lead when Paul Scholes headed home Nani's cross. Grant Holt levelled for the Canaries late on when he held off Rio Ferdinand to turn and fire into the top corner. But there was still time for Ryan Giggs (making his 900th appearance for United) to steal the points when he converted Ashley Young's cross at the far post. United hosted West Bromwich Albion in their next game. The game was played on 11 March 2012, and United comfortably won 20. Wayne Rooney gave United a 10 lead at the break, diverting Javier Hernndez's shot past Ben Foster on the volley. The United striker then made it 20 from the penalty spot, while West Brom's Jonas Olsson was earlier sent off for a second bookable offence. United deserved their win, and should have scored another goal in the second half when Danny Welbeck slid wide of an open goal after rounding Foster. However, West Brom had two chances of their own  both falling to Keith Andrews  and were unlucky not to have been awarded a penalty when Peter Odemwingie was tripped by Patrice Evra. Away to Wolverhampton Wanderers was United's next game. The previous season United had suffered a 21 defeat at the Molineux Stadium, ending their unbeaten run of 24 games that season. United started playing better and got ahead on the score on the 21st minute when Rooney's corner was received by Michael Carrick, who passed it to Jonny Evans, who smashed it into the back of the net, scoring his first goal for United in his career. On the 43rd minute, a run from Antonio Valencia on the right saw him advance directly into the box, and he shoot from a 30 degrees angle, making it 02. Three minutes later, on stoppage time, Valencia advanced into the backline before passing towards the middle to Danny Welbeck, who scored his seventh league goal. On the second half, on the 56th minute, Valencia made a short pass from a corner to Rafael, who then crossed it to the heart of the box where Hernandez headed the ball into the back of the net. Five minutes later, on the 61st minute, a one two played by Valencia and Welbeck saw Valencia enter the box, and he easily crossed it to the other end where Hernandez was there to score his second of the evening. United could have scored more times. United next played on a Monday at Old Trafford against Fulham, who they had beaten 50 at Craven Cottage. Manchester City had only managed a draw against Stoke City, with Peter Crouch scoring a cracker from outside the 18 yard box, so that meant that if United won their game they would be top of the league by three whole points. United went into the game with this in mind, and while it was a tough test to break Fulham's defense, on the 42nd minute a cross from the left by Ashley Young found defender Jonny Evans on the verge of the box, who passed to the middle and found Wayne Rooney, who slotted in what would prove to be the winner and what placed United top of the league with a three point advantage. United's next game was away at Blackburn Rovers who had beaten United at Old Trafford earlier in the season. Manchester City's draw at home to Sunderland two days earlier, meant United went into this game 2 points ahead of their near rivals. Blackburn held out defensively throughout the first half and almost took the lead as two saves in a minute from David de Gea kept the score at 00. In the second half, United pressed but couldn't break the resilient Blackburn defence down until ten minutes from time when Valencia hit a cross-shot into the far side of the goal to give United the lead. A second goal followed four minutes later from Ashley Young giving United a five-point lead at the top of the table with seven games remaining. United played host to Queens Park Rangers in their next fixture and ran out comfortable 20 winners. The first goal came after a challenge on Ashley Young in the penalty area by midfielder Shaun Derry who was subsequently sent off and United were awarded a penalty. Wayne Rooney dispatched the spot kick past Paddy Kenny to give United the advantage. Paul Scholes then made the game safe in the second half with a 25 yard drive low into the bottom left hand corner. This increased United's lead to 8 points following Manchester City's 1-0 loss to Arsenal that same day. Three days later, they face relegation threatened Wigan Athletic who were in second from bottom in the table in the DW Stadium. Wigan who were promoted to the Premier League since the 2005-06 season have lost all 13 matches they had with United. But however Wigan shocked the Manchester United team and their fans with Shaun Maloney scoring the only goal in that match from a controverisal corner decision past David de Gea. It was United's first ever Premier League defeat to Wigan Athletic, and the first in six games that United concede a goal. This cut United's lead to 5 points following Man City's 40 win over West Bromwich Albion. Then they host Aston Villa four days later, hoping to make a swift response following a shock 1-0 loss to Wigan. Once again, Ashley Young was involved in a controversial penalty, their 3rd straight penalty happening at Old Trafford when his leg appeared to be tackled by Villa's Ciaran Clark just seven minutes into the match. Wayne Rooney scored the opening goal from the spot. The visitors had chances to equalise but to no avail. Villa goalkeeper Shay Given also made good saves to keep the score intact. Ultimately just before half time, Danny Welbeck slotted home to double United's lead. Although Villa's performance in the 2nd half was better, Manchester United still scored further goals from Rooney and the returning Nani secured a comfortable victory for United. The score ended 40. United's next match, which was played at Old Trafford, saw them surrender a two goal, due to two late goals, to draw 44 with Everton. Pld = Matches played; W = Matches won; D = Matches drawn; L = Matches lost; GF = Goals for; GA = Goals against; GD = Goal difference; Pts = Points United entered the FA Cup at the Third Round stage with the other Premier League clubs, as well as those from the Championship. The Third Round draw was made on 4 December 2011,[11] and gave United an away match against holders Manchester City. The tie was played on 8 January 2012, and was the 162nd Manchester derby ending in a 32 win for United. The match saw the dramatic return of Manchester United legend Paul Scholes from his retirement after last season's Champions League Final against Barcelona. Two goals from Wayne Rooney and one from Danny Welbeck saw United go 30 into the second half after Vincent Kompany was sent off after 12 minutes of first half play. However ten men Manchester City bounced back immediately after the break with a free kick from Aleksandar Kolarov followed by a close range goal from Sergio Agero. The draw for the Fourth Round took place on 8 January 2012, and gave United a tie against their other strong rivals Liverpool for the second successive season in the FA Cup. The match was played at Anfield on 28 January 2012. United lost 21. Daniel Agger's header put Liverpool in front, and Park Ji-Sung equalised seven minutes before the break, but Dirk Kuyt's late winner ended United's hopes of winning the famous trophy. United had hit the post through Antonio Valencia in the first half. This loss meant that United still had not won the FA Cup since 2004, or even appeared in a final since 2007. As one of eight English clubs who qualified for European competition in the 201011 season, United received a bye to the Third Round of the League Cup. The draw took place on 27 August 2011, giving United a trip to Elland Road to take on fierce rivals Leeds United.[12] The match took place on 20 September 2011, where United won 30. Sir Alex Ferguson handed a start to debutant Ezekiel Fryers, 18 years old, and twice early on, Dimitar Berbatov had to clear off the line. But that was the closest the hosts came to causing an upset, as Michael Owen opened the scroring on 15 minutes with a scuffed shot and lashed home a second on 32. Ryan Giggs all but sealed the victory when he played a short corner to Park Ji-Sung, got the return ball, nutmegged Robert Snodgrass, and shot past Andrew Lonergan via a deflection off Luciano Becchio. Late on, Ramn Nez, a Leeds substitute, fluffed the chance to score a consolation for Leeds, firing wide. The draw for the Fourth Round took place on 24 September 2011, and gave United a trip to the EBB Stadium to take on League Two side Aldershot Town. The match was played on 25 October 2011, with United once again winning 30, through goals from Dimitar Berbatov, Michael Owen, and Antonio Valencia. The draw for the quarter-finals took place on 29 October 2011, and gave United a home match against Championship side Crystal Palace. Crystal Palace took the lead in the 65th minute, with a 40-yard strike from Darren Ambrose. However their lead lasted less than 4 minutes, with Macheda equalising from the penalty spot, after he was fouled himself, in the 69th minute. Despite increasing Manchester United pressure, the match went to extra-time, where Crystal Palace scored a second, with a Glenn Murray header, to put them 21 ahead in the 98th minute. The game eventually ended 21, with Crystal Palace facing Cardiff City in Semi-final, a game which secured a Championship side in the final. Manchester United began their UEFA Champions League campaign in the group stage after finishing in first place in the 201011 Premier League. The draw for the group stage was made on 25 August 2011. As one of the top eight-ranked teams in Europe, the club was seeded in Pot 1, meaning that they would avoid being drawn with defending champions Barcelona, as well as Bayern Munich, Internazionale, Porto, Real Madrid and the other three English clubs, Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City.[13] The draw eventually paired United with two previous opponents, Benfica and Swiss champions Basel, and one new opponent, Romanian champions Oelul Galai. United's first UEFA Champions League group game was away to Benfica on 14 September 2011, which ended in a 11 draw. Nicols Gaitn's delightful long pass picked out scar Cardozo in the 24th minute, and he controlled on his chest then finished from 16 yards. But three minutes before half-time Ryan Giggs cut inside from the right and fired a 20-yard strike to equalise. United keeper Anders Lindegaard saved from Nolito and Gaitn late on. United's next game in the Champions League was a home game against Basel. Two goals from Danny Welbeck in the 16th and 17th minutes looked to have put United in control. Welbeck's first goal came when he scuffed a shot in off the post, and the England forward's second was a far more convincing strike from Ryan Giggs' cross. Fabian Frei shot in off the post on 58 minutes to give Basel hope, and Alexander Frei's header, aided by awful defending from Rio Ferdinand, made it 22. With 15 minutes remaining, Basel were awarded a penalty and Alexander Frei sent David de Gea the wrong way to give Basel a shock lead and leave United on the brink of a first home defeat in almost 18 months. However, in the 90th minute, Ashley Young headed home Nani's cross at the back post to rescue a point. United could have nabbed all 3 points had substitute Dimitar Berbatov not shot into the side-netting rather than play it along the ground for a tap-in. Instead, United were forced to settle for a point, as they went down to 3rd in Group C. This was the first time since 1999 that United had failed to win either of their first two Champions League group stage matches. United went on to win both their fixtures against Oelul Galai 20, with two penalties, both scored by Rooney, leading United to victory away from home, and an early goal from Valencia and a late own goal from Srghi to ensure a 20 United victory at Old Trafford. However, a 22 draw in Matchday 5 against Benfica and an unlikely 21 loss against Basel at St. Jakob-Park meant that United failed to progress past the group stage of the Champions League for only the third time in 17 years. According to football finance blogger Andy Green (a.k.a. "andersred"), United's failure to progress beyond the group stage of the Champions League could cost them up to 20million, mostly in lost TV revenue.[14] As a result of finishing third in their group, United played in the Europa League (formerly the UEFA Cup) for the first time since the 199596 season. They entered the tournament at the Round of 32 stage. As one of the top four of the eight third-placed Champions League teams, United were seeded for the Round of 32 draw which took place at 12:00 GMT on 16 December 2011. United were drawn against Ajax of the Netherlands. The only previous meeting between the two sides came in the 1st Round of the same competition in the 197677 season, United winning 21 on aggregate thanks to goals from Lou Macari and Sammy McIlroy. United were away from home for the first leg on 16 February 2012. United won the game 20. United struggled to get going in the first half, and David de Gea produced a brilliant save to deny Siem de Jong. But the Red Devils looked far stronger after the break, and Ashley Young put them ahead with a drilled finish. Javier Hernndez doubled the lead late on to ensure that United took two away goals with them into the second leg at Old Trafford. The return leg was at Old Trafford on 23 February 2012. United lost 21 (their fourth home loss of the season, having lost none at home the previous season), but went through 32 on aggregate. The Red Devils took the lead through Javier Hernndez's finish following Dimitar Berbatov's fine pass. Aras zbiliz levelled for Ajax from 20 yards. Toby Alderweireld headed home the winner with three minutes to go, but the goal came too late. United were drawn with Athletic Bilbao in the Round of 16, after the Spanish side defeated Lokomotiv Moscow on away goals after a 22 aggregate draw in their Round of 32 tie. United had only met Athletic Bilbao once before, in their debut season in European football. They met in the quarter-finals of the European Cup in the 195657 season. Matt Busby's babes lost 53 in Spain, before winning 30 at Maine Road  Old Trafford was not equipped with floodlights at that time  to progress 65 on aggregate. The second leg was played on 6 February 1957, and the majority of the players who played that day would perish exactly a year later at Munich. The first leg of the tie against Athletic Bilbao ended in a 32 defeat for United at Old Trafford on 8 March 2012. Wayne Rooney smashed United ahead from close range, before Fernando Llorente's header drew the visitors level. But the cavalier Spaniards refused to settle for a draw, as United failed to win yet another European home game. The hosts were stunned by second-half goals from scar de Marcos and Iker Muniain, before a late Rooney penalty. This was United's 5th home defeat of the season, having lost none at home the previous season. United travelled to the San Mams Stadium for the second leg of tie, on 15 March 2012. Having lost the first leg, United needed to win at least 20 to progress. However, United lost 21 on the night and 53 on aggregate, meaning that they tumbled out of Europe. Iker Muniain hit the post, before Fernando Llorente scored a fantastic volley from Fernando Amorebieta's raking diagonal pass. Ryan Giggs then headed wide, but scar de Marcos put further daylight between the sides when he crashed in. Wayne Rooney scored from 25 yards late on, but it was merely a consolation.
