Ryan Williams (born April 9, 1990 in Cold Spring, New York) is an American football running back for the Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League. He played college football at Virginia Tech and was drafted in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft. Williams attended Stonewall Jackson High School in Manassas, Virginia. He was the starting tailback all four years. He finished with over 3,000 rushing yards, including 1,574 yards as a junior. As a freshman at Virginia Tech in 2008, Williams was redshirted. As a redshirt freshman in 2009, Williams took over as starting running back after starter Darren Evans suffered a season-ending ACL injury.[1] Through thirteen games he rushed for 1,655 yards on 293 carries, scored 21 touchdowns, and broke multiple Virginia Tech and ACC rushing records in the process - including Virginia Tech's single season rushing yards record, the ACC single season rushing touchdown record, and the ACC single season touchdown record with 22 touchdowns.[2] He began the 2010 season as a starter but injured his right hamstring in a game against East Carolina University and was out for four games before coming back against Duke. On January 9, 2011, it was announced that Williams will give up his final 2 years of NCAA eligibility to make himself available for the 2011 NFL Draft.[3] In the 2011 NFL Draft, Williams was selected in the 2nd Round, 38th overall by the Arizona Cardinals. On August 19, 2011 during a pre-season football game against the Packers, Williams was injured early in the third quarter in his first run of the game. He suffered from a ruptured patella tendon in his right knee and missed the entire 2011 season.
