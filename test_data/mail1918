Peggy J. Kleinplatz is a Canadian clinical professor, psychologist, and sexologist whose work often concerns optimal sexuality, opposition to the medicalization of human sexuality, and outreach to marginalized groups.[1][2] Kleinplatz graduated from University of Ottawa with a B.A. (Honours) in Psychology in 1981 and Ph.D. in 1987. She is a full Professor of Medicine[3] and Clinical Professor of Psychology at the University of Ottawa, where she was awarded the Prix d'excellence, and is an Adjunct Research Professor at Carleton University.[4][5] Kleinplatz and physician Charles Allen Moser argue that paraphilias should be removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Kleinplatz wrote, "[T]he DSM criteria for diagnosis of unusual sexual interests as pathological rests on a series of unproven and more importantly, untested assumptions."[6] She has also criticized the concepts Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder[7] and dyspareunia as medicalizing women's bodies.[8]
