Stump and Stumpy were a dance/comedy/acting duo popular from the mid 1930s to the 1950s, consisting of James "Stump" Cross, and either Eddie Hartman or Harold Cromer as "Stumpy". Their act was mostly jazz tap, and comedy expressed through song and movement. James 'Jimmy' Cross and Edward 'Eddie' Hartman, traveled around the United States on what was often called the 'Black Vaudeville' circuit, under management of Nat Nazarro. In 1943, Cross was cast in the United States Army's This Is the Army film, with William Wycoff as his 'partner'. Stumpy and Stumpy's first big success was appearing in the movie Boarding House Blues (1948), after which Hartman had become unreliable as a performer, and was replaced with Cromer. Harold Cromer was the M.C. for numerous Irvin Feld-produced rock and roll package tours in the late 1950's. He danced with LaVern Baker as she sang "Jim Dandy" and thus was billed as Harold "Jim Dandy" Cromer for most of these tours.
