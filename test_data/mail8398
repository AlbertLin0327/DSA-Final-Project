Thomas Lawlor was an Irish Labour Party politician and trade union official.[1] In 1925 the Labour Party identified high taxation as a government weakness and decided to contest the Dublin South and Dublin North by-elections. Lawlor, as general secretary of the Irish Municipal Employees Union was the candidate in Dublin South, with Denis Cullen of the Irish Bakers Union running in Dublin North.[2] Neither of them were elected. Lawlor was first elected to Dil ireann as a Labour Party Teachta Dla (TD) for the Dublin South constituency at the June 1927 general election.[1] He lost his seat at the September 1927 general election.[3] He was an unsuccessful candidate at the 1932 general election but re-gained his seat at the 1937 general election. He lost his seat again at the 1938 general election.
