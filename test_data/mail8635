"Freak" (born as Walter Kozielski), is a radio personality in Chicago, Illinois. Kozielski was a cohort of the Chicago-based, nationally syndicated morning radio talk show, Mancow's Morning Madhouse, hosted by Erich "Mancow" Muller for 9 years.[1][2][3] He was raised on Chicago's Northwest side just a few blocks from the famous Rolling Stone Records store and John Wayne Gacy's residence. His first job was at the Harlem & Irving Plaza (H.I.P.) as a game room attendant at Aladdin's Castle. He graduated from Prosser Vocational High School in Chicago in 1985. His start in radio happened by chance when a friend got him a job at WTMX-FM (The Mix - 101.9 FM). He began at the station using his childhood nickname "Cap" playing music by the likes of Celine Dion, Michael Bolton, & Wilson Phillips until the chance to work at The Blaze (103.5 FM) surfaced and he jumped on it. The Blaze later became Rock 103.5 and he stayed aboard and it was there that he hooked up with a new morning show from San Francisco called Mancow's Morning Madhouse. Kozielski was with Mancow's Morning Madhouse since the show's debut in 1994 and became "Freak" then. He was best known as Mancow's traffic reporter and was nominated for A.I.R. Awards 5 times winning twice in 1997 & 2002. Kozielski also did music news, occult themed news, and other show segments such as Street Life and Beat the Freak. Kozielski left Mancow's Morning Madhouse in November 2003 to join 94.7 The Zone (WZZN) where he worked until it was sold in 2006. Freak then went to WRXQ-FM 100.7 in southwest suburban Chicago. [4]. There he hosted weekday afternoons 3-7p as well as the biker-themed Road Rash Radio Sunday mornings from 10a-Noon[2]until exiting August 25th, 2011. He is currently the Program Director for WYKT-105.5 The Kat, a rock station on Chicago's south side where he also does afternoon drive Mon-Fri 3p-8p. He can also be heard doing mid-days on KZZK-105.9 The Grizz in Quincy Illinois. Freak is also the track announcer for the dirt oval at Rt. 66 Raceway in Joliet Illinois calling the team demolition derby action. Freak is also the P.R. Director for the Will County chapter of A.B.A.T.E. Freak also wrote for the biker-themed Saddle Tramp Magazine.[5][6] as well as a music magazine out of Indiana called The Midwest Beat. He was approached to do a number of "Go Green" commercials in 2009 however, the deal never came to fruition because he did not join the Screen Actors Guild[7] Freak opened a bar called Freakster's Roadhouse on Historic Rt. 66 (Rt. 53) in Wilmington, Illinois in May of 2011.[8]
