The People's Socialist Party (Spanish: Partido Socialista Popular, PSP) was a Spanish political party. The origins of the party dated back to 1954 when the University professor, Enrique Tierno Galvn published various academic studies of a Marxist character.[1] In 1965, working together with Ral Morodo, he formed the Castillian Socialist Federation (Federacin Socialista Castellana).[1] Two years later, the party became the 'Partido Socialista del Interior' or the Socialist Party of the Interior, reflecting the fact that most of its members were based in Spain in contrast to the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), many of whose members were exiles.[1] The party attempted to reach agreements with the PSOE, but ideological differences proved insurmountable.[1] During the Francisco Franco dictatorship it was an illegal underground movement on University Campuses, and it adopted the Popular Socialist Party name in 1974. Its President was Tierno Galvn. That same year the party formed the Spanish Democratic Junta (Junta Democrtica de Espaa) together with the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) and Carlist Party. It defined itself as socialist and Marxist[1] and in contrast to the PSOE, which had a base in the Trade Union movement, many PSP members were University Professors and intellectuals.[1] The PSP stood in the Spanish general election, 1977 in coalition with a number of regional left wing movements especially the Socialist Party of Andalusia (where they stood under the name 'Socialist Unity'). Overall the PSP won 816,582 votes (4.46%) and 6 deputies.[2] In February 1978 the party began entering into discussions with other parties such as the Communist Party of Spain and the PSOE about possible future electoral cooperation. Although Tierno denied suggestions of mergers during those discussions,[3] the party congress voted in favour of a merger with the PSOE on 1 April 1978[4] and this was concluded at a joint press conference between Tierno and Felipe Gonzalez, the PSOE leader in April 1978.[5] and the following year Tierno Galvn was elected Mayor of Madrid by the PSOE and PCE.
