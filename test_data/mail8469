The Drug Information Association (DIA) is a nonprofit, worldwide association that aims to foster innovation, improve public health globally and provide a forum for knowledge exchange. It has over 23,000 members in more than eighty countries drawn from the discovery, development and management disciplines of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The DIA was founded in 1964 in the state of Maryland, United States by a group of thirty professionals employed in the pharmaceutical industry and drug research in universities. In the early years there was an annual meeting with occasionally an extra event on a specific topic. By the 1980s there was a much increased membership and many more activities. Training courses, meetings and conferences increased in number to over 30 each year, with some being held in Canada, Europe and Japan. In 1991, a European branch office was opened in Basle and one in Sydney, Australia, and in 1999, one was opened in Tokyo, Japan. Drug Information Association
