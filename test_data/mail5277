This is a list of North American countries by population, which also includes Central America and the Caribbean islands (both the Greater and Lesser Antilles). The table is primarily based on estimates by the United Nations Population Division. The list is by default sorted by the UN column.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
