The Municipality of Alexandria was a former Local Government Area of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It was bounded by the Eveleigh railway yards and Boundary Street to the north, Botany Road in the east, Canal and Gardners roads to the south and crossing through the suburbs of St Peters and Erskineville in the west. [1] The small municipality was initially a ward (along with Waterloo) of the borough of Redfern created under the Municipalities Act of 1858. The Waterloo Municipal Council was then proclaimed in 1860, followed by Alexandria Municipality in 1868. Over the next sixty years there were few alterations to municipal boundaries centred around the suburb of Alexandria. Rapid industrial and residential development occurred from the 1880's, with the population of the municipality recorded as 7499 in 1705 dwellings by April 1891. [2] By 1891, the tramline along Botany road was constructed, the road itself the major thoroughfare in the municipality being laid out in 1821. By 1949 the municipality as one of the so-called 'slum municipalities' was merged into the City of Sydney located immediately to the north under the Local Government (Areas) Act 1948. The Alexandria Town Hall, constructed in 1928 [3] is located in Garden Street in Alexandria.
