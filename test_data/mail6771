This article is about a Sumerian literature genre. For the Polish city see: Bag Balag (meaning harper in Sumerian), is a Sumer literature genre. These are hymns for Gods presented by priests. It was usually before ersemmas. It is similar to other Sumer hymns, though its text is usually repetitive. End of these poems also have some reference to this method. This prayer should be repeated. (Literally turn back to its original place) It is the first known example of liturgical repetition. It was a vital genre from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC to the cuneiform script. These texts were copied in the Seleucid Empire and in the Parthian Empire also.
