Asilomorpha Muscomorpha Stratiomyomorpha Tabanomorpha Vermileonomorpha Xylophagomorpha Brachycera is a suborder of Diptera. It is a major suborder consisting of around 120 families. The most distinguishing characteristic of the suborder is reduced antenna segmentation. A summary of main physiological characteristics follows: Brachyceran flies can also be distinguished through behavior. Many of the species are predators or scavengers. The structures of subgroups within the Brachycera is a source of much confusion and controversy; many of the names used historically (e.g. Orthorrhapha) have not been used in decades, but still persist in textbooks, checklists, faunal catalogs, and other sources. Additionally, most recent classifications no longer use the Linnaean ranks for taxa (e.g., the Tree of Life Web Project), and this creates its own set of problems. See discussion for details. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
