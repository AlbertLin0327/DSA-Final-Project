WCBE (90.5 FM) is a public radio station in Columbus, Ohio that began broadcasting in 1956. Initially, the station carried only locally produced education programs, but was the first station in Columbus to affiliate with National Public Radio and began carrying NPR programs in the 1970's. By the 1980's, the station had transitioned to a mix of NPR News and classical music. In 1990, the station switched musical formats to music classified as adult album alternative (AAA or Triple-A). Today, WCBE is a NPR member station and also carries programs distributed by Public Radio International. The station carries most of the major public radio programs, including Morning Edition, All Things Considered, Car Talk, and Prairie Home Companion, as well as several locally produced music programs. The WCBE call sign represents the station's licensee, the Columbus Board of Education (Columbus City Schools). From WCBE.org: Coordinates: 395748N 830017W / 39.9634N 83.0046W / 39.9634; -83.0046
