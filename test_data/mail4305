The Rubashkin family is a family of American ultra-Orthodox Jews of the Lubavitcher Hasidic movement of Brooklyn, New York, headed by Aaron Rubashkin. Members of the family were or are active in various family businesses, most of them in the family's main business, kosher meat, for which they earned the title "kosher meat dynasty". The tight-knit family has been influential in its local area and is well known among religious Jews for its generosity towards Jews and Jewish causes. Some of the family's activities have been controversial, and a few of its members have been the subject of legal investigations and convictions. Several members of the family and some of the family's companies have faced legal problems. A musical production supporting the family's efforts to secure the release of Sholom Rubashkin from federal prison, made its debut on October 13, 2010. "The Rubashkin name has always been synonymous with charity as the Rubashkins gave of themselves, both financially and otherwise, to help those in need." An in-depth documentary of the charitable efforts of the Rubashkin family will be released before the end of 2010.[29]
