Cheikh Tidiane Tour (born January 25, 1970) is a Senegal-born French athlete who specialised in the long jump. He retired after the 2003 season. His best international performance came in the 1997 World Championships, where he finished 7th. His personal best jump was 8.46, a result he achieved in Bad Langensalza on June 15, 1997. As this happened before he became a French citizen, the result was an African record which stood for over twelve years. Ignisious Gaisah of Ghana jumped 8.51 m at the 2006 African Championships in Athletics, but as the tail wind was too strong (+3.7m/s) the result could not become a new record [1]. On July 4, 2009, Godfrey Khotso Mokoena of South Africa jumped 8.50 m in Madrid setting a new record.  1965: Edward Akika (NGR)
