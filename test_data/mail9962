Hurrungane (also written Hurrungene, Hurrungadn, Horungane) is a mountain range in the municipalities Luster and rdal in Sogn og Fjordane, Norway. The area is southwest in the larger mountain range Jotunheimen and is also part of Jotunheimen National Park.[1] The range has some of the most alpine peaks in Norway, and has 24 peaks over 2,000 metres (6,600ft) (counting peaks with larger prominence than 30 metres/ 98 feet). Several of the peaks are only accessible through climbing or glacier crossings. The starting point for hiking is the village of Turtagr along the national tourist road, Sognefjellsvegen (RV55). The highest peaks in the area are Hurrungane is the finite plural of a word hurrung. Hurrungen, the finite singular of the same word, is the names of two mountains in Rauma and Skjk. The first element is the verb hurra which means "hurry, move fast (with noise and roar)". The last element is the suffix -ung, referring to an active thing/person. The actual mountains are steep, and there are frequent rockslides and avalanches from the hillsides. The meaning of the name is then "the noisemakers".[2] Coordinates: 6127N 751E / 61.45N 7.85E / 61.45; 7.85
