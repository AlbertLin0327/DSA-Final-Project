A fourth Idaho temple was subsequently dedicated in Twin Falls, Idaho temple later in 2008. The temple sits on the south end of the Brigham Young University-Idaho campus on the south side of Rexburg. BYU-Idaho had been the only LDS university without a temple adjacent to its campus. The design of this temple differs from most in that the exterior was designed by a private firm, not the LDS Church's architectural department. This was done because the church wished it to have a fresh new look.[citation needed] The temple has 2 progressive endowment and 5 sealing rooms.[2] On August 30, 2007, it was announced that the temple's open house would begin on December 29, 2007 and run through January 26, 2008. The dedication was to be held on February 3, 2008; however, due to the death of Gordon B. Hinckley and his funeral planned for February 2, 2008, the dedication was postponed one week and was dedicated on February 10 by new Church President Thomas S. Monson.[3] Val R. Christensen is the temple's first president.[4][5] The temple rests atop a shield volcano, as does much of the city.
