Arenella is a neighbourhood of Naples, southern Italy. It is on the Vomero hill above the city and was, at approximately 300 meters in elevation, many years ago considered a place to go to "get away from it all." It is adjacent to the main hospital section of the city, set somewhat higher, on the way up to the Hermitage of Camaldoli. It has some points of historic interest, such as the presence of the workshop of Giambattista della Porta. Coordinates: 405157N 141320E / 40.86589N 14.2221E / 40.86589; 14.2221
