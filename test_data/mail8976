Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology is a peer reviewed medical journal published by Maney Publishing. It publishes reviews, historical perspectives, original articles, book reviews, and other features covering tropical disease, including microbiology, epidemiology, molecular biology, medical entomology, HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The editor-in-chief is Andrea Crisanti (Imperial College London). The journal was established by Nobel Laureate, Sir Ronald Ross in 1906. He founded the journal to share the results of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine's research and field expeditions. The first volumes of the journal also saw publication of submissions from scientists outside of the Liverpool School.[1] In May 2011, the journal was purchased by Maney Publishing. In 2012, the journal will be renamed Pathogens and Global Health, reflecting a broader focus for the journal that includes the biology, immunology, genetics, treatment, and control of pathogens of medical relevance beyond a regional definition.[2]
