H. Ernie Schreiber MA was the founding interim leader of the Progressive Canadian (PC) Party from 2004 until his resignation due to a heart condition in 2005. Schreiber was born in Nuremberg, Germany in 1929 and was a civilian employee for the United States Army in West Germany following graduation from high school.[1] Schreiber moved to Canada in 1955 after leaving the US Army and settled in Ottawa, Ontario to worked for Bell-Northern Research (later as Nortel) and retired in 1992 as editor for technical publications.[1] A political outsider, Schreiber entered the federal politician scene when he became the leader of the Progressive Canadian Party of Canada, a party founded by Red Tories to challenge the Conservative Party of Canada as the true Tory party in Canada. He was a member of the Ottawa South PC Party Association, but he never ran as a candidate for the party. His health led to his short political life and retired as leader in 2005. After retiring as PC Party leader, Schreiber remains politically active and occasionally comments on politics in the media and online. In 1981, Schreiber graduated from Concordia University with a Masters in English literature. From 1982 to 1990 he was director of German Language School in Ottawa, Ontario.[1]
