Old John is a folly atop the highest hill in Bradgate Park, Leicestershire, England. It was built in 1784, by the Grey family of Groby, and was originally an observation tower built to give the ladies a view of a race course which circled the top of the hill. It is well known for its "mug-shape", the 'handle' of which was added later, supposedly in memory of a beer-loving family retainer. In the past it has been used as a meeting place for hunters with their fox hounds, a luncheon house for shooting parties in the park, and an observation tower at the centre of a one-mile long practice horse gallop. Below the tower is the remains of a walled enclosure built into the rock face which was formerly a stable for the horses.
