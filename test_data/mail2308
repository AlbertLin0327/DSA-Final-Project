Clive Scott is a professor of European Literature at the University of East Anglia and the author of many ground-breaking books on French poetry.[1] Scott's book Channel Crossings: French and English Poetry in Dialogue 1550-2000 (Legenda, 2002) was awarded the 2003 R. H. Gapper Book Prize by the UK Society for French Studies. This prize recognises the work as the best book published by a scholar working in Britain or Ireland in French studies in 2002.[2] Scott became a fellow of the British Academy in 1994.[3]
