Polymastia lorum is a species of demosponge belonging to the family Polymastiidae. It is only known from a single specimen found attached to a dead Glycimeris valve on a reef near Ohinau Island, one of the Mercury Islands off North Island, New Zealand. This is a small encrusting sponge 4 cm across. The outer layer is yellow with an orange-red interior. The most remarkable feature of this sponge is the very long (up to 6 cm) strap-like papillae.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
