Pinuccio Sciola (born 1942) is a sculptor and muralist from San Sperate, Sardinia.[1] His work has been mentioned as a major attraction of the nearby town of Assemini.[2] His work has also been exhibited in Alghero.[3] Forms in which he works include pietre sonore or "sound stones": large sculptures (mainly limestones or basalts) that resonate when rubbed by human hands or small rocks.[4]
