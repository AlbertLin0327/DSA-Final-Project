Mike Berry (born Michael Hubert Bourne, 24 September 1942, Northampton, Northamptonshire, England[1]) is an English actor and singer, best known for his appearances as Mr. Spooner on the British sitcom Are You Being Served?. He had three hits in the 1960s in the UK Singles Chart (notably "Tribute To Buddy Holly").[2] His first singles were produced by Joe Meek. In the mid-1970s he returned to the charts in the Netherlands and Belgium, as pirate radio station Radio Mi Amigo played his new record material, released on Dutch record label Pink Elephant Records. "Don't Be Cruel" made #14 in the Dutch Top 40 in May, 1975. His next record, a remake of his 1960 debut song "Tribute to Buddy Holly", hit #2 in October of that same year. In 1977 a song "I'm A Rocker", released on Flemish record label Scramble Records (owned by Radio Mi Amigo DJ Norbert) failed to chart. In the late 1970s he played Mr. Peters, the father of the two children in the TV version of the Worzel Gummidge books, along with Jon Pertwee and Una Stubbs. His character, Bert Spooner, replaced Trevor Bannister's Mr. Lucas in Are You Being Served? in 1981, and stayed until the end of the show's run in 1985. In 1980, he had a chart success in the UK, with "The Sunshine of Your Smile", a cover version of a romantic song which was produced by Chas Hodges; this had originally been written before the First World War and recorded by Jessie Broughton in about 1912. In 1985, his song "Everyone's A Wally" was included as the b-side to the video game by Mikro-Gen of the same name. His most recent CD was About Time Two, recorded in Nashville, Tennessee with The Crickets. His most recent film work was acting in Julie and the Cadillacs (1999). [2]
