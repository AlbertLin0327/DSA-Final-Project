La Charit-sur-Loire Coordinates: 471040N 30111E / 47.1778N 3.0197E / 47.1778; 3.0197 La Charit-sur-Loire is a commune in the Nivre department in central France. The town began as the first of the Cluniac priories on an island site in the Loire. A great fire ravaged the town in 1559. In the French Wars of Religion, it was one of the fortified towns granted as Huguenot safe havens by the Peace of Saint-Germain (August 1570). In the Second War the fortified town withstood eight months of siege by Catholic forces. By the time of the French Revolution only a dozen monks remained in the priory, which was sold to private individuals and preserved. An improved highway that was to be driven through the church was deflected by the report of Prosper Merime, the first inspector of monuments (and author of Carmen) who classed it as worth saving in 1840. At the 1999 census, the population was 5,460. On 1 January 2005, the estimate was 5,405. The priory stands as a ruin. Simon I de Senlis was buried in it. The church Sainte-Croix-Notre-Dame was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998, as part of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France.
