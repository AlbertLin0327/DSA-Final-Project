Don't speak Spanish? Click here to read a machine-translated version of the Spanish article. Mario Roberto Santucho (1936-1976) was an Argentine revolutionary. He was the leader of ERP (People's Army Revolucionary, in English). He was killed by the military in a shootout after his hideout was undercovered in 1976. His wife Liliana Delfino was also killed by the military of Argentina the same year.
