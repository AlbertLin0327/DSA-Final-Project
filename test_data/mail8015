Miles Miller was a 20th-century architect in Utah. He was a graduate of Latter Day Saint University and the University of Utah. He worked in a firm with Clifford Percy Evans and Taylor Woolley between 1917-1922 in Salt Lake City, Utah. Two of his works, the Parowan 3rd Ward Meetinghouse (1914)[1] and Central Park Ward Chapel (1927),[2] represent Prairie School architecture. He also designed the Carbon Stake Tabernacle which was completed in 1914 (demolished 1981).[3]
