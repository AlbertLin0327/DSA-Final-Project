Command Performance is a radio program which originally aired between 1942 and 1949. The program was broadcast on the Armed Forces Radio Network (AFRS) with a direct shortwave transmission to the troops overseas. It was not broadcast over domestic U.S. radio stations. Troops sent in requests for a particular performer or program to appear, and they also suggested unusual ideas for music and sketches on the program, such as Ann Miller tap dancing in military boots. Top performers of the day appeared, including Jack Benny, Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, Fred Allen, Ginger Rogers, Judy Garland and The Andrews Sisters. One memorable program, a 55-minute musical adaptation of Dick Tracy, was broadcast on February 15, 1945. Bing Crosby had the title role in Dick Tracy in B Flat with Dinah Shore as Tess Truehart and Jimmy Durante as the Mole. The supporting cast included Judy Garland, Cass Daley, Frank Sinatra, Frank Morgan, Bob Hope, Harry von Zell, Jerry Colonna, Lou Crosby, the Andrews Sisters and the Joe Lilley Chorus. The program generally ran for 30 minutes outside of holiday and other specials, continuing well after WWII for a total of more than 400 programs. A spinoff series, Request Performance, aired on CBS in 1945-46. In 2009, the Pentagon Channel revived the show with some of today's newest acts. The AFRS produced several similar radio music and variety programs during WWII including the following.
