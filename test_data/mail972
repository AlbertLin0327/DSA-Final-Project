Cymopterus deserticola is a species of flowering plant in the carrot family known by the common names desert cymopterus or desert springparsley. This distinctive plant is endemic to California, where it grows in the sands of the Mojave Desert. It has no stem, instead sending its erect petioles holding the leaves and erect peduncles bearing the flowers straight out of the sand. Each leaf upon the petiole is a dull green and thick and fleshy, divided into several rubbery-looking leaflets which are again divided into triangular pointed lobes. The inflorescence is a spherical umbel of tiny purplish corollas surrounded by large green bracts.
