Maureen G. Mulvaney, better known as MGM, (born 1950 in Portsmouth, Virginia) is a former American special education teacher and college psychology instructor. Mulvaney is currently an internationally known Certified Speaking Professional (National Speakers Association CSP earned designation), published author and co-Author of 4 books, Amazon Best Selling Author of The Womens Millionaire Club, and entrepreneur (President/CEO of MGM & Associates, INC). Maureen Mulvaney is one of three children born, in 1950, to Marie and Paul Mulvaney, a US Naval Officer. The Mulvaneys named their oldest daughter, Maureen G. Mulvaney, as it was both lyrical and Irish but mostly so the initials would be MGMtheir Big Production. Marie Mulvaney was the Queen of Spaced Repetition. Maxwell Maltzs [1] was noted for coining the term Spaced Repetition. By repeating the same phrases, either positive or negative, six times a day, for 21 days, one would create a positive or negative habit. Marie, unknowingly, used Maltz's techniques to reinforce positive statements with Maureen by repeatedly telling her, You are funny. You are MGM--a big production. One day, you'll be on stage speaking before thousands of people. Marie's positive practices of repeating powerful statements to her daughter succeeded. Maureen, unconsciously, started taking interest in speaking. First, she became a special educator/ elementary teacher. Then she progressed to teaching college psychology. Finally, she used the speaking skills she had learned through teaching and combined them with the skills she had learned from her beloved sorority experiences [2] to live up to Maries expectation by becoming an internationally known speaker. Organically, people stopped calling her Maureen and began to call herMGM, a big production. Mulvaney earned a B.S. dual major in Special Education and Elementary Education from Troy State University, in Troy, Alabama. She earned an Ed.M. from Boston University, overseas program, in counseling psychology. Mulvaney is a sister of Alpha Delta Pi Sorority, the first secret society for college women in the world. She earned a Certified Speaking Professional (CSP) designation from the National Speakers Association.[3] It was the strength and courage of both her Grandmother and Mother that inspired Mulvaney to seek information about positive women role models who became successful. Butis was the shocking statistic of women in poverty that pushed her into action to write a book to help, not only herself, but other women. Mulvaney wanted to know how the successful women entrepreneurs became both personally and financially successful. Mulvaney took all the recipes for success that she learned from successful women, including her grandmother, mother, women biographies, and interviewed millionaires, and complied them into her book, The Womens Millionaire Club. Her book provides insights into The Closely Guarded SECRET SUCCESS RECIPES of Millionaire Women for Building and Owning a Millionaire Dollar Home-Based Business. (ISBN 978-096169-238-4) The Womens Millionaire Club [11] Mulvaney wanted a simple Success Recipe that anyone could use to create success in their life, whether they were rich or poor or skilled or unskilled. In her book, The Women's Millionaire Club she defines her Secret Success Recipe as follows: Dara Torres, 2008 Beijing Olympian, said, "If I can do it, you can too. Dont put an age on your dreams." Thoughts form your pictures of reality. The unconscious mind has the power to control all of your important life decisions. Decide to change your language. Your picture of reality will change. Vivid new pictures allow rapid access to the unconscious. The language you use programs the Reality you Experience! Decide What You Want and Ask for It. Synopsis: Whether you believe you can, or you cant, you are right, said Henry Ford. Beliefs are what you hold to be certain truth whether it is true or not. To change your Beliefs develop a new picture of reality, use different language and gain new information through self-development. Synopsis: Once you make a decision, the universe conspires to make it happen, said Ralph Waldo Emerson. To create a Successful life or business, Take Actions that promote human value and service to others. Focus attention on building and maintaining long-term relationships. 100% of the Women Millionaires had WRITTEN Goals and Visions! Take Consistent Action to learn what you do not know. Take Consistent Action to repeat what you do know until it is perfected. Synopsis: If you learn to appreciate more of what you already have, youll find yourself having more to appreciate. -Author Unknown Gratitude is an attitude that generates positive emotions in others.
