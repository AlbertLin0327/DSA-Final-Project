The assassination of Mehmet Baydar and Bahadr Demir refers to the murder of the Turkish Los Angeles Consul General Mehmet Baydar and Consul Bahadr Demir inCaliforniaon 27 January 1973. They were murdered by an Armenian-American Gourgen Yanikian, who invited the Turkish diplomats to lunch and shot them dead when they showed up. This was the first in a series of Armenian militant attacks against Turkish diplomats all over the world. Yanikian was sentenced to life in prison in July 1973 for first-degree murder. He died in prison of natural causes at age 88. [1]
