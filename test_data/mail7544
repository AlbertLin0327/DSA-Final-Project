Mariner Islands (661S 1019E / 66.017S 101.15E / -66.017; 101.15Coordinates: 661S 1019E / 66.017S 101.15E / -66.017; 101.15) is a group of rocky islands and rocks forming the north-central group of the Highjump Archipelago, bounded by Edisto Channel on the west, Gossard Channel on the south, and Remenchus Glacier on the east. Mapped from air photos taken by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump, 194647, and named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) to commemorate the discovery of a large ice-free region at the west end of the Knox Coast by the crew of the PBM-Martin Mariner seaplane commanded by D.E. Bunger. During photographic reconnaissance of this coastal area in January 1947, the aircraft landed on one of the inlets indenting the Bunger Hills and ground-level photographs and water samples were obtained at that time. This article incorporatespublic domain material from the United States Geological Survey document "Mariner Islands" (content from the Geographic Names Information System).
