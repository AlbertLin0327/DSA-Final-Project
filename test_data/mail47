Mary Connery is a former camogie player, winner of the Cuchulainn award presented by Gaelic Weekly magazine in 1965.[1] She won Ashbourne Cup honours with University College Galway in 1964. In 1966 she captained St Pauls in their first All Ireland club final. While still a player, she was elected chair of Kilkenny camogie board in 1966. Although she had retired before Kilkenny won their breakthrough Leinster (1970) and All Ireland (1974) titles, she contributed substantially to the success as coach to the successful Presentation Kilkenny teams in the secondary schools championship of 1969 and 1970, on which Liz Neary, Helena ONeill, Carmel Doyle and Theresa ONeill featured. She became chair of Leinster colleges council in 1966.
