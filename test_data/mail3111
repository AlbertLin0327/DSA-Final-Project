The B14 is a two man monohull dinghy, designed by Julian Bethwaite. It is recognised as an international class by the International Sailing Federation.[1] The boat was designed in 1984 making it a fairly old class.[2] The B14 is designed with a low center of gravity for added stability and an open transom, to help the boat to drain itself quickly and without need of a self-bailer. The mast is set far back in the boat to make room for the large asymmetric spinnaker.[3][4] The boat is in the fast handicap, with a portsmouth yardstick of 870,[5] designed with racing in mind. For this reason it is highly suitable for more experienced sailors.[3] The boat does not have a trapeze,[2] but instead makes use of wide wings.[3]
