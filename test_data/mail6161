LIVAN is a UK-based alternative rock trio founded by Greek-born musician Livan. Greek-born UK musician Livan (aka Cosmas Livanos)[1] is the grandson of former Greek Prime Minister Panagiotis Kanellopoulos and has been in bands since he was 9 years old. The frontman is known for his live shows, which have been played with huge artists like Aerosmith [2] among others. The spirit of LIVAN's music has been touted as "conjuring Billy Idol circa Generation X".[3] Livan, together with guitarist Will Crewdson (ex of influential UK rockers Rachel Stamp, Malcolm McLaren and Johnette Napolitano) and drummer Damon Wilson (Ray Davies, Joss Stone), tracked his most recent release Off the Grid nearly live in the studio with engineer Nat Chan in London. Off The Grid Happy Returns Democr[i]cy Michelle St. James (Shakefire.com) described LIVAN's music as "industrial pop punk/alt-rock" going on to say that it "sounds gritty, raw, and fun with crashing guitar and thumping bass lines".[7] Jack Feerick (Pop Dose) said that the "Happy Returns" album was "currently rockin my world down to a nub" and went onto to describe the title track as sounding like "the Kaiser Chiefs meets The The with vocals by a slumming Peter Murphy".[8] Rob Smy (Spinner) compared LIVAN to Placebo and Nine Inch Nails.[9] However, Patrick Slevin (Aquarian Weekly) described LIVAN's vocals as an "acquired taste".[10]
