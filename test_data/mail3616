Ukert is a lunar impact crater that lies on a strip of rugged ground between Mare Vaporum to the north and Sinus Medii in the south. It is located to the north-northwest of the crater Triesnecker and northeast of the crater pair of Pallas and Murchison. The outer rim of this crater is not quite circular, with outward bulges to the north and the east. The interior floor is irregular in places, with a central ridge running from crater mid-point down to the southern wall. There is a tiny craterlet along the northern rim, but otherwise the crater contains no impacts of note. By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater mid-point that is closest to Ukert.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
