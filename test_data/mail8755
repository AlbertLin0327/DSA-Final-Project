Nerdlen in DAU.svg Nerdlen is an Ortsgemeinde  a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality  in the Vulkaneifel district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun, whose seat is in the like-named town. The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Nerdlen lies in the Lieser valley between Daun and Kelberg roughly 5km from Daun town centre. The small village lies among woodland, meadows and fields[2]. About 1000, Nerdlen had its first documentary mention. The municipality's name was originally Zu den Erlen (At the Alders). Through faulty separation of the last two words, this later became Nerlen, and then eventually Nerdlen. The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. Nerdlens mayor is Hermann Lenarz, and his deputies are Albert Hens and Wolfgang Maas[3]. The German blazon reads: Von Silber ber Rot geteilt, oben ein grner Erlenzweig mit drei Blttern, unten ein halbes silbernes Rad. The municipalitys arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess argent an alder sprig leafed of three and gules a demi-wheel of the first. The alder sprig is a canting charge, suggesting the municipalitys name, which is indeed derived from the German word for alder. As mentioned above, the name is a corruption of the phrase Zu den Erlen. The half-wheel below the line of partition is  in its whole form  Saint Catherines attribute, thus representing the chapels patron saint[4].
