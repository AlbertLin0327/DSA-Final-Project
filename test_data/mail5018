Discovery Travel & Living (UK & Ireland) is a TV channel in the United Kingdom and Ireland and is a channel from Discovery Networks Western Europe. Discovery Travel & Living was launched as Discovery Travel & Adventure in 1998. In early 2005, it was repositioned and rebranded as Discovery Travel & Living as a part of a "lifestyle" package from Discovery Communications, also including Discovery Home & Health and Discovery Real Time. Nowadays, much of the schedule is taken up by programmes about real estate, most notably A Place in the Sun and its spinoffs, as well as House Doctor. A one hour timeshifted version named Discovery Travel & Living +1 launched on Sky on 24 November 2008.[1] The timeshift channel closed on 20 January 2009 to make way for the launch of Investigation Discovery.
