HarrNishaan2.png The Ad-Dharmi are a Ravidassia community found in the state of Punjab in India. They are one of a number of Hindu sub-groups that have been granted Scheduled Caste status. [1] The ad-dharmi movement was started in 1920's, for the purpose of getting a distinct religious identity. The founder of the ad-dharmi movement was Mangoo Ram and B L Gherra[2]. The word ad dharm means original faith in Sanskrit, and this term was adopted by groups of Chamars who were affiliated with the Ad-Dharam Mandal, a reformist Ravidassia sect. As is common in many other parts of India, this reformist sect has evolved into a caste, with strict rules of endogamy. Marriages are even rare with other members of the Chamar caste. The Ad-Dharmi are further divided into a number of exogamous clans, the main ones being the Bangur, Bhardwaj, Bhargu, Chakhu, Chokhria, Chandar, Chumar, Hohe, Por, Rai, Rattu, Sandhu, Soniara, Sund, Suman, Sidhu, Shergill and Thind. [3] Although Ravidassias, the Ad-Dharmi are followers of Guru Ravidas, and incorporate elements of Hinduism. Each of their settlement contains a gurdwara, which both a centre of worship and as well as a focus of the community. The traditional occupation of the Ad-Dharmis was the tanning of leather, although a majority were agricultural labourers. There has greater upward mobility among scheduled caste groups in Punjab then other parts of India. As such, many Ad-Dharmis have started to migrate to towns and cities, where they have taken on a number of blue and white collar professions. A small but significant minority have also taken to education. Like other Punjabis, the Ad-Dharmis have participated in the overseas migration of the ethnic group. There are now fairly large Ad-Dharmis communities in Europe and North America, in particular the United Kingdom. [4] On May 2009, a sudden incident of killing of a Ravidassia sant Ramanand led to a huge social change when Dera Sach khand announced the establishment of new religion Ravidassia and now all ad-dharmis follow Ravidassia Religion.
