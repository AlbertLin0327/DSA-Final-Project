The 1975 Auburn Tigers football team achieved an overall record of 362 and 141 in the SEC in Ralph Shug Jordans last year as head coach at Auburn after 25 years; however, the official record would improved to 461 (24) when Mississippi State was forced to forfeit its tie that year due to NCAA imposed sanctions.[1] Three players were named to the All-SEC first team for 1975: Chuck Fletcher (OT), Rick Telhieard (DT), and Clyde Baumgartner (SP).[2] [2]
