The 1962 Tennessee Volunteers football team (variously "Tennessee", "UT" or the "Vols") represented the University of Tennessee in the 1962 college football season. Playing as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC), the team was led by head coach Bowden Wyatt, in his eighth year, and played their home games at Shields-Watkins Field in Knoxville, Tennessee. They finished the season with a record of four wins and six losses (46 overall, 26 in the SEC). The Volunteers offense scored 179 points while the defense allowed 134 points.
