Mariano Eduardo de Rivero y Ustariz (October 22, 1798]  November 6, 1857) was a prominent Peruvian scientist, geologist, mineralogist, chemist, archaeologist, politician and diplomat. His publications about his discovery of Humboldtine (an iron-oxalate), demonstrating the existence of organic-minerals, about deposits of copper and sodium nitrate (saltpeter) near Tarapac in the Atacama desert (today Chile), about bird-guano and coal in Peru and their possibilities of industrialization as well were forward-looking and made him a pioneer of mining education in South America and the most notable Peruvian scientist of the 19th century. He published many scientific articles and books about that. Mariano Eduardo de Rivero y Ustariz was born in Arequipa, Peru. His parents were Antonio Salvador de Rivero y Aranbar, captain in the Spanish Royal Army in the viceroyalty of Peru, and Maria Brgida de Ustariz y Ziga. Mariano Eduardo married February 18, 1840 Agueda Escolstica Pacheco de Salas y Salazar. They had four children, but only their daughters Candelaria and Francisca Guillermina survived childhood. Mariano Eduardo began his education in the Seminary of San Jernimo, Arequipa. As a brilliant student his parents decided in 1810 to send him in the age of twelve for a scientific study to Europe. In London visited Mariano Eduardo the independent school in Highgate (Highgate School), directed by Dr. Dowling. He focused his studies there on mathematics, physics and languages (Latin, French and German). He continued his studies 1817 in Paris in the Royal Mining School (cole royale des mines de Paris, today cole nationale suprieure des mines de Paris) where he studied mineralogy and chemistry. During that time he met as well some famous scientists, like Joseph Louis Proust, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt. When he finished his studies at the Royal Mining School, he decided in 1821 to visit some mines in the mining areas of England, France, Germany and Spain, where he learned about the usual mining techniques. He discovered a new mineral originated in Bohemia (now Czech Republic) and called it Humboldtine (an iron-oxalate), in honor to Alexander von Humboldt, his mentor and friend. He published his first scientific works about that issue among others in 1821 in France. The president of Gran-Colombia, the liberator Simn Bolvar, decided to contract European scientifics to investigate the available sources of his new formed nation, and to push with that the development of natural sciences and mining technology in South America at all. Bolivars main target of that project was to develop the economy of the young nation. The minister of Gran-Colombia in Paris, Francisco A. Zea, contracted Mariano Eduardo in May 1822, who had been highly recommended by Alexander von Humboldt, to found and to manage a mining school in Bogot together with a group of young European scientists. Therefore Mariano Eduardo made the necessary trip preparation. He bought some laboratory equipment and ordered constructions of precisions instruments for certain measurements. Mariano Eduardo returned to South America and arrived in November 1822 at La Guaira, Venezuela. He studied in Venezuela the thermal springs of Mariara and Onoto, the exploitation of mineral salts in Urao Lake and the secretion of the cow-tree (this tree produces drinkable milk) and he also made barometric observations. He left Venezuela and arrived in Bogot, Colombia, in May 1823. He inaugurated in Bogot a museum of natural history and a mining school in November 1823 as its first director. Mariano Eduardo and his scientific group did expeditions to the orient plain of Colombia. He published the report Itinerario de los Llanos de San Martn y del ro Meta in his Coleccin de memorias cientficas , printed in 1857. Simon Bolivar (president of Gran-Colombia 1819 - 1830 and also president of Peru 1824-1827) enabled Manuel Eduardos return to his home country Peru. Mariano Eduardo left Bogot and arrived in Lima at the end of 1825. The government of Peru appointed him in March 1826 as general director of mining, agriculture, public instruction and museum. He founded in 1828 the first Mining School of Lima (today Universidad Nacional de Ingeniera) and the first National Museum of Natural History, Antiquities and History of Peru (today Museo Nacional de Arqueologa Antropologa e Historia del Per). Mariano Eduardo made scientific studies, traveled through Peru and founded in Lima with Nicolas Fernandez de Pirola a journal of natural sciences (Memorial de Ciencias Naturales y de Industria Nacional y Extranjera), where he published between 1827 and 1829 a lot of scientific articles and papers about amalgamation of silver, exploitation of guano, analysis of the mineral water from the thermal springs of Yura and other locations in Arequipa, reports of the visited mine areas in Peru and description of gold, silver and ceramic idols. In 1829 general Antonio Gutirrez de la Fuente made a revolt against the government and became the new president of Peru. He cut the position of the direction of mining, because of actual economic crisis. This and the unstable political situation in Peru induced Mariano Eduardo to leave Peru and to immigrate to Chile, where he made studies about meteorology, mineralogy and geology. He returned to Peru in 1832 and got back to his previous position, continued his scientific activities and started in addition a political career. He had been elected in 1832 as a deputy to the congress for the province of Caylloma (department of Arequipa). General Felipe Santiago Salaverry, president of Peru (18351836), appointed him in 1835 to become his counselor. Under the presidency of general Agustin Gamarra (18381841) Mariano Eduardo was appointed as inspector of public works. In 1839 he was custom chief officer of Arica (today Chile). During the presidency of marshal Ramon Castilla (18441851 and 18551862) Mariano Eduardo was appointed in 1845 to become governor of the department of Junin (central Peru) and in 1848 governor of the department of Moquegua (south Peru). As governor of Junin he founded the city of San Ramon and a central mining school in Huanuco as well. The president of Peru, marshal Ramon Castilla, appointed him in 1851 as General Consul in Belgium. He was awarded by the king of Belgium with the Leopold Order and by the king of Denmark with the Dannebrog Order in appreciation his diplomatic performance. He published in Vienna 1851 with Johann Jakob von Tschudi, acting as co-author, their common publication Antigedades Peruanas about the Incas Empire. That book was a profound work about the Incas Empire, its history, origin, government system, scientific knowledge, language, religion, customs and monuments. He published in Brussels 1857 his work Coleccin de memorias cientficas, agrcolas e industriales publicadas en distintas pocas, etc.. That work, a book in 2 volumes, was a collection of his already published articles about natural science, geology, mineralogy, mining and agriculture. Mariano Eduardo de Rivero y Ustariz died in Paris on November 22, 1857.
