Pericopsis elata, the African Teak, Afromosia, or Afrormosia, is a species of legume in the Fabaceae family. It is found in Cameroon, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Ghana, and Nigeria. Illegal logging and habitat loss pose a realistic threat to the Afrormosia, which ranks among the most valued tropical timber species.[1] It is ranked CITES Appendix II, meaning that it is subject to trade regulation because it is recognised that unregulated trade puts the species at risk of extinction. The Democratic Republic of Congo has the world's largest remaining stocks of Afrormosia, which are largely confined to the quateur Province and Orientale Province.[2]
