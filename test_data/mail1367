What's Shakin is a compilation album released by Elektra Records in 1966. It featured a selection of demonstration tapes by artists Elektra was (or had been) considering for recording contracts.[citation needed] The album was also reissued in the UK under the title Good Time Music in 1967.[1] At the time, Elektra was not known as a company that dealt in rock and roll artists. The album became an underground music hit and is noted for performances by Eric Clapton immediately prior to the formation of Cream, and for containing the earliest recordings by the Lovin' Spoonful. All of the performers went on to notable careers with other labels but, in the end, only The Paul Butterfield Blues Band and Tom Rush signed with Elektra. The album is currently available on compact disc and includes a comprehensive essay about the origin of the record, written by Richie Unterberger.[2]
