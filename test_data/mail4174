KIRN is a commercial radio station licensed to Simi Valley, California, broadcasting to the Greater Los Angeles area on 670 AM. KIRN airs ethnic Iranian programming. KIRN's studios are located at the Fallbrook Mall in West Hills. AM670 came on the air as KWNK in 1984, owned by Valley Radio LLC. The license was as a result of the FCC changing the Clear Channel Rules in 1982, which permitted the establishment of lower power radio stations on the clear channel frequencies. KWNK at 670 AM was allocated this frequency after protracted hearings by the FCC. Valley Radio's Consulting Engineer was Cecil Lynch who was one of the most respected engineers in the United States. KWNK served the Simi Valley and Conejo Valleys of Ventura County with 1KW of power 24 hours. Eventually the FCC permitted Valley Radio to increase power to 5KW Daytime and 3KW Nighttime. KWNK started as a Top 40 station as 'Top Hits 67 K.Wink', with music from Prince, Duran Duran, etc... A couple of notable program directors during that period were Jim Conlee (former PD of TenQ/KTNQ, Los Angeles), and Steve Smith. During the summer of 1986, KWNK slowly became more of a AC station, playing music from the likes of Amy Grant, due to direct competition from Top 40 KIIS AM. Eventually, some of the talk shows that were on Sunday nights, moved full time. Then became a sports talk station in the mid-1990s, first carrying One-on-One Sports (now Sporting News Radio), then simulcasting the signal of "XTRA Sports 690" of the Tijuana-San Diego area. In 2001, AM690 ended the simulcast and KWNK then aired brokered-time programs for a brief period before it became "Radio Iran." Notable air personalities: Hurricane Joe Light Gary Butterworth Kidd Kelly (now Maverick on KFYV/Ventura) Anthony Edwards (not the actor) Dave Skylar (Dave Montoya) Phyllis West (who died in 2008) Al Lohman (of Lohman & Barkely fame) Dr. Laura Coordinates: 344109N 1181726W / 34.68583N 118.29056W / 34.68583; -118.29056
