Lawrenny is a village in the community council ward of Martletwy, in the county of Pembrokeshire, Wales. Lawrenny sits on a peninsula of the Cleddau estuary upriver from Milford Haven where it branches off towards Cresswell and Carew Rivers. It is in the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. Voted best village in Wales in 2007 (a competition run by Calor) Lawrenny provides most of the central rural facilities for the Martletwy ward, including a shop, mobile post office, cricket and football clubs, village hall and church. The community owns and operates the Millennium Youth Hostel. The village also has its own broadband service, operated by a community run company. This service provides Internet across the village, and even serves communities on the other side of the Cleddau Estuary. Racing stables in the village provided Wales' first and only Grand National winner, Kirkland, in Aintree in 1905. The village extends down to the Estuary to Lawrenny Quay half a mile from the centre, where there is a busy yacht station and caravan park. The Lawrenny Arms and the Quayside Tearooms have recently become popular destinations in the area for both boaters and walkers (the community sits on the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park footpath). Historically, the community developed around fishing, boat building and as a staging point for quarried limestone extracted from quarries upriver. It also played a role in the Second World War as a base for Walrus seaplanes and a training centre, known as HMS Daedalus II, operated by the Fleet Air Arm.
