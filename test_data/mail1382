Sea Island Connector (also known as the Airport Connector Bridge) is a low-level three-lane one-way bridge in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada. It connects Bridgeport Road on Lulu Island with Grant McConachie Way on Sea Island, where the Vancouver International Airport is located. It handles traffic heading into Sea Island. Across from this bridge is the Moray Bridge, a drawbridge which handles traffic coming from Sea Island. The bridge was built in order to relieve the traffic jams on the Moray Bridge.
