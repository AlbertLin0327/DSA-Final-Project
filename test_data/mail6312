Liliuokalani Park and Gardens is a 30-acre (120,000 m2) park with Japanese gardens, located on Banyan Drive in Hilo on the island of Hawaii. The park's site was given by Queen Liliuokalani, and lies southeast of downtown Hilo, on the Waiakea Peninsula in Hilo Bay. Much of the park now consists of Edo-style Japanese gardens, built in the early 1900s, and said to be the largest such gardens outside Japan. The gardens contain Waihonu Pond as well as bridges, koi ponds, pagodas, statues, torii, and a Japanese teahouse.[1] Close to this park is the small island called Moku ola, (also known as Coconut Island), connected to the park by a footbridge. It is a good place for a picnic, and some limited swimming. The name Moku ola literally means "island of life" in the Hawaiian language, since it was site of an ancient temple dedicated to healing.[2] There is a stone tower on the east side of the island which is the remnant of the old footbridge which was destroyed by a tsunami. From Coconut Island one has a great view of Hilo Bayfront, Downtown Hilo, and the rest of Hilo Bay. To the east, you can see the massive breakwater protecting Hilo Bay. It is located at coordinates 194336N 15546W / 19.72667N 155.06833W / 19.72667; -155.06833Coordinates: 194336N 15546W / 19.72667N 155.06833W / 19.72667; -155.06833.[3] It is maintained by the County of Hawaii.[4]
