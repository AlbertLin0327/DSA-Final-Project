Levi Yehoshua Shapiro (Yiddish: . , born 1878, died 1948), better known as "Lamed Shapiro", (that is, the initial for the Hebrew letter lamed), was an American Yiddish-language writer. He was born on March 10, 1878, in Rzhyschiv, Ukraine. In 1896, he traveled to Warsaw, struggled to work for two years, then returned to the Ukraine. He experienced a pogrom, fell in love and attempted suicide, and was later conscripted into the Czar's army. These experiences would influence much of his rather dark, fictional themes. Shapiro returned to Warsaw in 1903, and I.L. Peretz helped him publish his first literary works: "Di Fligl" (The Wings); and, the next year, a longer story called "Itsikl Mamzer" (Little Isaac the Bastard), published in a journal edited by Avrom Reyzen. To Peretz he would dedicate on of his works, "Smoke," a tale of the Old World (Peretz would serve as an early benefactor of another famous Yiddish writer, Der Nister). Shapiro left for America in 1905. He stayed for a year in London, where he befriended the Hebrew writer Yosef Haim Brenner. After arriving in New York in 1906, and working for The Jewish Daily Forward, he began publishing his gruesome pogrom tales: "The Kiss" (1907); "Pour Out Thy Wrath" (1908); "The Cross" (1909); "In The Dead Town" (1910). Shapiro's work would mark a break from the three classic Yiddish writers, as violence and psychological realism foreground his work, rather than satirical commentary. Following this, Shapiro returned to Warsaw for a year, then returned permanently to the United States in 1911. By 1919, Shapiro had written what are considered his two greatest pogrom stories: "White Challah" and "The Jewish Government."[1] The two stories "remain some of the most aesthetically nuanced and psychologically complex treatments of the pogrom theme in modern Jewish literature."[2] Shapiro and his family moved to Los Angeles in 1921. His wife died there in 1927, and then he returned to New York. Back in New York yet again, Shapiro worked at several literary periodicals, was active in the communist party, and was employed by the WPA Federal Writers' Project in 1937. Shapiro returned to LA in 1939. He died there in 1948, supposedly while living in a friend's garage.[3] Curt Leviant, noted translator of Yiddish literature and a novelist in his own right, wrote his MA thesis on Shapiro: Lamed Shapiro: Master Craftsman of the Yiddish Short Stories, Columbia University, 1957. David Roskies, professor of Yiddish literature at The Jewish Theological Seminary, has done critical work on Lamed Shapiro, and places him in the context of WWI-era Jewish writers, like Isaac Babel.
