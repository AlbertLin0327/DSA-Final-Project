Steve Cook is an American former professional mountain bike racer, from Durango, Colorado[1] He was an inaugural inductee into the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame, in 1988.[1] Cook raced from 1980 to 1988, and his first major event was the NORBA Nationals in 1984, at which he took second place.[1] He also rode his custom mountain bike in cyclo-cross races (in which narrow-tired road cycles are more commonly used), and even took a state championship in that discipline.[1] After retiring from racing, Cook became the operator of a mountain bike rental shop in Crested Butte, Colorado, where he is also well-known for trailblazing, credited with the establishment of the "Single-track" trail network in the area's National Forest.[1]
