The Mildred L. Batchelder Award, or Batchelder Award, is an American Library Association literary award that annually recognizes the year's "most outstanding" children's book translated into English and published in the U.S. It is administered by the Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC), the children's division of ALA, and conferred upon the U.S. publisher. The award is named in honor of Mildred L. Batchelder, former director of the ALSC.[1] One of her stated goals was "to eliminate barriers to understanding between people of different cultures, races, nations, and languages." It seeks to recognize translations of children's books into the English language, with the intention of encouraging American publishers to translate high quality foreign language children's books and "promote communication between the people of the world". The Batchelder Award was inaugurated in 1968 and there have been 44 winners in 45 years through 2012.[2] From 1994 there have been 31 worthy runners up called Honor Books, one to three each year. The 2012 winner (publ year?) is Eerdmans Books for Young Readers, an imprint of Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., for Soldier Bear, translated by Laura Watkinson. The Dutch original Soldaat Wojtek (2008) was written by Bibi Dumon Tak, illustrated by Philip Hopman. It was announced January 23, 2012.[3] Batchelder began her career working in an Omaha, Nebraska Public Library, then as a children's librarian at St. Cloud State Teachers College, and subsequently as librarian of Haven Elementary School in Evanston, Illinois. She eventually joined the ranks of the American Library Association in 1936 spending the next 30 years at the ALA promoting the translation of children's literature.[1] Source: "Batchelder Award terms and criteria"[4] Source: "Batchelder Award Winners"[2] Winners are distinguished from Honor Books by yellow background and by 'W' in the far right column. E. P. Dutton has won five Batchelder Awards, Delacorte Press (Dell) four, and several imprints have won three: Arthur A. Levine Books (Scholastic); Lothrop, Lee & Shepard (HarperCollins); Houghton Mifflin. It appears that Scholastic Corporation and Houghton Mifflin have won five and four under all imprints. Anthea Bell's translations from Danish and German have won four Awards (plus three Honors from French and German), as have Hillel Halkin's translations from Hebrew. Translations from Greek by Edward Fenton have won three. Several people have translated two Award winners. Uri Orlev writing in Hebrew and Alki Zei writing in Greek were the authors of four and three Award-winning works, all those translated by Halkin and Fenton. Bjarne Reuter wrote two of the winners in Danish and Josef Holub two of those in German.
