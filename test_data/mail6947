Stephen Young (born May 19, 1939) is a Canadian actor. Young was born Stephen Levy in Toronto, Canada to a financier father.[1] Directly following high school, the naturally gifted teen athlete signed on for a career with the Cleveland Indians, but his professional bid ended when he seriously injured his knee playing ice hockey. He spent the next few years as a salesman, then wound up in radio and TV commercial production. While traveling with a friend on a European excursion in the early 60s, he was given by chance a bit part in the monumental film Cleopatra (1963), then landed similar minor assignments in such other European-filmed epics as 55 Days at Peking (1963), The Leopard (1963), and The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964). Upon returning to Toronto, Young decided to become a full-time actor, originally billing himself under his given name of Stephen Levy and appearing in leads on both daytime and primetime TV dramas. He headed the cast of one adventure series Seaway (1965) in which he played Nick King, part of a special police force that protected the St. Lawrence Seaway. Moving to Hollywood in 1966, he subsequently scored as young, hot-shot legal eagle Ben Caldwell, top assistant to flamboyant, high-profile criminal attorney Clinton Judd (Emmy winner Carl Betz) in the contemporary series drama Judd for the Defense (1967). The series was abruptly canceled despite its critically lauded marks after only two seasons. He progressed to high-ranking character actor mixing work in such 70s films as Patton (1970), Soylent Green (1973), and The Silent Partner (1978) with more standard filming in The Mask of Sheba (1970), Rage (1972), and Lifeguard (1976). A reliable player in mini-movies, he continued to return to his homeland from time to time where he was handed film leads in the low-budget horror thrillers The Clown Murders (1976) and Deadline (1981). Young also briefly hosted a 1980s Canadian game show called Just Like Mom. Into the millennium he continues to appear in sturdy, authoritarian roles as shown by his recent work in the crime drama The Rendering (2002), the teen horror film The Skulls II (2002), and his output on Canadian television. In 2008, Young was featured as a child psychiatrist in the Robert Downey, Jr. film Charlie Bartlett.
