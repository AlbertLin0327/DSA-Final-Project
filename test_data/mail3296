Content:
Utah's 2nd congressional district currently serves the largely rural southern and eastern portions of Utah, including Saint George and Moab in the south and Vernal in the east, as well as the east side of urban Salt Lake County, the northern portion of Utah County, and Wasatch County. The current Representative is Democrat Jim Matheson. Even though Republican presidential candidates carry the district by large margins, Matheson's moderate stances keep him in office. The reason for the unusual boundaries of Utah's 2nd congregational district is because Utah's Republican dominated legislature attempted to gerrymander the district to prevent any Democrat from being elected within the district. These attempts have thus far been unsuccessful. Matheson expects another attempt to remove him in the near future.[1] In 2002, after the district's current boundaries were established, Matheson won by only a few hundred votes. Since then, however, he has won by larger margins; in 2008 he received 63% of the vote. In 2010, he again won, though by a reduced majority, over Republican challenger Morgan Philpot, receiving 51% of the vote.[2] Utah's 2nd congressional district is the most Republican district in the nation to be represented by a Democrat.[3] Election results from presidential races[4] District borders are periodically redrawn and some district residences may no longer be in the current 2nd district. 1912  1914  1916  1918  1920  1922  1924  1926  1928  1930 (Special)  1930  1932  1934  1936  1938  1940  1942  1944  1946  1948  1950  1952  1954  1956  1958  1960  1962  1964  1966  1968  1970  1972  1974  1976  1978  1980  1982  1984  1986  1988  1990  1992  1994  1996  1998  2000  2002  2004  2006  2008  2010 Note: The 1912 election consisted of an all-party election to the two at-large seats.
