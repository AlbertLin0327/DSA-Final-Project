Space tourism is space travel for recreational, leisure or business purposes. A number of startup companies have sprung up in recent years, hoping to create a space tourism industry. Orbital space tourism opportunities have been limited and expensive, with only the Russian Space Agency providing transport to date. The publicized price for flights brokered by Space Adventures to the International Space Station aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft have been US$ 2035 million, during the period 20012009. Some space tourists have signed contracts with third parties to conduct certain research activities while in orbit. Russia halted orbital space tourism in 2010 due to the increase in the International Space Station crew size, using the seats for expedition crews that would be sold to paying spaceflight participants. However, tourist flights are tentatively planned to resume in 2013, when the number of single-use three-person Soyuz launches could rise to five a year.[1][2][3][4] As an alternative term to "tourism", some organizations such as the Commercial Spaceflight Federation use the term "personal spaceflight." Citizens in Space uses the term "citizen space exploration."[5] After early successes in space, much of the public saw intensive space exploration as inevitable. Those aspirations are remembered in science fiction such as ArthurC. Clarke's AFall of Moondust and 2001: A Space Odyssey, Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, Joanna Russ's 1968 novel Picnic on Paradise, and Larry Niven's Known Space stories. Lucian in the 2nd century AD in his book True History examines the idea of a crew of men whose ship travels to the Moon during a storm. Jules Verne also took up the theme of lunar visits in his books, From the Earth to the Moon and Around the Moon. RobertA. Heinleins short story The Menace from Earth, published in 1957, was one of the first to incorporate elements of a developed space tourism industry within its framework. During the 1960s and 1970s, it was common belief that space hotels would be launched by 2000. Many futurologists around the middle of the 20th century speculated that the average family of the early 21st century would be able to enjoy a holiday on the Moon. In the 1960s, Pan Am established a waiting list for future flights to the Moon,[6] issuing free "First Moon Flights Club" membership cards to those who requested them. The end of the Space Race, culminating in the Moon landings, decreased the emphasis placed on space exploration by national governments and therefore led to decreased demands for public funding of manned space flights.[7] The Soviet space program was aggressive in broadening the pool of cosmonauts. The Soviet Intercosmos program included cosmonauts selected from Warsaw Pact members (from Czechoslovakia, Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania) and later from allies of the USSR (Cuba, Mongolia, Vietnam) and non-aligned countries (India, Syria, Afghanistan). Most of these cosmonauts received full training for their missions and were treated as equals, but especially after the Mir program began, were generally given shorter flights than Soviet cosmonauts. The European Space Agency (ESA) took advantage of the program as well. The U.S. space shuttle program included payload specialist positions which were usually filled by representatives of companies or institutions managing a specific payload on that mission. These payload specialists did not receive the same training as professional NASA astronauts and were not employed by NASA. In 1983, Ulf Merbold from ESA and Byron Lichtenberg from MIT (engineer and Air Force fighter pilot) were the first Payload Specialists to fly on the Space Shuttle, becoming the first non-NASA astronauts. In 1984, Charlie Walker became the first non-government astronaut to fly, with his employer McDonnell Douglas paying $40,000 for his flight.[8]:7475 NASA was also eager to prove its capability to Congressional sponsors. Senator Jake Garn was flown on the shuttle in 1985, followed by Representative Bill Nelson (now Senator) in 1986. During the 1970s, shuttle prime contractor Rockwell International studied a $200300 million removable cabin that could fit into the shuttle's cargo bay. The cabin could carry up to 74 passengers into orbit for up to three days. A 1985 presentation to the National Space Society stated that although flying tourists in the cabin would cost $1 to 1.5 million per passenger without government subsidy, within 15 years 30,000 people a year would pay $25,000 each to fly in space on new spacecraft. The presentation also forecast flights to lunar orbit within 30 years and visits to the lunar surface within 50 years.[9] As the shuttle program expanded in the early 1980s, NASA began a Space Flight Participant program to allow citizens without scientific or governmental roles to fly. Christa McAuliffe was chosen as the first Teacher in Space in July 1985 from 11,400 applicants. 1,700 applied for the Journalist in Space program, including Walter Cronkite, Tom Brokaw, Tom Wolfe, and Sam Donaldson. An Artist in Space program was considered, and NASA expected that after McAuliffe's flight two to three civilians a year would fly on the shuttle.[8] After McAuliffe was killed in the Challenger disaster in January 1986 the programs were canceled. McAuliffe's backup, Barbara Morgan, eventually got hired in 1998 as a professional astronaut and flew on STS-118 as a mission specialist.[8]:8485 A second journalist-in-space program, in which NASA green-lighted Miles O'Brien to fly on the space shuttle, was scheduled to be announced in 2003. That program was canceled in the wake of the Columbia accident on STS-107 and subsequent emphasis on finishing the International Space Station before retiring the space shuttle. With the realities of the post-Perestroika economy in Russia, its space industry was especially starved for cash. The Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) offered to pay for one of its reporters to fly on a mission. For $28 million, Toyohiro Akiyama was flown in 1990 to Mir with the eighth crew and returned a week later with the seventh crew. Akiyama gave a daily TV broadcast from orbit and also performed scientific experiments for Russian and Japanese companies. However, since the cost of the flight was paid by his employer, Akiyama could be considered a business traveler rather than a tourist. In 1991, British chemist Helen Sharman was selected from a pool of 13,000 applicants to be the first Briton in space.[10] The program was known as Project Juno and was a cooperative arrangement between the Soviet Union and a group of British companies. The Project Juno consortium failed to raise the funds required, and the program was almost cancelled. Reportedly Mikhail Gorbachev ordered it to proceed under Soviet expense in the interests of international relations, but in the absence of Western underwriting, less expensive experiments were substituted for those in the original plans. Sharman flew aboard Soyuz TM-12 to Mir and returned aboard Soyuz TM-11. At the end of the 1990s, MirCorp, a private venture by then in charge of the space station, began seeking potential space tourists to visit Mir in order to offset some of its maintenance costs. Dennis Tito, an American businessman and former JPL scientist, became their first candidate. When the decision to de-orbit Mir was made, Tito managed to switch his trip to the International Space Station through a deal between MirCorp and U.S.-based Space Adventures, Ltd., despite strong opposition from senior figures at NASA. From the beginning of the International Space Station expeditions, NASA stated it wasn't interested in space guests.[11] Space Adventures remains the only company to have sent paying passengers to space.[12][13] In conjunction with the Federal Space Agency of the Russian Federation and Rocket and Space Corporation (Energia), Space Adventures facilitated the flights for all of the world's first private space explorers. The first three participants paid in excess of $20 million (USD) each for their 10-day visit to the ISS. On April 28, 2001, Dennis Tito became the first "fee-paying" space tourist when he visited the International Space Station (ISS) for seven days. He was followed in 2002 by South African computer millionaire Mark Shuttleworth. The third was Gregory Olsen in 2005, who was trained as a scientist and whose company produced specialist high-sensitivity cameras. Olsen planned to use his time on the ISS to conduct a number of experiments, in part to test his company's products. Olsen had planned an earlier flight, but had to cancel for health reasons. After the Columbia disaster, space tourism on the Russian Soyuz program was temporarily put on hold, because Soyuz vehicles became the only available transport to the ISS. On July 26, 2005, Space Shuttle Discovery (mission STS-114) marked the shuttle's return to space. Consequently, in 2006, space tourism was resumed. On September 18, 2006, Anousheh Ansari, an Iranian American (Soyuz TMA-9), became the fourth space tourist (she prefers "private space explorer".[14]). On April 7, 2007, Charles Simonyi, an American businessman of Hungarian descent, joined their ranks (Soyuz TMA-10). Simonyi became the first repeat space tourist, paying again to fly on Soyuz TMA-14 in MarchApril 2009. Canadian Guy Lalibert became the next space tourist in September, 2009 aboard Soyuz TMA-16. In 2003, NASA and the Russian Space Agency agreed to use the term 'Spaceflight Participant' to distinguish those space travelers from astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies. Tito, Shuttleworth, Olsen, Ansari, and Simonyi were designated as such during their respective space flights.[15] NASA also lists Christa McAuliffe as a "Space Flight Participant" (although she did not pay a fee), apparently due to her non-technical duties aboard the STS-51-L flight. As reported by Reuters on March 3, 2010, Russia announced that the country will double the number of launches of three-man Soyuz ships to four that year, because "permanent crews of professional astronauts aboard the expanded [ISS] station are set to rise to six"; regarding space tourism, the head of the Russian Cosmonauts' Training Center said "for some time there will be a break in these journeys".[1] On January 12, 2011, Space Adventures and the Russian Federal Space Agency announced that orbital space tourism would resume in 2013 with the increase of manned Soyuz launches to the ISS from four to five per year.[16] Seven of the space tourists flew to and from the International Space Station on Soyuz spacecraft through the space tourism company Space Adventures:[17] No suborbital space tourism has occurred yet, but since it is projected to be more affordable, it is viewed as a money-making proposition by several companies, including RocketShip Tours, Space Adventures, Virgin Galactic, Starchaser, Blue Origin, Armadillo Aerospace, XCOR Aerospace, the European "Project Enterprise",[27] Thirsty Swagman[28] and others  for example, in 1966 Robert Truax founded first unreleased company Truax Engineering, Inc. and the new projects of non-profit rocketgroups Romanian ARCASPACE since 1999, Danish Copenhagen Suborbitals since 2008). Most are proposing vehicles that make suborbital flights peaking at an altitude of 100160 kilometres.[29] Passengers would experience three to six minutes of weightlessness, a view of a twinkle-free starfield, and a vista of the curved Earth below. Projected costs are expected to be about $200,000 per passenger.[30][31][32][33][34] As of March 2010 Virgin Galactic had pre-sold nearly 410 seats for their suborbital space tourism flights, according to the company's website.[35] On October 4, 2004, the SpaceShipOne, designed by Burt Rutan of Scaled Composites, won the $10,000,000 X Prize, which was designed to be won by the first private company who could reach and surpass an altitude of 62 miles (100km) twice within two weeks. The altitude is beyond the Krmn Line, the arbitrarily defined boundary of space.[36] The first flight was flown by Michael Melvill on June 21, 2004 to a height of 62miles, making him the first commercial astronaut.[37] The prize-winning flight was flown by Brian Binnie, which reached a height of 69.6miles, breaking the X-15 record.[36] Virgin Galactic, one of the leading potential space tourism groups, is planning to begin passenger service aboard the VSS Enterprise, a Scaled Composites SpaceShipTwo type spacecraft. The initial seat price is $200,000, with a required down-payment of $20,000.[35] To date, over 500 [38] people have signed up. Headed by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group, Virgin Galactic hopes to be the first private space tourism company to regularly send civilians into space. A citizen astronaut will only require three days of training before spaceflight. SpaceShipTwo is a scaled up version of SpaceShipOne, the spacecraft which claimed the Ansari X Prize. Both spacecraft were designed by Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites. Launches will initially occur at the Mojave Spaceport in California, and will then be moved to Spaceport America in Upham, New Mexico. Tourists will also be flown from Kiruna, Sweden[39] The spacecraft will travel 360,000feet (109.73km/68.18miles) high. This goes beyond the internationally defined boundary between Earth and space of 100km. Spaceflights will last 2.5 hours, carry 6 passengers, and reach a speed of Mach 3. SpaceShipTwo will not require a space shuttle-like heat shield for atmospheric reentry as it will not experience the extreme aerodynamic heating experienced during reentry at orbital velocities (approximately Mach 22.5 at a typical shuttle altitude of 300km, or 185miles).[40] The glider will employ a "feathering" technique to manage drag during the unpowered descent and landing. SpaceShipTwo will use a single hybrid rocket motor to launch from mid-air after detaching from a mother ship at 50,000feet, instead of NASA's space shuttle's ground-based launch. XCOR Aerospace is developing a suborbital vehicle called Lynx.[41] The Lynx will take off from a runway under rocket power. Unlike Burt Rutan's SpaceShip One and Virgin Galactic's SpaceShip Two, Lynx will not require a mothership. Lynx is designed for rapid turnaround, which will enable it to fly up to four times per day. Because of this rapid flight rate, Lynx has fewer seats than SpaceShip Two, carrying only one pilot and one spaceflight participant on each flight. XCOR expects to roll out the first Lynx prototype during the summer of 2012 and begin flight tests by late 2012. If all goes well, Lynx could be carrying paying customers before the end of 2013. Armadillo Aerospace is developing a two-seat vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) rocket called Hyperion, which will be marketed by Space Adventures. Hyperion uses a capsule similar in shape to the Gemini capsule. The vehicle will use a parachute for descent but will probably use retrorockets for final touchdown, according to remarks made by Armadillo Aerospace at the Next Generation Suborbital Researchers Conference in February 2012. Project Enterprise was launched by the German TALIS Institute in 2004 and is the first project of its kind in Europe.[42] The goal is to develop a rocket-propelled spaceplane by 2011 that will carry one pilot and up to five passengers into suborbital space. The plane will launch from the ground using rockets, and will return in an unpowered flight like Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo. The prototypes and finished spaceplane will be launched from an airport near Cochstedt (Germany; Saxony-Anhalt). Since 2004, the TALIS Institute has gained many industrial partners, including XtremeAir,[43] who will manufacture the airframe, and Swiss Propulsion Laboratory SPL,[44] who will deliver the propulsion components. XtremeAir is known for their acrobatic airplanes, and SPL has designed and tested liquid propellant rocket engines since 1998. Current work is focusing on the first prototype, the "Black Sky": An existing acrobatic airplane that would be fitted with a single rocket engine and a new wing. The rocket engine is expected to deliver a thrust of 10 kN. The test program for this engine started in 2007 at SPL and is expected to fly by 2010.[45][46] Citizens in Space, formerly Teachers in Space, is a project of the United States Rocket Academy. Citizens in Space combines citizen science with citizen space exploration. The goal is to fly citizen-science experiments and citizen explorers who will act as payload operators on suborbital space missions. Citizens in Space has already acquired a contract for 10 suborbital flights with XCOR Aerospace and expects to acquire additional flights from XCOR and other suborbital spaceflight providers in the future. Citizens in Space has begun training three citizen astronaut candidates and will select additional candidates in the near future.[47] In December 2005, the U.S. Government released a set of proposed rules for space tourism.[48] These included screening procedures and training for emergency situations, but not health requirements. Under current US law, any company proposing to launch paying passengers from American soil on a suborbital rocket must receive a license from the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (FAA/AST). The licensing process focuses on public safety and safety of property, and the details can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Chapter III.[49] This is in accordance with the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act passed by Congress in 2004.[50] According to a report funded by NASA and The Aerospace Corporation, soot emitted by rockets[quantify] in the upper atmosphere would lead to significant disruption[quantify] of the world's climatic system hence resulting in a net increase in temperature. Also, the ozone layer would be affected with equatorial regions losing about one per cent of ozone cover and poles gaining about 10 per cent.[51] No reason has been cited for the Wikify tag on this article.You can insert a reason using the |reason= parameter, like this: {{Wikify|reason=Your reason here}} Fashion designer Eri Matsui has designed clothing, including a wedding gown, intended to look best in weightless environments.[citation needed] Several organizations have been formed to promote the space tourism industry, including the Space Tourism Society and others.[52][53][54] More information about the future of Space Tourism can be found at Space Tourism Lecture, which is a free online Space Tourism Lecture handout collection. Dr. Clinton J. Wallington taught the first course in Space Tourism Development, at Rochester Institute of Technology, beginning in 1999.[55] Since 2003 Dr. Robert A. Goehlich has taught a Space Tourism class at Keio University, Yokohama, Japan. Space Tourism Syllabus UniGalactic Space Travel Magazine is a bi-monthly educational publication covering space tourism and space exploration developments in companies like SpaceX, Orbital Sciences, Virgin Galactic and organizations like NASA. The content of UniGalactic Space Travel Magazine can be found on UniGalactic web site. A web-based survey suggested that over 70% of those surveyed wanted less than or equal to 2 weeks in space; in addition, 88% wanted to spacewalk (only 14% of these would do it for a 50% premium), and 21% wanted a hotel or space station.[56] The concept has met with some criticism from politicians, notably Gnter Verheugen, vice-president of the European Commission, who said of the EADS Astrium Space Tourism Project "It's only for the super rich, which is against my social convictions".[57] Dennis Tito, Mark Shuttleworth, Gregory Olsen, Anousheh Ansari and Richard Garriott have all expressed a preference to be called something other than "space tourist". In each case, they explained their preferences by pointing out that they carried out scientific experiments as part of their journey; Garriott additionally emphasized their training is identical to requirements of non-Russian Soyuz crew members, and that teachers and other non-professional astronauts chosen to fly with NASA are called astronauts.[58] Garriott prefers "cosmonaut" or "astronaut", but will accept "private" in front of either. Tito has asked to be known as an "independent researcher".[citation needed] Shuttleworth proposed "pioneer of commercial space travel".[59] Olsen preferred "private researcher."[60] Ansari prefers the term "private space explorer".[14] Alone among those who have paid to go to orbit so far, Charles Simonyi seems to have no concerns about calling it "space tourism", even in reference to his own experience. Asked in an interview "Do you foresee a day when space tourism is not just the province of billionaires  when it will be as affordable as plane travel?", he did not object to the implicit categorization of his own trip, but rather answered "Yes, the only question is when ...."[61] NASA and the Russian Federal Space Agency agreed to use the term "spaceflight participant" to distinguish those space travelers from astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies. Although many space enthusiasts subscribe to the notion of space tourism as a potential burgeoning industry that could further the development and settlement of space, some of these same enthusiasts object to the use of the term "space tourist". Rick Tumlinson of the Space Frontier Foundation, for example, has said Others with perhaps less enthusiasm for space development seem to agree. Alex Tabarrok has categorized it as a kind of "space adventure travel". The mere fact of people paying for a travel experience does not, in his view, make that activity "tourism". Brian Binnie, and Mike Melvill, the pilots of Scaled Composites Space Ship One were awarded the title of Commercial Astronaut by the United States Federal Aviation Administration. This is a new classification that distinguishes the holder as an astronaut, but is not associated with the United States NASA space program. In a 2010 FAA report title The Economic Impact of Commercial Space Transportation on the U. S Economy in 2009, the FAA cites studies done by Futron an aerospace and technology-consulting firm; which, predict that space tourism could become a billion-dollar market within 20 years.[64] In addition, in the decade since Dennis Tito journeyed to the International Space Station on April 28, 2001, eight private citizens have paid the $20 million dollar fee to travel to space. Space Adventures suggests that this number will increased to 15 by 2020.[65] These figures do not include other private space agencies such as Virgin Galactic, which as of 2012 has sold 500 tickets worth $200,000 dollars each. Its ticket sales are expected to increase by the year 2013, when Virgin Galactic expects to begin flights.[66]
