The Boston Aquarial Gardens (1859-1860) was a public aquarium in Boston, Massachusetts, established by James Ambrose Cutting and Henry D Butler. The "conservatories [were] filled with rare marine animals imported and collected exclusively for this establishment; ... a perfect and striking illustration of life beneath the waters."[1] The business was located on Bromfield Street in the Financial District. In 1860 it moved to a new facility nearby, on Central Court, off Washington Street, and re-opened as the Boston Aquarial and Zoological Gardens.[2] Advertisement, 1859 "Catalogue of fishes, mollusca, zoophytes, &c. ...
