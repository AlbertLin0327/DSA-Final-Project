The Zuckerhtl is a mountain in Tyrol, Austria. At 3,505 metres (11,499 feet), it is the highest peak of the Stubai Alps and at the southern end of the Stubaital. It derives its name, meaning sugarloaf in English, from its conical shape - like a sugarloaf. Its east side is snowy and its west side more rocky. In nearby Italy it is known as Pan di Zcchero, also meaning 'sugarloaf'.
