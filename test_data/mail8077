Content:
Isoflavonoids are a class of flavonoid phenolic compounds. They are biologically active compounds, such as phytoestrogens, produced by pea family plants. Isoflavonoids are derived from the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway via liquiritigenin or naringenin.[1] Pterocarpans are derived from isoflavonoids.[2] While flavonoids (in the narrow sense) have the 2-phenylchromen-4-one backbone, isoflavonoids have the 3-phenylchromen-4-one backbone (Number 574-12-9, chemical formula C15H10O2, exact mass: 222.0680792) with no hydroxyl group substitution at position 2 (case of the isoflavones) or the 3-phenylchroman (isoflavan, CAS number: 4737-26-2) backbone (case of isoflavanes, e.g.: equol).
