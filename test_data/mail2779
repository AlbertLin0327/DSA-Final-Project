Osman Nuri Koptagel (1874; Erzincan  November 22, 1942; Ankara) was an officer of the Ottoman Army and the general of the Turkish Army. When he was an assistant teaching staff of the Ottoman Military Academy, he used to order "Sadan birinci manga, kop ta gel!"[2] ("First squad from the right, separate (from line) and come!"), "Birinci mangadan sadan itibaren be kii kop da gel!"[3] ("First squad of five person from the right, separate (from line) and come!"). His students gave him a nickname "Kop ta gel". After the 1934 Surname Law, Mustafa Kemal gave him a surname "Koptagel".
