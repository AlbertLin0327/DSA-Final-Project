Dead End Glacier (5447S 3556W / 54.783S 35.933W / -54.783; -35.933Coordinates: 5447S 3556W / 54.783S 35.933W / -54.783; -35.933) is a glacier flowing east from the south end of the Salvesen Range of South Georgia into the west side of Salomon Glacier. It was surveyed by the South Georgia Survey in the period 195157, and so named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee because there is no route for sledging parties from the head of this glacier to the north shore of Drygalski Fjord.
