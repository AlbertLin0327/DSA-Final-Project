Sal Alosi (born May 11, 1977, in Massapequa, New York) is the former head strength and conditioning coach for the New York Jets. On December 13, 2010, he was fined $25,000 by the Jets and suspended for the remainder of the season for tripping Miami Dolphins player Nolan Carroll as the latter ran along the sideline. Two days later, the Jets suspended him indefinitely after it was discovered that he had instructed inactive Jets players to line up along the sideline so as to potentially impede opposing players. General manager Mike Tannenbaum said that Alosi had initially not been truthful about how the wall had been formed.[1] The NFL subsequently fined the Jets $100,000 for Alosi's actions.[2] Alosi was a linebacker at Hofstra University from 1996 to 2000. As a senior, he was named the co-recipient of the Mayors Trophy, an annual award presented to the two Hofstra players who best exemplify good sportsmanship and fair play both on and off the field.[3] He won the award in 2000, despite having been arrested the year before for allegedly breaking into a dorm room with seven teammates and assaulting three students.[4] Originally charged with third-degree assault, he later pled guilty to a lesser charge of second-degree harassment, a misdemeanor.[5] He became a coach for Hofstra in 2001, then moved on to the Jets in 2002. In 2006, he joined the coaching staff of the Atlanta Falcons, but went back to the Jets the following year.[6] Sal Alosi resigned from the Jets on January 31, 2011. [7] Alosi has officially taken over the head strength coach job at Bryant University in Smithfield, Rhode Island. He will primarily work with the lacrosse and football teams. Alosi's brother Pete is an assistant strength and conditioning coach with the Arizona Cardinals.[8] On January 10, 2012, Alosi was hired as the UCLA Bruins strength and conditioning coordinator by head coach, Jim Mora.
