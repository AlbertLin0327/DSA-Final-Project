Public Insight Journalism is a pioneering approach to journalism created by American Public Media. It recognizes that broadcast media today operate in a changed media environment, and need to expand the resources available to journalists when deciding what is news and reporting on that news, as well as be responsive to audience desires to participate. Through a collection of tools, many of them web-based, MPR News solicits knowledge and direct experience from people in its Public Insight Network. The basic goal is to do better journalism through increased public input. Public Insight Journalism contributes to the national shows Marketplace (radio program) and Weekend America, and is being rolled out on a limited basis to other public radio stations in the U.S. The MPR radio show In the Loop is directly associated with PIJ (the acronym by which is sometimes known). In late 2006, Public Insight Journalism became the core of a new MPR initiative called the Center for Innovation in Journalism.
