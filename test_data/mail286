The Choral Public Domain Library (CPDL) is a sheet music archive which focuses on choral and vocal music in the public domain or otherwise freely available for printing and performing (such as via permission from the copyright holder). The site CPDL.org was launched in December 1998 by Rafael Ornes.[1] In 2005 CPDL was ported, or converted, to wiki format, and is now accessible at ChoralWiki or via [1]. In July 2008, Ornes stepped back from the site administration and turned the operational responsibilities to a group of the site administrators. A transition committee was formed which subsequently incorporated CPDL as a non-profit under California state and now operates CPDL. In addition to making sheet music scores available, the wiki format supports additional features including: Music is available for free download in a variety of formats, including score images in PDF, PS and TIFF format, sound files in MIDI and MP3 formats, and in the notation formats supported by various notation programs, including Finale, Finale Allegro, Finale PrintMusic, and Finale Notepad by MakeMusic, Sibelius, by Sibelius, Noteworthy composer, Encore, and the open source GNU LilyPond. Most scores on CPDL are distributed under an open-source license. As of May 15, 2011 CPDL archives over 12,750 scores by more than 1800 composers, contributed by over 750 editors and contributors. It includes large numbers of scores from the Renaissance and Baroque eras, including nearly complete vocal works by William Byrd and Toms Luis de Victoria in excellent editions. CPDL is suggested as a resource by departmental or faculty websites at Kent State University, Northern Illinois University, the University of Oregon, the University of Western Ontario, the Internet Public Library of the University of Michigan, the University at Albany, The State University of New York, by the UCLA Music Library, by the libraries at the Universities of Boston[2] and Stanford and by inclusion by faculty members in syllabi for courses at the University of WisconsinOshkosh.[3] It is recommended by the Iowa and Massachusetts chapters of the American Choral Directors Association, and is included in the resource database of Intute, an association of Institutions in the UK.[4]
