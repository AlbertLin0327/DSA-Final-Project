The SMC Pentax-DA 40mm f/2.8 Limited lens is a pancake lens for the Pentax K mount. At only 0.6 in (15 mm) long, it was the smallest lens made by Pentax until the 40mm XS lens was introduced. The lens has a 35mm equivalent focal length of 60mm; it is part of the Limited series of high-performance compact prime lenses. The SMC Pentax-DA 40mm f/2.8 XS is an even thinner version of the DA 40mm lens, at 0.36 inches thick. It features an aesthetic design by Marc Newson[1] to match the Pentax K-01.
