By 2020, China should stand among the world's top 10 countries in terms of international competitiveness. -By 2020, the population of extremely poor people should be reduced by 50 percent, primary and middle school education should be made public, as should high school and higher education. Mortality rates of children and pregnant women should be reduced by two thirds and three fourths respectively, AIDS and other infectious diseases should be brought under control, and the primary health care and social security system should cover the rural population. -More than 85 percent of the people should be covered by urban unemployment, medical insurance, and basic endowment insurance programs. The incidence of labor disputes, criminal cases, and public security cases should be controlled within five per thousand, six per thousand, and about eight per thousand, respectively. - The Asian integration process should be guided. The status of national separation should be concluded and national reunification should be realized. The disputes over territories and territorial waters with neighboring countries should be resolved in a peaceful manner. China should stand in the front rank of the world in terms of military strength, enhance its defense and combat capabilities, and set up a wartime-peacetime joint logistics support system for the three armed forces with participation by servicemen and civilians. -China should constantly enhance its sustainable development capabilities.

Safety nets should be set up to prevent and protect from various kinds of disasters. A mechanism should be set up to deal with various emergencies. An urgent aid system should be established.
