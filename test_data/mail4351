Kevin (Irish: Caoimhn /qi:i:n/, Middle Irish: Caoimhghn /qijin/, Old Irish: Cemgein /qoijin/, Latinised form: Coemgenus) is a male first name of Irish origin. It is believed that Saint Kevin was the one who popularized the name, although Kevin is not a biblical name. Caoimhghn derives from the Irish caomh (Old Irish cem) "kind, honest, handsome" and -gin (Old Irish gein) "birth". Kevin is unrelated to the names Kelvin or Calvin. "Kevin" is one of the top 100 male baby names in Canada, Chile, France, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United States.[1] It can also be spelled Kevyn, Keven, Kevan, or Kvin. In the United Kingdom, its popularity peaked during the 1950s and 1960s, when it was frequently among the 20 most popular male first names, but by the 1990s it had fallen out of the top 100.[2] The female version of Caoimhn (Kevin) is Caoimhe (anglicised as Kiva or Keva).
