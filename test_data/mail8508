Eid is a municipality in the county of Sogn og Fjordane, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Nordfjord. The village of Nordfjordeid is the administrative center of the municipality. Other larger villages are Mogrenda, Strheim, Haugen, Kjlsdalen, Heggjabygda, and Lote Eid is known for its opera, fjord horses, shopping, and hiking opportunities. As in the rest of the region, agriculture is very important here, but trade and industry are also important. Frislid Konfeksjon (textiles) and the Hellesy Nordfjord shipyard among others are located in Eid. Nordfjordeid has much to offer in the way of education. Its schools include the folk high school, which offers courses linked to Fjord horses and provides the only circus education in Norway. There is also the Norwegian Fjord Horse Centre (Norsk Fjordhestsenter) in Eid. Its focus is in boosting the breed's standing in Norway and elsewhere.[2] Eid was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The original municipality was identical to the Eid parish (prestegjeld) with the sub-parishes (sokn) of Hornindal, Eid, and Strheim.[3] On 1 January 1867, Hornindal was separated from Eid to form its own municipality. This split left the two remaining sub-parishes of the municipality of Eid with a population of 2,918.[4] On 1 January 1965, the neighboring municipalities of Davik and Hornindal were dissolved and split up among their neighbors. Eid gained all of Davik that was north of the Nordfjord and east of and including the village of Lefdal. (Population in that area was 654.[4]) All of Hornindal west of and including the villages of Navelsaker and Holmyvik (population: 310) was also merged into Eid. After this merger, Eid's total population was 4,532.[4] At this point, Eid gained a third sub-parish from the former municipality of Davik: Kjlsdalen. Then on 1 January 1992, the village of Lote (population: 152) was transferred from the municipality of Gloppen to Eid.[4] The Old Norse form of the name was ygir; this was originally the name of a fjord (now called the Eidsfjord). The name of the fjord is probably derived from a river name Aug, and this again is derived from the word fugr which means "backwards". The actual river (now called Eidselva) meanders back and forth and from certain points it can seem to run backwards. The coat of arms were granted on 26 April 1986. The arms show the head of a fjord horse. The region is well known for its own race of horses, called the Fjording, that are very common and popular in the area. The Fjording is characterised by its white and black mane.[5] (See also the coat of arms for Gloppen, Levanger, Lyngen, Nord-Fron, Skedsmo and Ski.) The Church of Norway has four churches within the parish of Eid. It is part of the Diocese of Bjrgvin and the Rural Deanery (Prosti) of Nordfjord.[3][6] All municipalities in Norway, including Eid, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elect a mayor. The municipal council (Kommunestyre) of Eid is made up of 29 representatives that are elected to every four years. For 2007-2011, the party breakdown is as follows:[7]   The mayor (ordfrar) of a municipality in Norway is a representative of the majority party of the municipal council who is elected to lead the council. Sonja Edvardsen of the Labor Party (Det Norske Arbeiderpartiet) was elected mayor for the 2007-2011 term.[8] Eid is located in the northernmost part of Sogn og Fjordane county. It is located along the northern shores of the Nordfjord and it surrounds the Eidsfjord. Eid is bordered to the west by the municipality of Vgsy, to the south by Bremanger and Gloppen, to the east by Stryn and Hornindal, and to the north by Volda and Vanylven in Mre og Romsdal county. Hornindalsvatnet, the deepest lake in Europe, is located there.
