Standard Drug Company (originally founded as Hopkins and Bethea) is a historic pharmaceutical company in Meridian, Mississippi. Originally established as a small retail drug store in 1900, the company was incorporated in 1919 and became one of the largest commercial firms in the city. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Standard Drug Company was originally named "Hopkins and Bethea" after W.E. Hopkins and Oscar Bethea, who founded the company in 1900 on 22nd Avenue. The company moved to a three story building at 2408 5th Street.[2] That building was included as a contributing property to the Meridian Urban Center Historic District in 1979, known as the "Hopkins and Bethea Building".[3][4] The building had been demolished by the time the Meridian Downtown Historic District (which combined two smaller districts in Meridian, one of which was Urban Center) was listed in 2007.[5] As the city grew, so did Hopkins and Bethea. The business was incorporated in 1911, with W.E. Hopkins as president, and the name was changed to Standard Drug Company. By 1919, the company was large enough to warrant a new building. The Meridian Medical College property at 25th Avenue and 6th Street was purchased and demolished, making way for a new three-story building with over 67,300 square feet (6,250m2) of floor space. The company would remain in this building until 1977 when it was sold to Durr-Fillauer Medical out of Montgomery, Alabama.[2] The building at 601 25th Avenue, built in 1919, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.[1] The building has a utilitarian design, simple and rectangular, a style common to commercial and industrial buildings of its construction era. The southeast corner of the building, which faces the intersection of 6th Street and 25th Avenue, is constructed of yellow-brown brick with a decorative cornice while the "rear" (north and west sides) of the building is constructed of lower grade red brick. A parking lot is located on the rear side. One loading dock is located on the south side of the building, and another (added in the 1970s) is located on the northeast side of the building.[2] The first floor contains three rooms, and all of the walls are stuccoed. From east to west, the rooms were used for office space and product display, shipping and receiving, and storage. The office room was originally floored with linoleum, although carpet was added later. The room was originally only split into two areas, the office area having a pressed tin ceiling, but a vault was added in the 1920s, and a private office was partitioned off in 1941. A computer room was later built in the southeast corner. The shipping and receiving room contains an elevator in the center of the room which leads to the upper floors. Loading docks are located on either side of the room. The storage room is empty except for staircases leading to the upper floors.[2] The second floor was only partitioned into two rooms. Milk of magnesia, iodine, merthiolate, mercurochrome, and other drugs were manufactured in the east room while the west room was used mainly for storage. A small corner of the west room was known as the "acid room"; the floor was covered with sand to prevent damage. The third floor was primarily used for storage.[2]
