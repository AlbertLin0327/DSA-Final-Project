Irregular menstruation (or irregular cycles/periods) is an abnormal variation in length of menstrual cycles in a woman. Normally, it is actually unusual for a woman to experience cycle length variations of less than four days between the shortest and longest cycle lengths.[1] However, length variation between eight and 20 days is considered as moderately irregular cycles.[1] Variation of 21 days or more is considered very irregular.[1] Alternatively, an irregular menstruation period may be defined as one shorter than 21 days, or longer than 36 days.[2] The term metrorrhagia is often used for irregular menstruation that occurs between the expected menstrual periods.[3] Oligomenorrhea is infrequent or very light menstruation,[4] Also, menstrual periods should have been regularly established previously before the development of infrequent flow.[4] and often (but not always) involves irregular intervals.
