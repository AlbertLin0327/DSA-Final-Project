Negroamaro, also Negro amaro, is a red wine grape variety native to southern Italy. It is grown almost exclusively in Puglia and particularly in Salento, the peninsula which can be visualised as the heel of Italy. The grape can produce wines very deep in color. Wines made from Negroamaro tend to be very rustic in character, combining perfume with an earthy bitterness. The grape produces some of the best red wines of Puglia, particularly when blended with the highly scented Malvasia Nera, as in the case of Salice Salentino. Although amaro is the Italian for bitter, the name is thought to derive from two words meaning black: the Latin language negro and the ancient Greek maru.[1] 'Maru' shares a root with "merum", a wine brought to Puglia by Illyrian colonists before the Greeks arrived in the 7th century BC. Horace and other Roman writers mention "mera tarantina" from Taranto, and Pliny the Elder describes Manduria as 'viticulosa' (full of vineyards). But after the fall of the Roman Empire winemaking declined until it was only kept alive in the monasteries - Benedictine on Murgia and Greek Orthodox in Salento. Negroamaro could be the grape used in merum, or it could have been brought by traders from the home of winemaking in Asia Minor at any point in the last 8000 years. Negroamaro precoce has recently been identified as a distinct clone. RAPD analysis suggests that it is loosely related to Verdicchio (Verdeca) and Sangiovese.[2] The grapes are used exclusively for wine-making. Although 100% varietal wines are produced, Negroamaro is more commonly used as the dominant component of a blend including such varieties as Malvasia Nera, Sangiovese or Montepulciano. These wines are red, or sometimes rosato, and are usually still; though both red and rosato versions may be frizzante.

It is well suited to Puglias hot summers and exhibits good drought-resistance. The grapes, carried in bunches of around 300350 g, are oval in form, medium-large in size with thick skins, and black-violet in colour. They ripen mid-season (late Septemberearly October). The first American producer of Negroamaro is Chiarito Vineyards in Ukiah, California (Mendocino County).
