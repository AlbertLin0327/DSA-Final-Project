The Ramoshi (alternately Berad) is an Indian community found largely in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Karnataka, and are historically associated with great empires,important historical conflicts and agriculture. They are also described as the Bedar or fearless ,nicknamed for their braveness by the Mughals. The term Ramoshi or as British called it ramoossy.The earlier occupation of the Ramoshi was as a Warrior fighting battles for the Maratha kings as Infantry and leading the troops,It also denotes the leader of a group or head of a territory.[1] They recognize the varna system and belong to the kshatriya class. They are Hindu and belong to the Lingayat sect while some are Vaishanavas [2] According to the Rajguru of the Sholapur princely state, Bedars or Boyas come from Tamil Nadu, having migrated to Karnataka during Vijaynagar rule. Names of 14 ancestors are known to him but not their locations. The last was 'Goshti Pid Nayaka', a contemporary of Shivaji Maharaj. This means that the history dates back to 800 years from Shivaji's known date of 1630 AD. Epigraphs from the 8th to 11th centuries mention 'Boya - Bedar', as they were from the Hunter - warrior community who were called as 'Nayaks'. During Vijaynagar rule, these Nayak kings were assigned the duty of protecting the province of Tungabhadra. After the fall of Vijaynagar, the kings of Sholapur became independent and only came under Bijapur court in name. The Bijapur court was always afraid of Beda Nayak Kings. Later, during the Maratha - Moghul conflict, Nayak kings played an important role. After the fall of Sambhaji and migration of Rajaram to Gingee, the Moghul-Maratha conflict spread from Narmada to Tamil Nadu and from the east to the west coast. Moghul Emperors realized that they were fighting with a hurt identity in 1695, but it was not possible for them to turn back. During this conflict, Bedar Nayaks also played an important role, as the families of all important Maratha Sardars and their treasury was in Vagana-gera (or Wakin-kheda), the capital of these Nayak kings. Therefore, King Aurangzeb had to fight the last battle of his life against Bedar Nayaks of Vagana-gera during 1705 and 1706. Today's Ramoshi in Maharashtra was earlier called the Boya, Bedar and Vedan. ([4]). Ramoshis of Maharashtra have come from mostly Karnataka and their surnames are the same as Bedar-Ramoshi of Karnataka. Their original language is southern and they first got settled in Karnataka, later migrating to Maharashtra. The word 'Bhuyal' in the Bedar language seems to have originated from Boya. The Nayaka kings in the karnataka were the ancestors of the modern day Berads and other subclasses which fall under the Boyar main class.[3]  The modern town of Sagar is situated in the Shimoga district of Karnataka, between the Krishna and Bhima Rivers. The region between these rivers is hilly and forested and is called Malnad on account of the heavy rainfall it receives. In the middle ages there was no town, the forests were thicker, and the wildlife profuse. From Mysore north through the Malnad region and all the way to Bijapur were lands colonized by the Beradsa race of aboriginal Kanarese belonging to the lowest Dhed caste on account of their life style. Although many of them were Lingayets or Vaishnavs they had no dietary restrictions and ate mutton, beef, pork, and fowl with gusto and drank to excess. Their race name means hunter in Kanarese and they also indulged in cattle-lifting and other crimes. Alternatively called Bedars/Beydurs these people were dark, muscular, and of middle height; with round faces, thin lips, and frizzled hair. A popular story ran that the Mughal historians were so impressed by their fighting qualities that they changed the name Berad to Be-dar, meaning fearless. It is these fighting qualities that are of importance to our study. For the purpose of hunting and war the Berads had adopted the matchlock and had become adept in the use of this firearm [4] Their tribal organizationwhere headmen controlled different bands of younger fightersensured discipline and unity in their ranks. Not surprisingly they had become the steadiest and most accurate musketeers in 17th century South India. Another singular name used for them was kala-piadas or black foot-musketeers. Later on these same Berads formed the bulk of Tipu Sultans French-led infantry.The Berad King of Sagar used the title Nayak and is known in Persian histories as Pam Nayak. A confrontation simmered also between, on the one hand, the Berad leader, Umaji Nayak, and on the other, the Peshavas and their successors, the British, on account of the withdrawal of lands allotted at an earlier point in history to the Berad for military service under the Marathas. This proved to be the spark that ignited rebellion. As a ruling king of the Berad, Umaji Naik declared war on the British and issued a proclamation, demanding of all the inhabitants of Hindustan that they revolt against the Raj. Umaji was martyred when he was hanged by the British on 3rd February, 1832. Some got settled in Karnataka and later migrated to Maharashtra. The word 'Bhuyal' in Berad's language seems to have originated from Boya, though it is known in Maharashtra as Ramoshi-Berad, and the name 'Ramoshi' is not older than 100200 years. Innumerable Boya Berads sacrificed their lives in uprisings against the British. History knows very few names. The important names are: 1820-1831 Umaji Naik, Bhulaji, Pandu Naik revolted in Pune, Nagar, Nasik, Satara, Solapur, Kokan. Most of participants in these rebellions were Ramoshis. 1817 In the Gokak and Pachapur regions of Karnataka, Nayaks organized and rebelled. They were mostly Berads. The revolt of Kittur Channamma and Sangoli Rayanna in Karnataka had mostly Berads. 1817 Trimbak Dengale's revolt in Pune by Sardars in Peshaai- mostly Ramoshis, Bhils, and Kolis. 1857- Uprising of Rango Bapuji Gupte in Satara in the name of Chatrapati of Satara. Centres established for recruitment where Ramoshi Koli and Mangs were in majority. Two Madane Brothers of Ramoshi wadi (Koregaon Satara) and Nana Ramoshi of Kundal were killed by cannon. Many Ramoshis from Tasgaon in Bijapur Taluka participated. 1844-50 Tukaram and Mahankal, two sons of Umaji Naik, revolted. 1857- Berads of a village in the Halgali District, including Bijapur Karnataka, revolted against the Disarming Act. 19 Berads were hanged at Mudhol. 1857 Raja Venkatappa Nayak died in a rebellion in the Shurpur Gulbarga District. 18701880- Rebellion of Vasudev Balwant Phadake, was participated by mostly Ramoshis. The leader was Daulati Naik, who died in fight against Capt. Daniel in Tisubai Hills. Hari Ramoshi was hanged at Jejuri and Berads at Mudhol. 1910 Veer Sindhur Laxman rebelled against Sansthanik at Jat, but was betrayed and killed. Vajya - Baijya - fought against Saranjamdar at Kukudwad District of Satara. 1942 - 'Quit India' movement and formed 'prati sarkar' - parallel Government. Most Ramoshis of Satara Sangali Pune Districts participated The community was formerly classified as a criminal tribe under the Criminal Tribes Acts of the British Raj.[5] Though it is known in Maharashtra as Ramoshi-Bed, the name 'Ramoshi' is not older than 100200 years.The separation of berad and ramoshi took place as a part of the integration into the northerly territory of the peshwa those aspiring to rise under the brahmanical regime tried to sanskritise by becoming 'Ramavamshi' while those connected with Mysore or the nizam were content to remain 'Bedar',or fearless. But in Mysore however ,their military importance of the bedars elevated their standing,and the gazetter compiled at the early 20th century recorded that they 'have attained a high position in social scale '. They speak marathi of the lower orders . Mainly the dialect spoken is the marathi sprinkled with the canarese words.[6] Ramoshis have a collection of words,many of which are of telugu or Canarese derivation,which they use on special occasions,such as communicating some secret to their own kinsmen in the presence of outsiders.
