He was admitted to school in seventh standard.[clarification needed] at Victoria Institution in Calcutta. He studied chemistry at Scottish Church College, Calcutta.[1] The plots of his fiction are set amidst Calcutta families. Within the confines of these homes, he challenges the moral values of the fast-changing middle class of the city. Chattopadhyay frequently uses old men as his protagonists. These aged characters create the spiritual and philosophical edge found in his novels Lotakambal (The Blanket and Quilt) and Shakha Prasakha (Branches).
