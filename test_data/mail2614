The Old Town of Visoki [iski] was a famous medieval royal castle town during the fourteenth century, located in Visoko [isk], Bosnia and Herzegovina. The first mention of the town was on 1 September, 1355, in the charter "in castro nosto Visoka vocatum" written by Tvrtko I of Bosnia while he was a young ban.[1] The town was abandoned before 1503, because it is not mentioned in the Turkish-Hungarian treaty from the mentioned year.[2] In the year 1626 ori mentioned Visoki among abandoned towns.[3] The Old Town of Visoki is located at the top of 213 metre Visoica hill. It is positioned so that from it you have a brilliant view of the plains below. The entry to the castle is on the southwest side, with two lookout towers. Passing through the entry you enter to a part that is called Podvisoki, i.e. to the town that was quite small, measuring 60 meters by 25 meters, and has signs and remains of early medieval houses. The thickness of the castle town walls is about two meters. The Old Town of Visoki had the main function to serve as a defensive outpost. In addition to that, it is also the location where many important historic documents of medieval Bosnia were written and signed. The final document of importance signed there was by Tvrtko Borovini in 1436, showing that it was also of high importance to Bosnian Nobility.
