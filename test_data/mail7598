Wallerfield is an area in Trinidad and Tobago. Located south of Arima and north of Cumuto, it served Waller Air Force Base. Since the clousure of US Army base in May 1949, it became the informal home of various types of racing (using former airstrips) for over 40 years. Today construction progresses for the site of a new multi-million dollar University of Trinidad and Tobago campus complex, several housing developments and other projects. Further projects have been planned to transform it into Trinidad and Tobago first Science and Technology Research Park, which will be known as Tamana InTech Park.
