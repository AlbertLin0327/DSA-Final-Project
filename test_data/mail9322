Esperanza Diaz is a fictional character in thrillers such as Drop Shot, Deal Breaker and Promise Me written by Harlan Coben. Esperanza is introduced in the first book of the series, Deal Breaker, as one of Myron Bolitar's best friends, who works with him in MB SportsReps. She is described as having a petite frame and dark eyes, and being of Latino origin. She was formerly a professional wrestler known by her stage name Little Pocahontas and was part of FLOW (Fabulous Ladies of Wrestling) organization. She was usually teamed with her fellow female wrestler Big Chief Mama in her matches. Esperanza is shown to be bright and irreverent, with a caustic wit. She never knocks before entering Myron's office as a habit. She is seen to get along really well with Win, the other partner in the firm. The three of them seem to have a very profound relationship among themselves. Esperanza is seen to be protective of Myron at times. She is seen throughout the series to dislike Myron's on-again, off-again girlfriend, Jessica Culver, due to Jessica's having left Myron earlier. She finished studying Law in New York University by taking in night classes and is made a partner in MB SportsReps in book 7, Darkest Fear.
