The organ theft in Kosovo allegations (sometimes also known as the "yellow house" case) refers to a highly controversial case of an alleged crime of organ harvesting and killing of an indeterminate number of "disappeared" people (estimate figures such as a "handful",[1] up to 50,[2] and 24-100[3] were mentioned by various sources), mostly ethnic Serbian men from Kosovo, supposedly by perpetrators with strong links to elements of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in 1999. By 2011, about 1,900 "disappeared" people (about two-thirds of them ethnic Albanians) still remained missing from the Kosovo conflict.[4] According to these claims, the victims were chosen from a pool of between 100-300[3] combatants and civilians who were reportedly taken prisoner or kidnapped by the KLA during and after the Kosovo War; they were purportedly taken to detention centers and private homes in northern and central Albania.[3][5] According to the allegations, indicating the involvement or at least knowledge of several mid-level and senior KLA commanders,[3] the chosen victims were taken to a makeshift clinic near Tirana, Albania, where they were shot in the head and then had their organs removed.[6] The United Nations (UN) war crimes prosecutors investigated the case in 2002 and 2003, and again in 2004, but concluded there was insufficient evidence to prove that the organ harvesting ring existed.[7] In 2010, a report by Swiss prosecutor Dick Marty to the Council of Europe (CoE) uncovered "credible, convergent indications"[8] of an illegal trade in human organs going back over a decade,[6] including the deaths of a "handful" of Serb captives allegedly killed for this purpose.[1] On January 25, 2011, the report was endorsed by the CoE, which called for a full and serious investigation. Since the issue of the report, however, senior sources in the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) and many members of the European Parliament have expressed serious doubts regarding the report and its foundations, Marty having failed to provide "any evidence" concerning the allegations.[9] A EULEX special investigation was launched in August 2011.[10] A possibly related case of illegal, yet non-lethal, organ transplants at the Medicus clinic outside Pristina, Kosovo, is reportedly a part of an international organized crime network with links to the highest level of Kosovo's government.[6] The Medicus case resulted in several people indicted and arrested to be tried in two separate trials conducted in Kosovo and Turkey.[11] The allegations first appeared in the media with The Hunt: Me and the War Criminals, written in 2008 by Carla Del Ponte, a former International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) chief prosecutor, in which she claimed that Kosovo Albanians harvested organs of kidnapped ethnic Serbs after the armed conflict ended in 1999. These accusations were backed by her own visit of the site, several witnesses involved in and out of the ICTY, one of whom "personally made an organ delivery" to an Albanian airport for transport abroad, and "confirmed information directly gathered by the tribunal." Del Ponte concluded that if the case had been opened before Kosovo's declaration of independence, world governments may not have had the same stance on the Kosovo question.[12] However, Swiss government ordered Del Ponte to not discuss the case. She was accused of spreading unfounded rumors and even her former press secretary distanced herself from her.[2] Bernard Kouchner, former top UN representative in Kosovo, stated in April 2011: "We were aware of the extortions, but we never heard of organ trafficking," rejecting the accusations made by Del Ponte.[13] After the war in Kosovo, American journalist Michael Montgomery obtained testimonies from seven former KLA soldiers who claimed they had transported prisoners, dead and alive, from Kosovo to Albania. Some of his sources referred to the possibility of organ-trafficking and identified a yellow-colored small farmhouse in the small village of Rrip near the remote town of Burrel, Albania. Montgomery handed a summary of his research over to the Office of Missing Persons and Forensics (OMPF) at the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). A team of UN and ICTY investigators visited the house in February 2004, finding widespread traces of blood of uncertain provenance on the floor and medical surgical equipment on the rubbish dump and in the riverbed. The family living in the house offered contradictory and inconsistent explanations for the blood and equipment.[14][2] According to Del Ponte, witness statements indicated that a doctor, described as a Kosovar from Pe, might have removed the organs from up to 50 prisoners there.[2] The villagers objected to the exhumation of the graves where the witnesses had claimed that several victims had been buried under false Albanian names. The UN then shelved their investigation, lacking the mandate to investigate crimes committed after the war had ended and also having gathered insufficient evidence to support an indictment.[2] Most of the witnesses were taken to Italy for their protection and seem to have "disappeared from the face of the earth", presumably gone into hiding.[2] Information obtained by the Serbian radio and television B92 claimed that prisoners were allegedly trafficked in trucks from Kosovo to Gurr, Mat, in northern Albania, and to a KLA camp in Kuks, during and after the Kosovo War.[15] The organ harvesting was supposedly performed while the prisoners were alive in the so-called "Building/Prison #320",[15] 20km from the "yellow house" mentioned by Del Ponte as the site of the acts.[5] B92 also alleged to have documents revealing that Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha was asked by the KLA leader and former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj to send security forces to destroy all evidence connected to the disappearance and organ harvesting of Serbs from Kosovo that were transported to Albania.[15] According to the Serbian war crimes prosecution, "Building/Prison 320 is a neuro-psychiatric clinic. We believe that surgical operations were carried out there on civilians, as the conditions existed for such a thing. There was a prisoner camp there, as well as a KLA camp ... It differs markedly from what the Albanian prosecutor has been saying, who shut the case back in 2005."[5] Serbias war crimes prosecutor Bruno Vekari claimed that an additional 40 mental patients from Stimlje are thought to be victims of the organ theft as well.[7] However, the Humanitarian Law Center has conducted an investigation into the deaths of the named supposed victims (two women with severe mental disabilities) and established they died of natural causes and were not victims of organ trafficking.[16] The Serbian investigation was re-launched on March 21, 2008, just ahead of Del Ponte's book release on April 3, 2008, when the country's prosecutors claimed they have enough evidence "to search the whole of Albania for mass graves of Serbs."[17] Serbia urged Albania to cooperate and in late October 2008, Albanian officials replied that the charges were already investigated by the UN and Carla Del Ponte and that the Serbian government had no new evidence.[18] On November 14, 2008, UNMIK let Serbia's war crimes prosecutors join their side in a new investigation about the "yellow house".[19] On November 20, 2008, the ICTY started cooperating with Serbia on the case. Serbia received important information from the current ICTY chief Serge Brammertz, evidence of the alleged operation house in northern Albania, but the Albanian side wished not to cooperate. A report claimed that seven points were confirmed in the allegations and that the Albanian prosecutor and UNMIK had failed to tell the truth when investigating the findings of different surgical equipment.[20] According to the UN, the Albanian government has been trying to prevent inquiries into possible war crimes and the alleged involvement of KLA elements in organ trade,[21] even after proof of surgical procedures in the Burrel house was presented to them. Albanian officials believe that the allegations are not credible, while Human Rights Watch (who have been conducting its own investigation into the allegations, which HRW regards as "credible",[22] and have been calling for an independent probe to investigate alleged crimes by former leaders of the KLA[4]) believes otherwise, that simple harvesting on kidneys could have been easily performed even without surgical tools, although such were found at the scene.[22] In November 2008, several men were arrested after a bust on an organ trafficking ring in Pristina after a Turkish national, Dr. Yusuf Sonmez, was questioned by the Kosovo Police. Two urologists and a manager working in the private clinic Medicus, none of whom are qualified for surgical operations, only check-ups, were leading a business from their clinic that lasted from 1998 until their bust in late 2008.[23] In this case, which might be possibly closely related,[6] five (later nine) people, including former Kosovo government secretary of health, were indicted on October 15, 2010 by an EULEX court in Pristina, Kosovo, accused of a direct or indirect involvement in a number of non-lethal illegal kidney transplantations at the Medicus clinic, by luring impoverished people from Turkey, Russia, Moldova and Kazakhstan with the false promises of pay for their organs.[24][6] According to The Guardian, the newspaper "has established that organs are believed to have been shipped to Istanbul, in a criminal racket operated by Yusuf Sonmez, the same Turkish doctor wanted by Interpol for his alleged involvement in the Medicus clinic."[6] Sonmez is also believed to having been active in Baku, Azerbaijan, where a local investigation found "citizens of various countries" had been brought into the country for illegal kidney transplants. Reportedly, Sonmez was "involved" in the alleged racket, which also did operations in Ecuador. A group of four Ukrainian doctors were arrested in this case by Azeri and Ukrainian authorities. In addition, Sonmez, who has admitted to doing thousands of transplants, which he claims have been all voluntary for humanitarian purposes, has been repeatedly arrested for organ transplants in his native country.[1] On January 12, 2011, Yusuf Sonmez, dubbed "Dr. Frankenstein" by the Turkish media, was arrested in Istanbul.[25] In September 2011, Turkish prosecutor requested a 171-year prison sentence for Sonmez, charged with performing at least 11 illegal organ removal surgeries at the Medicus, illicit organ trafficking and forming of a criminal gang, demanding also the same sentence for the accused mediator, an Israeli citizen Moshe Harel.[11] In August 2009, representatives of the CoE under Dick Marty were prevented to search houses relating to the case by the local Albanians in the village of Rrip. The locals said that they would not let anybody other than from the Albanian government to investigate the case. The Albanian and Kosovo authorities stated they will not look into the case.[26][dead link] The Serbian war crime prosecution have said that new evidence have been found and that the investigation is ongoing.[27] The Council of Europe is still interested in the case and embassies are sending in their data to the war crimes committee and new potential witnesses have been found that could "open up the case in the real sense of the word".[28] On December 27, 2009, Serbian prosecutor Vladimir Vukevi announced that the names of "the people who were in the house" were uncovered, as well as alleged victims from beyond Kosovo, "some Russian and Czech citizens", and the organs were supposedly sold "in the West and East, in Turkey, Saudi Arabia".[29] In June 2009, a Kosovo Serb and two Serbians, accused of being provocateurs, were arrested by the Kosovo Police for allegedly offering money for statements on organ trade and mediators finding such information.[30] The three have been investigated for inciting people to falsely testify that they were victims of organ harvesting,[31] but were released in February 2010 and case was dismissed by EULEX.[32] In May 2010, EULEX chief war crimes investigator Matti Raatikainen said: "The fact is that there is no evidence whatsoever in this case. No bodies. No witnesses. All the reports and media attention to this issue have not been helpful to us. In fact they have not been helpful to anyone." According to BBC News, he said that "the main problem" was that "the scandal created by the allegations has distracted attention from the real work of finding the remains of 1,861 people still missing from the war and its aftermath, and prosecuting their killers - in Serbia, Kosovo and Albania." Earlier that same month, EULEX made the first arrest in connection with a case of illegal detention camps in Albania, especially in the north-east Albanian town of Kuks, which held ethnic Albanians suspected of disloyalty to the KLA, "but constant revelations in the Serbian press that new evidence, or new witnesses have emerged for the organ-trafficking allegations, have all proven either false, or unsubstantiated." One EULEX investigator called it a "fairy-tale". A source close to Serbian investigation was also quoted as saying "I still believe something happened there, but nothing on the scale of what has been suggested... and possibly not even connected to the KLA."[14] The European Union has set up an investigation, with the task force headed by U.S. prosecutor John Clint Williamson. Kosovo and Albania continue to deny the accusations. On May 2, 2012, Albania has drafted legislation allowing an EU-led investigation into the case, which would allow international investigators to conduct the probe on Albanian territory,[33] and the prime minister Sali Berisha stressed that for Albania it is "a priority" to investigate allegations made by Dick Marty.[34] On the 12 December 2010, a draft[35] report from Dick Marty to the Council of Europe was pre-released,[36] alleging that the Republic of Kosovo's prime minister, Hashim Thai was the head of a "mafia-like" group responsible for smuggling weapons, drugs and human organs through eastern Europe.[37] According to the report, the KLA held prisoners in a network of six facilities located in Albania, and that Thai's "Drenica Group" bears the greatest responsibility for the prisons and the fate of those held there.[37] "Some Serbians and some Albanian Kosovars were held prisoner in secret places of detention under KLA control in northern Albania and were subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment, before ultimately disappearing," the raport says.[34] A "handful" of the healthiest prisoners were supposedly transferred to a farmhouse near Fush-Kruj, not far the Albanian capital of Tirana, where they were killed for their kidneys.[37] The report states: "As and when the transplant surgeons were confirmed to be in position and ready to operate, the captives were brought out of the 'safe house' individually, summarily executed by a KLA gunman, and their corpses transported swiftly to the operating clinic." Some of the captives were aware of the fate that awaited them and pleaded not to be "chopped up".[38] The organs were then allegedly subsequently shipped to Istanbul, Turkey.[38] Marty's report, entitled "Inhuman treatment of people and illicit trafficking in human organs in Kosovo", was presented to Council of Europe Foreign relations committee on December 16, 2010, expected to be on the agenda of Session of Council of Europe in January 2011.[37][39] It made waves across the world and led to a series of similar reports.[40][41] The Swiss foreign ministry noted that Marty's report contained "grave accusations made on the basis of countless witness accounts and evidence."[42] The EULEX announced that they take the report very seriously and called for evidence.[43] On January 17, 2011, the EULEX Special Prosecutor's Office met with Albanian officials to discuss the organ case.[44] UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier said that EULEX, which is now in charge of dealing with war crimes in Kosovo, was given every war crimes file that the ICTY and the UN possessed, including witness statements.[45] Kosovo's government has denied the allegations and criticized the report as "biased", "politically motivated" and anti-Albanian". Speaking at a press conference, Marty claimed that the content of his report was known to Western intelligence agencies, who deliberately chose to downplay the allegations for the sake of foreign-policy objectives.[46] Kosovo interim President Jakup Krasniqi asked the EU not to endorse the report, saying "I welcome your support in not allowing adoption of this report as an official document of the Council of Europe."[47] Former Kosovo prime minister and KLA commander, currently Social Democrat leader Agim eku, accused Belgrade for the allegations, saying "Every accusation against the KLA comes from Serbia or its helpers. It's just an attempt to blacken our war and our victory."[48] Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha responded by calling Marty "racist and antisemitic",[49] while Albanian MP Shptim Idrizi alleged that the report "is something ordered by Russia and Serbia, and offers no facts. This is a story full of untruths and propaganda."[50] On other hand, Albanian former communist-era dissident Fatos Lubonja said it is important for an investigation to be conducted: "It matters not only for international justice, not only for the Serbs, it matters also for the Kosovo Albanians who have such leaders. If these leaders are criminals, if they face accusations of being criminals, they cannot create a democratic order."[15] Hashim Thai himself denied the allegations and his associates announced they would file a lawsuit against Marty.[42] He also announced that he will publish a list of witnesses who contributed to the report that would discredit it, stating "There are witnesses and evidence which shows in what way the report was made."[51] Even Thai's political opponents denounced the report and the accusations as "unacceptable".[35] In 2011, Marty retracted from earlier comments and claimed that his report has "never" implicated Thai directly, but his close associates. However, he added that it is "hard to believe that he [Thai] never heard about that."[52] On January 25, 2011, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) voted to adopt a resolution based on the Marty report. 166 PACE members voted in favor, while eight voted against the document. Several amendments proposed by the Albanian delegation were rejected and the Council called for a full and serious investigation.[50] The resolution calls on the international community and governments in Belgrade and Pritina, as well as in Albania, to "undertake measures" in order to clear up the crimes.[53] On February 8, 2011, The Wall Street Journal published an article by Denis MacShane questioning the allegations in Marty's report. According to an international lawyer Sir Geoffrey Nice, the Marty report provides no evidence, no victims and a witness that does not exist. Nice dismissed the allegations as attempts to undermine Kosovo's independence.[54] In March 2011, Marty presented his report to the European Parliaments Committee on Foreign Affairs (EU), whose members after the meeting said that Marty did not provide any evidence, while some of them claimed that he attacked and accused of bias those who questioned his report. In a heated debate, Marty told the MEPs that a witness protection program was needed in Kosovo, before he could provide more details on witnesses to the alleged trafficking as their lives were in danger.[9] In January 2011, The Guardian released NATO documents from 2004 describing Hashim Thai as being supposedly under the control of the Albanian mafia, in particular former KLA chief of logistics Xhavit Haliti. Haliti was described as "highly involved in prostitution, weapons and drugs smuggling", who "serves as a political and financial adviser to the prime minister."[55] Haliti uses fake passports to travel abroad as he is blacklisted in several countries, including the United Sates. "Haliti is also named in the report by Marty, which is understood to have drawn on NATO intelligence assessments along with reports from the FBI and MI5," according to the article.[56] On February 17, 2011, the media obtained a classified document[57] which suggests that the UN knew about the organ trafficking and the criminal involvement of senior KLA commanders, as early as 2003. Confidential material of the United Nations, given by an anonymous official, was confirmed on February 20, 2011, by former UNMIK Forensics and Missing Persons Office head Jose Pablo Baraybar.[45] The 30-page compilation of statements was made by at least eight "low to midlevel ranking KLA members" to the UN.[58] The documents have been given the name "CX-103".[59] Head of the ICTY Mission to Skopje and Pritina Eamon Smith sent a letter to the ICTY Chief Investigator Patrick Lopez Terez on October 30, 2003, informing him about his meeting and conversation with UNMIK Justice Department head Paul E. Coffey. Smith first presented his conclusions regarding the human organ trafficking case. In 2002-2003,[45] ethnic Albanian witnesses from Kosovo and Montenegro formerly serving in the KLA gave detailed testimonies about the revenge killings of Serbs and trade of kidneys, livers and other organs in the aftermath of the Kosovo War, as late as the summer of 2000. The witnesses claimed that between 100 and 300 people were kidnapped in mid-1999 and transported to detention facilities in northern Albania, where they were held in detention centers and some of these in the age 25-50 went through medical checks at given locations, and described how they buried victims to hide evidence of killings. The UN briefly investigated the claims but did not launch the probe, prompting accusations of double standards from Serbia.[58] Most of the victims were Serbs who were abducted in Kosovo between June and October 1999, the document stated.[59] They were allegedly held at different KLA-run prisons in Albania and in some cases their organs were removed at a home set up as a medical clinic, where specialized equipment and medical personnel were at place to carry out the operations.[58] In December 2003, top justice official in Kosovo Paul Coffey wrote to ICTY official in Kosovo Jonathan Sutch that the alleged crimes were reported to the UN in Kosovo by "multiple sources of unknown reliability." Coffey said the information was "based on interviews with at least eight sources, the credibility of whom is untested, all ethnic Albanians from Kosovo or Montenegro who served in the KLA."[45][58] One of the witnesses is quoted as telling the UN that the first two organ harvesting surgeries were done "to breach the market," and that traffickers later were able to make up to $45,000 per body. "The largest shipment was when they did 5 Serbs together. ... He said they took a fortune that time. Other shipments were usually from two or three Serbs," the source said according to the document.[58] A source said that the organs were taken through Tirana's International Airport Nn Tereza to the Atatrk International Airport in Istanbul, and that workers at the airports were bribed "to close their eyes." Two sources said they personally took part in delivering body parts (hearts, lungs, livers, kidneys) to Tiranas international airport. One source said he was instructed by his KLA superiors not to mistreat the prisoners and that he became suspicious when they were to deliver "a briefcase or a file with papers that would be given to the doctor when the captives were delivered" to the house in northern Albania, adding that he used to bring prisoners there but never drove any of them back.[58] Witnesses claim that top KLA members, doctors from Kosovo and abroad were fully aware of the transport and surgeries and that they were actively involved in them.[59] The sources also told the UN that the house where the organs were allegedly harvested was a two-hour drive from Tirana airport.[58] The UN and ICTY investigators visited a house in the village of Rrip in 2004 and found pieces of medical equipment, medicine boxes and blood traces.[58] Other alleged victims include some women described as "prostitutes", of whom at least two have been supposedly abducted in Albania.[3]
