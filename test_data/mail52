Speechlessness of Sadness, is a volume of Turkish modern poetry by Seyhan Kurt. "Hznn Szyitimleri"(Speechlessness of Sadness) was publishing in 1998.It consists of three parts "Deterritorial,Agnostic and Incognitae". We are given the loneliness,alienation,individualism and rebellion created by modern world.The subject matter gives Kurt's poetry its peculiar quality. As the author casts these subjects into his lines,he uses a sharp and complex style.His stanzas variegate in length and his poetry disturbs and re-forms the routine language.The word combinations strikingly violate the order with outstanding,unexpected images. His free-verse often depends on the cadence or grouping of phrases, and the reading depends on either a slowing down or a speeding up till it reaches an emphasis in the final lines.There is a yearning for a better and meaningful life.He pictures man lost in a universe sometimes conscious of his own position. For Seyhan Kurt,man has made the worst of himself and therefore is helplessly lonely. For his art, we can conclude that "the surface of the world and mankind have lost their privacy." One feels driven into a world which he has no control of.
