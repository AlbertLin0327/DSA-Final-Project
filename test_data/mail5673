Kirkby Stephen railway station serves the town of Kirkby Stephen in Cumbria, England. It is operated by Northern Rail, which provides all passenger train services. The station is nearly a mile from the town at Midland Hill and was formerly known as Kirkby Stephen West because of the older Kirkby Stephen or Kirkby Stephen East station that was situated in the town and was on the North Eastern Railway's Stainmore and Eden Valley lines. It closed (along with all the other stations apart from Settle and Appleby) in May 1970 but reopened in July 1986. The station is leased by the Settle and Carlisle Railway Trust, which comprehensively restored it in 2009.[1] The main buildings now incorporate a caretaker's flat, offices and the Midland Room, opened in July 2011,[2] which includes a cafe and exhibition of items related to the Settle and Carlisle railway. The station is served by seven trains in each direction on weekdays and Saturdays - northbound to Carlisle and southbound to Leeds. A new early morning SX service southbound began in May 2011. The first weekday northbound service now runs through from Leeds rather than arriving from Carlisle and returning there after a reversal as before). There are three departures each way on Sundays throughout the year. DalesRail services between Blackpool North/Preston and Carlisle also call at the station on summer Sundays.
