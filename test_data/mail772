The 1973 College World Series was played at Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, NE from June 8 to June 13. The twenty-seventh tournament's champion was the University of Southern California, coached by Rod Dedeaux. The Most Outstanding Player was Dave Winfield of the University of Minnesota. Winfield was the starting pitcher in two games, tossing 17 1/3 innings, allowing 9 hits, 1 earned run, and striking out 29. In addition, he batted .467 in the Series. Recalled each year as perhaps the most amazing game in CWS history, Minnesota faced a USC team that featured future major leaguers Rich Dauer, Fred Lynn, and Roy Smalley. Dave Winfield was the starting pitcher for Minnesota. In his first game vs. Oklahoma, he struck out 14 in shutting out the Sooners, 1-0. In the semi final vs. defending champion USC, Winfield had struck out 15 through 8 innings, allowing only an infield single as Minnesota built a 7-0 lead. USC's Rich Dauer said "In my whole career, even facing the big boys in the majors, I have never seen anything like that," When Dave let go of the ball, it was three feet in front of your face and it seemed like it was going 110 miles an hour." In the 9th inning, USC opened with a base hit but the next batter grounded into what appeared to be a double play. TV replays indicated the batter was out at first base, but the umpire called him safe and Minnesota coach Dick Siebert was thrown out of the game arguing the call. Two more singles and a key error by the 1st Baseman led to 3 runs and Winfield was relieved and went to left field. Two relievers allowed 5 more runs and USC won the game 8-7. "I have played in a lot of memorable big games during my career," Winfield said. "World Series games, league championship games, all-star games, all kinds. But I will never forget that game against USC. Never." The following players were members of the All-Tournament Team. Southern California becomes the first team to win four consecutive College World Series.
