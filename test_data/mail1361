Zilshausen in COC.svg Zilshausen is an Ortsgemeinde  a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality  in the Cochem-Zell district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Treis-Karden, whose seat is in the like-named municipality. The municipality lies on a high plateau in the northern Hunsrck between the valleys of the Ltzbach to the east and the Dnnbach to the west. Zilshausen has one outlying Ortsteil named Petershuser Hof. The village arose from an agricultural estate, which was mentioned in a document from 1346 as Zullinshausen. Zilshausen may well have belonged to the so-called three-lord territory, which was shared by three landholders, among them the Electorate of Trier and the House of Braunshorn-Metternich-Beilstein. This arrangement was brought to an end by the French Revolutionary occupation of lands on the Rhines left bank in 1794. In 1814 Zilshausen was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. In 1933, Nazism was welcomed in Zilshausen. That year, eight men from the village joined the Sturmabteilung and on 9 November, the anniversary of the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923, there was a memorial celebration for the heroes who fell in Munich that day. Three days later, there was an election, which included a referendum on Adolf Hitlers policies of withdrawing from the League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference. Ninety-five percent of the voters  the turnout was 98%  supported Hitler. The village chronicle comments: Unfortunately, two men had even voted no. They were seemingly not satisfied with the Hitler rgime, or had decided thus out of a lack of understanding. The anti-tank barriers put up at the ways into the village could not stave off Zilshausens conquest forever, and on 16 March 1945, the Second World War ended, at least for Zilshausen, when the village was overrun by American forces, only a day after German soldiers here had fled their posts[2]. Since 1946, Zilshausen has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman[3]. The German blazon reads: Ein silbernes Schildhaupt, darin ein durchgehendes rotes Kreuz belegt mit einer goldenen Lilie, gespalten in Grn, vorne ein silberner Grabhgel mit Urne, hinten eine goldene hrengarbe. The municipalitys arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per pale Or a barrow of stones within which an urn argent and vert a garb of the first, on a chief of the second a cross gules surmounted by a fleur-de-lis of the first. The translation argent as the tincture for the barrow and the urn is based on the German blazon, and indeed the arms shown at the municipalitys own website show these charges in silver. The red cross on silver borne in the chief is Electoral Triers old armorial bearing. The Electorate was the villages former overlord. The golden lily is Marys attribute, thus representing the municipalitys and the churchs patron saint, which Mary has been ever since the first chapel was built. The barrow with the urn inside stands for early settlement in what is now the municipality, and for the barrows from prehistory and early history found in the Linnif district. The golden wheat sheaf (garb in heraldry) recalls that the village arose from an agricultural estate. Agriculture, alongside other businesses that have set up shop, is still important to Zilshausen today. The arms have been borne since 1986[4]. The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinates Directory of Cultural Monuments: The Hunsrck-Mosel-Radweg, a cycling path, runs through the municipality.
