Saman Piyasiri a graduate of the University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka later joined the JVP and promoted to the higher ranks of the party, appointed as the militarty wing leader and finally led the party after the death of the founding leader Rohana Wijeweera. The military intelligence of Sri Lanka believes that Saman Piyasiri was masterminded the attacks on military bases and installations during the insurrection. On December 27, 1989 a special Police team led by SSP Lionel Gunathilake arrested Saman Piyasiri along with his mother and fiancee who is a sister of JVP politburo member Daya Wanniarachchi at Koswatte, Nawala at a rented house owned by Mark Antony Fernando who works at SLBC. According to the police sources, the number of military books found inside the house and some of them are not found in Sri Lankan military libraries. The Sri Lankan government media released on December 29, 1989, as "the leader of the JVP military wing killed along with four other cadres due to the cross fire between security forces and the JVP at their military wing head quarters, a farm located at Hedigama-Suwarapola, Piliyandala".[1] According to the Rohan Gunaratna Saman Piyasiri was killed by a special team along with two other JVP military wing members Ragama Somay and Pathi the Gampaha District military wing leader. Rohan Gunaratna also stated before his death he managed to deliver a speech to the service personnel around him about the society of Sri Lanka, capitalism and socialism.
