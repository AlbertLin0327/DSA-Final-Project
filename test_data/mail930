In Norse mythology, Herja (Old Norse) is a valkyrie attested in the longer of the two Nafnaulur lists found in the Prose Edda.[1] Rudolf Simek says the name is etymologically related to the Old Norse herja and Old High German herjn (meaning "devastate"), and derives from Proto-Germanic word *Herjaza. Simek notes that the West Germanic goddess name Hariasa (attested from a now lost 2nd century stone found in Cologne, Germany) also derives from *Herjaza, but says that "it is almost impossible to say whether Herja was in fact an original name of a goddess even among the North Germanic peoples," and that "an independent development is equally likely in the case of a 'goddess of war'."[2]
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
