Westfield Warrawong is a major shopping centre located in Warrawong, a suburb of Wollongong. With a retail floor area of 57,582m2 (619,807 sqft), it is currently the largest shopping centre in the Illawarra region. Westfield Warrawong was not always part of the Westfield Portfolio. Originally opened in 1960 as Lake Market Shopping Centre, it was acquired by the Westfield Group in 1985.[1] The centre has a current catchment area of 246,680 persons, and retail spending in the catchment area estimated at A$2.3 billion (2005).[1] Annual turnover at the centre for 2005 was $190.4 million with 5.4 million visitors per year.[1] In a 2004 survey conducted by the local city council, it found that the majority of visitors to the centre were attracted by its discount department stores.[3] Upon acquisition by The Westfield Group, the centre was extensively redeveloped and relaunched as Westfield Warrawong in 1988.[1] Further extensions were conducted in 1996, adding a 6,000m2 (64,583 sqft) Big W to the centre.[1][4] Previously, A Big W department store had been an occupant of the centre from 1965, however due to a change in retailling strategy by parent company Woolworths Limited, the then two level store was sold to David Jones Limited on April 19, 1971 and converted to a David Jones store which in turn was closed sometime in the mid 80's By 2011, the centre had grown to 57,582m2 (619,807 sqft) with 140 retailers.[5] In 1999, the centre received significant global coverage of its efforts to deal with shoplifting and anti-social behaivour.[6][7] In an effort to discourage local youth using the centre as a gathering place, the management used the centre's public address system to play older style music, including songs including Bing Crosby's 1938 song My Heart is Taking Lessons.[6][7] On 21 September 2004, a man sitting beside a tree outside the centre was the victim of a vehicle accident.[8] The man died after being hit by an out of control hatchback as he stood next to a tree outside the centre.[8] In March 2005, local bus company Premier Illawarra gave serious consideration to suspending one of its Thursday evening services from the centre due to months of increased vandalism and anti-social behaivour.[9] Despite the efforts of bus inspectors and transit police, very little had been achieved to curb the problems.[9] The centre is serviced by a public bus service operated by Premier Illawarra. --> Major retailers operating within the shopping centre include;[1] Major food retailers within the centre include;[10]
