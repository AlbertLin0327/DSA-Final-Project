Mitochondrially encoded 16S RNA (often abbreviated as 16S) is a mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rRNA)[1][2] that in humans is encoded by the MT-RNR2 gene. The MT-RNR2 gene also encodes the humanin polypeptide that has been the target of Alzheimer's disease research.[3][4] fatty acid degradation (Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, Long fatty acyl CoA synthetase) tryptophan metabolism (Kynureninase) oxidative phosphorylation (Coenzyme Q - cytochrome c reductase, Cytochrome c, NADH dehydrogenase, Succinate dehydrogenase) pyrimidine metabolism (Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase) mitochondrial shuttle (Malate-aspartate shuttle, Glycerol phosphate shuttle) citric acid cycle (Citrate synthase, Aconitase, Isocitrate dehydrogenase, Oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, Succinyl coenzyme A synthetase, Fumarase, Malate dehydrogenase) anaplerotic reactions (Aspartate transaminase, Glutamate dehydrogenase, Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) urea cycle (Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, Ornithine transcarbamylase, N-Acetylglutamate synthase) alcohol metabolism (ALDH2) steroidogenesis (Cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, Steroid 11-beta-hydroxylase, Aldosterone synthase), Frataxin Complex I (MT-ND1, MT-ND2, MT-ND3, MT-ND4, MT-ND4L, MT-ND5, MT-ND6) - Complex III (MT-CYB) - Complex IV (MT-CO1, MT-CO2, MT-CO3) ATP synthase (MT-ATP6, MT-ATP8) Large: 60S (5S, 5.8S, 28S)
