He is a prolific scholar well known in Astronomy and Imaging Science. Gatley received his BS (first-class honors) in Physics (1972) from the University of London (Imperial College). He earned his PhD in Physics (1978) from California Institute of Technology where he studied under Eric Becklin, Michael Werner and Gerry Neugebauer on board NASAs Kuiper Airborne Observatory.

His team also developed the first color infrared camera for Kitt Peak National Observatory in collaboration with the Space Telescope Science Institute. Gatley left NOAO for Rochester Institute of Technology in 1997 where he held several positions over his tenure including: Director of Chester F.
