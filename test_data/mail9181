The An Drochaid Museum and Historical Society was formed in 1980 and is located in Mabou, Nova Scotia. The museum and historical society was founded to catalogue and support Gaelic culture in the Mabou area. It also functions as keeping records of Mabous history. Built in 1875, it served as a general store and lecture hall until the late-1970s, then in the 1980s the building was purchased and used to create a heritage museum. The museum also functions as a cultural center, giving step-dancing, fiddle and piano lessons, holding Gaelic-related events and workshops. An Drochaid means The Bridge in Gaelic, which is the name Gaelic settlers gave Mabou.
