Syradalur (IPA:[siadal], Danish: Sydredal) is a village on the island of Kalsoy, one of the Faeroe Islands. Syradalur is the southernmost village on the island, and is in Hsa kommuna. On 1 January 2009, Syradalur had nine inhabitants, down from 12 in 1985.[1] Bjrn Kals comes from Syradalur. Syradalur is a niursetubygd founded at the beginning of the 19th century by inhabitants of the village of Blankskli on the south-west of the island.[2] Syradalur was previously inhabited in the 17th century, but the reason it was abandoned is unknown. In 1855, a boat from the village was sunk on a large boulder. In 1963, another boat from the village, this time carrying three men, was also sunk. A tunnel system was built in 1985 linking Syradalur with the other villages on the island. MF Sam travels the route between Syradalur and Klaksvk 69 times a day, and later a bus service from Syradalur to Trllanes, with stops at every village between, 24 times daily. In 2009, house numbers were introduced to the village, together with the three street names Dalsgta,  Bakkanum and Knksdalur.[3] Coordinates: 621443N 64002W / 62.24528N 6.66722W / 62.24528; -6.66722
