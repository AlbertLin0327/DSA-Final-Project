Coordinates: 511543N 10502W / 51.262N 1.084W / 51.262; -1.084 Basingstoke is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The town was represented in the Model Parliament of 1295, but not again until a constituency was created in 1885. Prior to 1885 it was represented by the North Hampshire constituency. With the exception of the 1923 election, it has always elected Conservative MPs. It is a Conservative safe seat. The Basingstoke constituency is based around the town of Basingstoke, and the surrounding countryside, in Hampshire. The Boundary Commission has proposed that the boundaries of Basingstoke and North West Hampshire be aligned to more closely match the town area.
