Brezje pri Dobrovi is an elongated village in the Municipality of DobrovaPolhov Gradec in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia[2] on the road from Dobrova to Horjul. It lies on the somewhat elevated north side of the marshy valley of Horjulka Creek and it also includes the hamlet of Poljno Brdo to the east of the main settlement. Klju Hill (623 m) rises above the settlement to the north, and Strmca Hill (472 m) to the south.[3] The name of the settlement was changed from Breze to Brezje pri Dobrovi in 1953.[4] Brezje pri Dobrovi literally means 'Brezje near Dobrova'. The name Brezje is shared with several other places in Slovenia and is derived from the word brezje 'birch grove'.[5] The local church is dedicated to Saint Agnes.[6] The church was first mentioned in 1526. It was originally built in Gothic style, but was remodeled in Baroque style in 1729 and 1758.[3]. The church is registered as a cultural monument.[7] A school was established in the village in 1911 in a private home, and a schoolhouse was built in 1928.[3] On 12 May 1942 there was a pitched battle at nearby Klju Hill between the Partisans and the Italians, during which the village came under fire, and was then burned on 13 May.[3] In addition to the Church of Saint Agnes, Brezje pri Dobrovi has several structures registered as cultural heritage: Notable people that were born or lived in Brezje pri Dobrovi include: Administrative centre: Dobrova
