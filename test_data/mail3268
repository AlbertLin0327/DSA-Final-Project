In all, there were ten children - eight brothers and two sisters.[2] His brothers included fellow Olympians Rene and Ric [3] and boxer Roger. "They were the phenomenal 'boxing brothers' of the country, using boxing as their ticket to a good education and consequently, a better life." He "at age 16 captured the flyweight title in the National Youth Amateur Boxing bouts in Bacolod City," in the Philippines. He then went on to win "six golds, one silver and two bronzes in 11 international boxing competitions."

He was 119lbs (54kg), and 5'5" (164cm).[5] He is married to the former Araceli "Cely" Angeles, who is also business manager of their family enterprises. They have three children.[6] They reside in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Fortaleza moved to Canada in 1990 where he first worked at a silkscreening job for minimum wage and then trained and worked as a hospital janitor and maintenance person. He owned and ran a boxing gym briefly before entering newspaper publishing.[7] He is publisher of the Philippine Asian News Today and of Living Today magazine[8] through the Reyfort Media Group.[9] He also holds a franchise in the Philippines-based ABS-CBN TV Patrol World, a news program which is available through a local Vancouver cable channel.[10] Through his newspaper he has fostered and supported four years of the Metro Vancouver-area singing contest, the PNT Singing Idol competition. On 18 February 2010 Fortaleza was honoured by Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson for his 1976 Olympic and current Canadian contributions.[11] He was previously honoured by the Multicultural Sports Development Society for his role in "outstanding sports achievements and contributions to Philippine Sports."[12] He has been recognized for his role in bringing Filipino entertainment and sports figures to entertain Vancouver Filipino audiences and was named by an international Filipino association, Binibining Pilipinas of the World, as one of the "ten most outstanding Filipino Canadians."[13][14]
