The Chennai Metro Rail is a rapid transit system in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. The Phase I of the project consisting of two corridors covering a length of 45.1km is under construction. The elevated section of the project is scheduled to be operational by 2013 and the entire project is scheduled to be completed by the financial year 2014-2015. About 55% of the corridors in Phase I is underground and the remaining is elevated. Chennai is the 4th largest metropolitan city in India. Chennai, often known as the Detroit of Asia, is widely known for its presence in the automotive industry and has attracted several global automakers to set up their factories in the city becoming one of the global leaders in the industry. Apart from automobiles, it also has development centres set up by many software companies which contributed 14% of India's total software exports of INR144,214 crore (US$28.77 billion) during 200607, making it the second-largest exporter of software in the country, behind Bangalore. Based on all these industrial and technological advancements, urban population has risen rapidly, requiring need for faster and safer transportation at all times. The city already has multiple modes of transportation. A bus system is run by the Chennai MTC and is augmented by the Chennai suburban railway network run by the Southern Railway. In addition to this, the Southern Railway has also implemented the Chennai MRTS project; an elevated railway system was sanctioned in 1984 to ease congestion in central Chennai. However, traffic congestion was still a big problem for both the citizens as well as the City's governing body. Hence, the Chennai Corporation has decided to implement the Chennai Metro project which will be another alternate transportation mode to a metropolis like Chennai. Mr K.Rajaraman IAS, 1989 Batch Officer of Tamil Nadu cadre is the Managing Director of CMRL. After the success of the Delhi metro, a similar system was mooted for the city of Chennai by E. Sreedharan of the DMRC to the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Karunanidhi.[3] The plan was later dropped in favour of a highly ambitious monorail network, spread over the whole city during Jayalalitha's tenure.[4] Karunanidhi revived the metro rail project to life once again by including it in the 2007-08 State Government's budget, and an amount of Indian Rupee symbol.svg 50 crores had been sanctioned for preliminary works which included a Detailed Project Report (DPR) to be prepared by the DMRC Rail Project. The approval for the project was finally given by the state cabinet on 7 November 2007[5] and is to be executed by a Special purpose vehicle, the Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL). A Total of 7 lines have been planned by the DMRC for Chennai Metro Rail Project.[6] Several studies and proposals have been made to identify new lines to augment the two lines under construction. Two corridors have been proposed in the comprehensive transportation study submitted by Wilbur Smith Associates [7] from Medavakkam to St. Thomas Mount and Pathanapuram to Lighthouse via Radhakrishnan Salai. A metro line from Thiruvanmiyur to Kottivakkam and beyond via ECR has been proposed by CMRL in the steering committee meeting of the department of Highways and Minor Ports. But it has been decided to defer it for present and take it up later. This was proposed as an alternate for the East Coast Elevated Expressway[8] A project study was taken up to establish links between Moolakadai--Thirumangalam, Moolakadai--Thiruvanmiyur and LuzPoonamallee through Iyyappanthangal.[9] Apart from these, there are demands to extend the Metro Rail to Tambaram.[10] State Government is considering extension to Tambaram.[11] The MRTS, operated by Southern Railway, is proposed to be taken over by the CMRL thereby bringing all the elevated tracks and underground tracks inside the city under one organization. The Chennai MRTS is a well executed project and is a fully public service oriented enterprise at present. After the merger, it is proposed to replace the current EMUs in the MRTS with huge cost air-conditioned coaches with automatic doors.[12] Southern railway has given its approval for an elevated section of metro rail in Guindy.[13] According to the detailed project report submitted by the DMRC, there are two lines planned: Line 1: Wimco Nagar  Chennai Aiport [32.1 km] Line 2: Chennai Central  St Thomas Mount [22 km] Corridor 1 is intended to cover the Anna Salai stretch and corridor 2 is intended to cover Poonamalle High Road and Inner ring road. The project is estimated to cost around INR14,600 crore (US$2.91 billion) for the two corridors totaling 45km. However, the previous estimate in 2007 was INR9,565 crore (US$1.91 billion).[15] But it is likely to increase by 23% to INR18,000 crore (US$3.59 billion)[16] The Underground tunneling will cost about Rs 300 crores per km, whereas Elevated track will cost about Rs 100 crores per km. The estimated construction cost of Underground and Elevated Station will be Rs 100 crores and Rs 300 crores respectively.[17] A total of 32 stations have been planned along the two corridors. As many as 19 stations are underground and 12 are elevated. Of these, the Chennai Central (Underground) and Alandur (Elevated) are common for both the corridors and serve as interchange stations. Underground Stations (12):Sathiyamoorthy Nagar,Tiruvottiyur, Washermanpet, Mannadi, High Court, Chennai Central, Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, LIC, Thousand Lights, Gemini, Teynampet, and Saidapet Elevated Stations (6): Little Mount, Guindy, Alandur, Officer's Training Academy, Meenambakkam and Chennai International Airport. Underground Stations (9): Chennai Central (Interchange), Egmore, Nehru Park, Kilpauk Medical College, Pachaiyappa's College, Shenoy Nagar, Anna Nagar East, Anna Nagar Tower and Tirumangalam. Elevated Stations (8): Koyambedu, CMBT, Arumbakkam, Vadapalani, Ashok Nagar-KK Nagar, SIDCO, Alandur (Interchange) and St. Thomas Mount (Parangimalai) The metro corridors would provide connection with various other transport systems in the city: The CMRL also planned to construct a 400 metre long flyover along Inner Ring Road, Chennai at the junction of Arcot Road in Vadapalani on either side of the metro viaduct.[18][19][20] The construction started on 10 June 2009 with the piling work for the elevated viaduct between Koyambedu and Ashok Nagar stretch. Construction is expected to be fully completed by February 2015. The first section to be opened will be on Line 2 between Koyambedu and St. Thomas Mount and this stretch is likely to be in operation by 2013. Line 3: Moolakadai  Thiruvanmiyur [19 km] Line 4: Moolakadai  Thirumangalam [22 km] Line 5: Mylapore  Poonamallee [22 km] Three lines covering a distance of 63km[21] have been proposed in Phase II. Detailed project report is to be prepared in a year.[22][23][24] Moolakadai  Madhavaram - Retteri Junction - Villivakkam Railway Station - Periyar Nagar Bus Terminus - Venus - Perambur - Aynavaram Bus Terminus - Kellys - Purasaiwalkam - KMC Hospital  Egmore - Thousand Lights  Mylapore  Thiruvanmiyur Moolakadai  Vinayagapuram/Teachers Colony - Surapet - Redhills  Ambattur OT - Maduravoyil Junction - MMM Hospital - Thirumangalam Junction Mylapore  Luz  Teynampet  T Nagar  Vadapalani  Saligramam - Iyyapanthangal  Poonamallee Chennai Metro Rail work in progress near the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly-secretariat complex Constructed Metro rail bridge as seen early in the morning near the Spic House Barricade showing CMRL and Soma Viaduct work by SOMA.

Date July 5th 2011 In 2011, a safety assessment carried out at the Chennai airport to explore the viability of the upcoming metro rail link identified several risks. The assessment, done on various parameters set by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), concluded that there is over 95 percent risk in allowing the metro rail link construction in its current format. On a scale of 1 to 7, with 7 being the most substantial risk, DGCA rated '7' to all of the parameters such as electromagnetic effect from the moving train, performance loss of an aircraft, sabotage probabilities and other such critical risks.[53] The Chennai Metro Rail project is estimated to result in the loss of 17,000 trees.[54] Kollywood Theosophical Society Adyar Gaana KM Music Conservatory Kalakshetra Madras Music Academy Cholamandal Artists' Village Tamil cuisine Dakshina Chitra Alliance Franaise de Madras Schools in Chennai Connemara Public Library Anna Centenary Library Birla Planetarium Government Museum
