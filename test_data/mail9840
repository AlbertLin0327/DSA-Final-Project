The University of WisconsinMarathon County (UWMC), part of the University of Wisconsin Colleges, is a two-year campus of the University of Wisconsin System. Located near downtown Wausau, Wisconsin, United States and adjacent to 78-acre (32ha) Marathon Park, it is one of two postsecondary schools in the city, the other being Northcentral Technical College. UWMC's campus consists of six buildings: the main building, the fieldhouse, the ceramics/pottery building, the art building, Marathon Hall (residence hall), and the Center for Civic Engagement. UW-Marathon County has an average enrollment of 1,400 students, and an average class size of 23 students. At UWMC, 53.3% of students are male, and 9.7% are minority students. UWMC is the home of the Wisconsin Public Radio Wausau Regional Studio. The current dean is Keith Montgomery. The University offers courses leading to either an associates degree or the Guaranteed Transfer Program, under which students are guaranteed admission to a four-year University of Wisconsin System college of their choice if they meet the academic requirements. UW-Marathon County also has a collaboration program with UW Stevens Point and UWOshkosh that allows students to be dually enrolled in both colleges, and to take select courses from those colleges on the UW-Marathon County campus, to earn bachelors degrees in Business Administration, General Studies, Web and Digital Media Development, and Nursing. UWMC also has an agreement with neighboring Northcentral Technical College (NTC) whereby a student can earn a one-year, 30- to 32-credit general studies certificate at NTC then transfer to UWMC to complete the Associate of Arts and Sciences degree. The University of Wisconsin-Marathon County sponsors teams in golf, basketball, volleyball, and soccer. UWMC has a pool, a weight room, an open gym, and a racquetball court in the field house. The school mascot is the Husky. UWMC's sponsored school newspaper is The Forum, a student-run organization with issues printed monthly during the academic year and one issue printed during the summer. The Forum distributes upwards of 5,000 newspapers per issue. The paper has a Facebook fan page and distributes throughout the Wausau Metropolitan Statistical Area. UWMC's student governing organization is the "Student Government Association". It has six officers, and twelve senators who represent student interests and help create student event and activity programming. The campus is a member of United Council, a lobbying organization that represents 23 of the 26 UW campuses at the state level, as well as a member of Student Governance Council, the organization that represents the 13 two-year campuses that comprise the University of Wisconsin Colleges.
