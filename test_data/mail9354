Algerian Braille is a braille code for writing the Arabic language in Algeria. As of 1990, it was used only in Algeria, Arabic outside of Algeria being represented by another braille encoding. It is based on the original numeric ordering of braille patterns, with Arabic letters assigned to those patterns in alphabetical order. The standard Arabic braille used outside of Algeria is based on romanization, and does not preserve Arabic alphabetical ordering.[1] Algerian-type alphabeticalnumerical ordering was common in early braille systems, but was largely abandoned in favor of unified braille beginning in 1878; Algerian braille is perhaps the only system other than the original French braille to still use it.
