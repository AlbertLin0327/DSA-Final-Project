Timo Somers (born 15 December 1991) is a Dutch guitar player, songwriter, producer and singer. He is known as the founder of Tri-Head and member of symphonic metal band Delain, legendary rock band Vengeance and Zylver. Timo started exploring the world of guitar on his own, without any lessons or whatsoever when he was 12. 'Music is the ultimate form of self-expression, Timo says. 'I could not possibly imagine a life anymore without it, whether I am sad, happy, confused, crazy, I always find a way to express my feelings through my guitar, a life without a guitar is like a life without a soul, for me. Timo joined Vengeance when he was 17. When he was not touring Europe with them he was riting and recording songs for his own song library. At the age of 18 Timo started studying at the Rockacademie, which he quit a year later when he joined Dutch symphonic metal band Delain. He tours the world with them and played on their 3th studio album 'We Are The Others'. On 28 January 2011 his dad, fellow guitar player, best friend and biggest inspiration Jan Somers passed away. Vengeance recorded the studio album 'Crystal Eye' in his name. Timo appeared on 2 songs (Promise me and Crystal Eye). Shortly afterwards Timo was asked to join Zylver. A Dutch project with some of Holland's best session musicians. Their debut album ' Van Verre' will be released Summer 2012. Timo is currently working on his debut instrumental album together with Atma Anur (Journey, Richie Kotzen, Greg Howe, Jason Becker, etc.), Barend Courbois (Blind Guardian, Vengeance) and special guests.
