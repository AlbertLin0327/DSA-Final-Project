Povrje is a settlement to the west of Raka in the Krko municipality in eastern Slovenia. The area was traditionally part of Lower Carniola. It is now included with the rest of the municipality in the Spodnjeposavska statistical region.[2] There is a small chapel in the settlement, dedicated to the Mother of God. It was built in 1923.[3] Administrative centre: Krko
