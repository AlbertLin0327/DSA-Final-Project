rajbarski Turn Castle (Slovene: Grad rajbarski turn, "Schreiber's Tower," German: Turn am Hard, also known as Leskovec Castle Slovene: Grad Leskovec) is a 16th century castle located in the municipality of Krko in central Slovenia. Two manors on the site are first mentioned in 1436, held by baron Johann Drrer (von der Dur) concurrently with the Counts of Celje, and later sold to the latter. The formidable castle was taken and looted by peasant rebels in 1515. The Celje counts were followed by several other owners, including baron Janez Valvasor in 1581, the counts Mosconi, the house of Auersperg from 1653-1903, baron Gagern, and a Dr. Trenz. rajbarski Turn is a typical example of centrally-based defensive architecture with corner towers and a rectangular, arcaded inner courtyard in the middle. The current structure dates from the second quarter of the 16th century, and was substantially complete by the mid-16th century. The four residential wings enclose the most significant architectural feature of the building, a beautiful arcaded courtyard. Above the main gate to the castle there is a relief of the coat of arms of the house of Auersperg-Falkenhayn; the courtyard wall displays the arms of the noble family Khysl. The 17th century renaissance-style castle park contains a monument erected in memory of Alfonz Paulin (1853-1942), a famous Slovene botanist and son of the castle warder. rajbarski Turn and the surrounding grounds were declared a cultural monument of national importance by the government of Slovenia in 1999.
