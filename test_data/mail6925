The Lior et Olivier LeO 12 was a night bomber built in France in 1924.[1] It was a large biplane of conventional design, with three-bay equal-span wings and twin engines mounted in nacelles on struts in the interplane gap. The independent main undercarriage units were faired in long, trouser-style spats. Construction throughout was mainly duralumin, skinned in fabric. The pilot's cockpit was open, and there was a second cockpit amidships for a gunner.[1] When the French Air Force was not interested in the type, three of the four examples built were modified for other roles. One became a 12-seat passenger transport that Lior et Olivier operated on an airline subsidiary, another had its cockpit and gunner's hatch enclosed and was used by the French air ministry as an experimental testbed, and the third received new engines and better defensive armament and was again demonstrated to the army. The reception to this type, the LeO 122, was barely more enthusiastic, but Lior et Olivier used it as the basis for further development work that would result in the successful LeO 20.[1] General characteristics Performance
