This article is part of the series: Politics and government of Malawi General elections were held in Malawi on 26 and 27 June 1992. As the country had become a single-party state in 1966, the Malawi Congress Party was the sole legal party at the time. The number of seats in the National Assembly was increased to 141, whilst President-for-life Hastings Banda was able to appoint as many additional members as he saw fit to "enhance the representative character of the Assembly, or to represent particular minority or other special interests in the Republic."[1] In total, 275 candidates contested the 141 seats, although in 45 there was only a single MCP candidate, who was elected unopposed.[1] Voter turnout was reported to be 80% by the government, but was actually around 40%.[2] 62 incumbents lost their seats.[1] In 1993 a referendum on returning to multi-party democracy was held. Following a victory for the "yes" vote, the MCP ceased to be the sole legal party.
