Howard G. Malley is a 45 year veteran of television production, known mostly for his work on We are the world. He began as a Unit Manager for NBC overseeing the "Today Show Bicentennial" series of 50 remotes, one from each state, honoring the Bicentennial of the United States. Malley had the opportunity to visit each state and highlight its contribution to the country. His biggest contribution was as a producer of all of "The We Are The World" video including the historic recording in January, 1985 and continuing for 4 months to produce not only a music video, but a one-hour HBO special generating over five million dollars for the hunger project. He worked on this project with friend Craig B. Golin and his later to become wife, April Grebb (Malley). No project before or since has been able to be put together with no money spent. The recording of this took place in January, 1985. While standing in Ken Kragen's driveway, Malley and associates agreed to take on the production and told Kragen it would be done strictly with volunteer labor and donated equipment. The Klages Group (now Design Partners) provided all of the lighting equipment and staging labor; Greene/Crowe donated the cameras and tape equipment; The Post Group provided all of the post production facilities, and Malley persuaded all of the technical crew to donate their time. This was the only production produced at no financial cost. It was a historic event that Malley and associates made happen. Had it not been for this group, the record may have been made, but there would have been no music video or documentary that still has relevance today.[1] They would win an Oscar for informational specials in 1986. [2] Other notable projects included four Kenny Rogers TV Specials, Vice President of Production for Vin Di Bona productions overseeing the long running "America's Funniest Home Videos". He worked on many project for dick clark productions until becoming ill and having to step back from his love.
