Ronald Percy "Ronnie" Bell FRS[1] (1907  9 January 1996) was a British chemist who worked in the Physical Chemistry Laboratory at the University of Oxford, England. Bell worked in the laboratory of the Danish physical chemist Johannes Nicolaus Brnsted from 1928 to 1932. Later, he was particularly active in Oxford with his research group between 1945 and 1967. He was a Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford (where he had previously been a student) from 1933 to 1967, when he was appointed an honorary fellow on his move to become Professor of Chemistry at the newly founded University of Stirling in Scotland.[2] Bell could be called by the hybrid term, a "physical organic chemist", since he investigated the use of physicochemical methods to discover the mechanisms of organic reactions. He was a colleague of Edmund Bowen[3]
