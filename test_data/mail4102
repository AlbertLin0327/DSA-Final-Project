Gregory Brian Minton (born July 29, 1951 in Lubbock, Texas) is a former Major League Baseball right-handed pitcher who played for the California Angels and San Francisco Giants. Minton enjoyed a 16-year major league career, from 1975 to 1990, and was a member of the 1982 National League All-Star Team. His nickname, "Moon Man," stemmed from various escapades such as the hijacking of the team bus and the flooding of a minor league ballpark so he could leave Amarillo one day early at the end of the season. Minton went three full seasons (269 1/3 innings) without allowing a home run until John Stearns homered against him on May 2, 1982. This still is the longest such streak in the post-1920 live-ball era. A crippling injury in 1979 caused Minton to alter his delivery. Instead of using his then-normal high leg kick, Minton shortened his stride to take pressure off his knee. The new delivery gave Minton a 92-mph sinker that batters were unable to drive. After his career as a player, Minton was a pitching coach in the California Angels' organization, and managed the Class A Lubbock Crickets for two years. On August 14, 1986, Minton gave up the last of Pete Rose's Major League record 4,256 career hits.
