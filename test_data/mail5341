I Like It Rare 3 is the third Split Enz fan club release. It was released in 2005 as a tribute to the death of the drummer Paul Hester who played on the group's last studio album before the group broke up in 1984. The songs included range from songs written by Hester as early as the early 1980s when he joined Split Enz, to some written in his time with Crowded House and some written solo and with his group Largest Living Things in the late 1990s.
