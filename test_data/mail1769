FACTORY311 is a creative agency specialising in visual production and image licensing based in Soho, London. The agency produces visual solutions and licenses fashion, beauty, illustration, celebrity, music and sport photography. FACTORY311 was founded by Creative Director Nicholas Hardy in 2005. FACTORY311 was originally dedicated to street art and photography, pioneering the work of Spanish graffiti artist Belin.[1] Hardy initially started his career in marketing and promotions which allowed him to travel across the world to places like Dubai, Miami, Palma, and Ibiza which sparked his interest in street based art. Hardy later settled in Marbella, where he taught himself how to use Adobe Photoshop and started designing flyers for Head Kandi Ibiza. After 5 years in Marbella, Hardy returned to Manchester and joined the team at Creative Spark agency before deciding to start his own agency. FACTORY311 began in Hardys apartment in the Manchesters Northern Quarter - Smithfield's 311 - with just a computer.[2] The first artist to be represented by FACTORY311 was Spanish graffiti artist Belin who created a series of murals for the Bread and Butter project in Barcelona in collaboration with FACTORY311. After Belin graffiti artists Tassel, SatOne, Rabodiga, Mhrywan and Otes joined together to form the team of mural artists. The team caught the eye of American tattoo artist, model and television star Kat Von D[3] from LA Ink who commissioned a mural for the wall of her High Voltage Tattoo studio in Los Angeles. Whilst in Los Angeles, Hardy met celebrity photographer Lionel Deluy who became the first photographer to be signed to the agency. After getting involved with LA based illustrator Soem One, Hardy along with his growing team of creatives began to create fantasy murals mixing Deluys photography with Soems illustrations. The collaborations sparked interest from Warner Brothers and Wiz Khalifa who had a mural painted by Belin.[4] In 2009, FACTORY311 along with Lionel Deluy worked together on the Evolution exhibition[5] at De La Barracuda on Melrose Avenue. The exhibition included photographs of Dita Von Teese, Gary Oldman, Katy Perry, Ice Cube, The Game and David Lynch. The success of the exhibition resulted in magazine requests and works for Ed Hardy and Chris Brown. Hardy returned to Manchester after the Evolution Exhibition and decided to move to London starting in Camden North London. The London agency started by designing flyers for local businesses until gaining contracts from major brands like Manchester United, JD Sports, Cosmopolitan and Company Magazine. The agency then moved to Studio9 in London Fields where they shared an office space with Happy Kitchen. FACTORY311 settled in Bethnal Green, before moving to a central London location in September 2011, with a move to the iconic Denmark Street, Soho. FACTORY311 has since worked on advertising campaigns for Umbros World Cup shirts, Adam Lambert's Glam Nation Tour,[6] Art of Motion for Red Bull[7] Arsenal F.C player,[8] Arsenal 360, Arsenal World and Arsenal Classics. FACTORY311 now includes an image licensing department which has syndicated images to international publications[9] such as Vanity Fair Italia, Harpers Bazaar, Cosmopolitan UK, Marie Claire Russia, Glamour Italia and ES magazine as well as Nike and Fiona Paxton. FACTORY311 photographers have also featured on Vogue Italia's photo vogue website.[10] The image licensing archive currently covers fashion, beauty, illustration, celebrity, music and sport photography for print publication and digital media. FACTORY311 also publishes a large format newspaper F311, which is distributed internationally to industry folk, clients, friends and fans of the agency. Published four times a year seasonally, F311 showcases the best of FACTORY311 from recent shoots and campaigns.
