Antonio Sagarda-De Jess served as Attorney General of Puerto Rico, appointed by Governor Luis Fortuo and sworn in by Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock on January 2, 2009.[1] He resigned effective December 23, 2009.[2] In May 2009 Mr. Sagardia was involved in a confrontation with representative Luis Vega Ramos during a budget hearing after Vega Ramos questioned contracts the Puerto Rico Justice Department had awarded to Sagardia's former partner Vctor A. Ramos. It had previously surfaced that Sagardia, acting as Attorney General, had granted the release from prison of a convicted murderer represented by his former partner. During the confrontation Mr. Sagardia excitedly called Vega Ramos a scoundrel, a chump lawyer and an intellectual dwarf.[3] As the top law enforcement official in Puerto Rico, Sagarda headed a unified prosecutorial system in which all district attorneys are appointed by the Governor and served under Attorney General Sagarda. On its own discretion and authority, the Office of the Attorney General may investigate constitutional and politically sensitive issues.[4] Prior to taking office, Sagarda embarked on the task of reviewing the Justice Department's conduct, during several politically sensitive investigations carried out under his predecessor.[5] In the event that the Governor of Puerto Rico is traveling away from Puerto Rico, the Attorney General is second in the line of succession, after the Secretary of State. On January 18, 2009, Attorney General Sagarda served as the first Acting Governor of Puerto Rico during the 2009-2013 term, when Governor Fortuo and Secretary of State McClintock both attended the inaugural ceremonies of President-Elect Barack Obama. Sagarda, born in 1957, is a former district attorney and attorney in private practice, before and after serving as Attorney General. He is a member of the Governor's New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico,[6] and a graduate of the University of Puerto Rico.
