Blood Eagle was a British thrash metal band. It was formed in 1988 by Dan Yates (vocals/guitar) and Matt Yates (Bass), joined by former Morbid Mortuary guitarist Andrew Renshaw who was the other key member. Various other members spent a short time with the band. This band lasted 3 years before fading into oblivion. The band had two low budget releases, 'A Damn Good British Thrashing' and 'The Skeleton Army EP'.
