Trigger is an EP and song by the Swedish melodic death metal band In Flames, the EP was released in 2003 from their 2002 album, Reroute to Remain. The title song was featured on the Freddy vs. Jason (soundtrack). The music video for the single "Trigger" featured In Flames playing a club and being constantly pestered and booed by the members of Soilwork, with interspersed footage of other incidents between the two bands. The Soilwork video for "Rejection Role" showed the situation vice versa, Soilwork playing and In Flames as the bullies. In each video the colour is reversed as well: blue for In Flames, red for Soilwork. Both videos also featured the other band riding in a pickup truck to and from the club. While some believed the tension between the two bands to be real, in reality the groups are close friends and devised the idea of a dual-video concept as a joke.
