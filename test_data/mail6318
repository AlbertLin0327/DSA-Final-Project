Holy Cross Catholic Academy High School (or Holy Cross) is a Catholic high school. It was first established in September 1986 to serve western Woodbridge, a community in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. The school has offered instruction to grades seven through nine when it first opened and added a new grade each successive year. The school now serves grades nine through twelve (ages 14  18). In 1990, the first group of students graduated from Holy Cross Catholic High School. While the present building was under construction, the school operated out of what is now San Marco Elementary School, located nearby its present location. Staff and students began using the existing facilities in September 1989. His Grace Arch Bishop [Robert Clune] blessed the building on May 2, 1990. The school's tenth anniversary was inaugurated with the planting of a tree at the front of the school, which is marked by way of a metal plaque. Holy Cross Catholic High School was converted to a Catholic Academy in 1998 due to pressures from the Ontario government (Mike Harris' Conservative government) to enhance education in technical development.
