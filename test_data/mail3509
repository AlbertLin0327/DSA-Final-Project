Jacques Peirotes (1869, Strasbourg - 1935) was a French politician, mayor of Strasbourg from 1919 to 1929.[1] The young Jacques Peirotes, son of a carpenter working at the locomotives factory of Graffenstaden, learned the job of typographer while entering into politics. Since 1900, he was editor of the Freie Presse (Free Press) that was an organ of the Strasbourgian Social Democratic Party which he joined in 1895. In 1902, he became its political manager. In 1913, the newspaper was printed in 9,500 units. He came into the town council of Strasbourg in 1902 and was elected councilman of the southern canton of the Kreis Straburg (Stadt) (arrondissement of Strasbourg-Ville) in 1903. He also was deputy in the second room of the Landtag of the Reichsland Elsass-Lothringen from 1911 to 1918 and deputy of Kolmar in the Reichstag in 1912. When the First World War broke out, he was exiled by German authorities into Hanover and designated as Banned from Alsace. He made publish Neutral oder Franzsisch (Neutral or French). When he came back at the end of the war, he had the skill to neutralize the soldiers and workers councils. He sat as president of the Municipal Commission of Strasbourg from November 1029, 1918. On November 10, 1918 he proclaimed the forfeiture of the German Empire and the advent of the French Republic. He asked to the French authorities to hasten the troops arrival which ended the troubles inspired by anarchist communism.[2] Elected mayor of Strasbourg in 1919 and reelected in 1925, he created a 'municipal office for cheap accommodations' which built 3,000 social apartments in ten years. He was beaten in the 1929 election by a coalition of communists and autonomists that led Charles Hueber to the town hall. This article is a translation of the similar article in the French Wikipedia.
