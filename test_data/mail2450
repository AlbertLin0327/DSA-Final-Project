During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the Royal Navy made use of a considerable number of hired armed vessels. These were generally smaller vessels, often cutters and luggers, that the Navy used for duties ranging from carrying despatches and passengers to convoy escort, particularly in British coastal waters, and reconnaissance.[1] The Navy Board usually hired the vessel complete with master and crew rather than bareboat. Contracts were for a specified time or on an open-ended monthly hire basis.[1] During periods of peace, such as the period between the Treaty of Amiens and the commencement of the Napoleonic Wars, the Admiralty returned the vessels to their owners, only to rehire many on the outbreak of war. The Admiralty provided a regular naval officer, usually a lieutenant for the small vessels, to be the commander. The civilian master then served as the sailing master.[1] For purposes of prize money or salvage, hired armed vessels received the same treatment as naval vessels. That said, Admiral John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent wrote that throughout his life he "discouraged any friend of mine from serving in a cutter or hired armed vessel."[2] He felt that a good officer would be wasting his time in such vessels, while a bad officer should not be allowed to serve in them. Cutters and hired armed vessels generally did not receive the sort of opportunities that would allow a good officer to shine, or give him visibility to senior officers, while giving bad officers too much independence. The most suitable officers were good sailors with a common education.[2] In 1801, the Royal Navy had some 130 hired armed vessels on its rolls. Of these, 12 were ship-rigged, 12 were brig-rigged, and most of the rest were cutters. All but eight served in home waters.[3] During the period roughly 1804 to 1807, the vessels were sometimes referred to as, for example, His Majesty's armed defence ship Indefatigable, which recaptured the Melcombe on 21 June 1804,[4] or hired armed defence-ship Norfolk. Despite St Vincent's strictures, some of these vessels had military careers as distinguished as those of the Royal Navy's own vessels. For instance, between 1796 and 1801, the hired armed cutter Telemachus captured eight privateers in the Channel. Furthermore, some vessels qualified for clasps to the Naval General Service Medal (1847). Noteworthy examples include: In each of these cases, the clasp bore the vessel's own name. Some of these hired armed vessels also sailed under a letter of marque, either before (e.g. the Duke of York) or after (e.g., the Kitty) their service with the Royal Navy.
