The Hardy Rocks (6616S 6717W / 66.267S 67.283W / -66.267; -67.283Coordinates: 6616S 6717W / 66.267S 67.283W / -66.267; -67.283) are insular rocks lying 2 nautical miles (4km) west of DuBois Island, in the Biscoe Islands of Antarctica. They were mapped from air photos taken by the Falkland Islands and Dependencies Aerial Survey Expedition (195657), and were named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee for James D. Hardy, an American physiologist who has studied the reactions of the human body to cold environments.[1] This article incorporatespublic domain material from the United States Geological Survey document "Hardy Rocks" (content from the Geographic Names Information System).
