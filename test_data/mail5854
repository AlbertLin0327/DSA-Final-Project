Conan the Indomitable is a fantasy novel written by Steve Perry featuring Robert E. Howard's seminal sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was first published in trade paperback by Tor Books in October 1989; a regular paperback edition followed from the same publisher in September 1990. Conan and his companion Elashi stumble on a stranger underground realm inhabited by blind apes, one-eyed monsters and giant worms in thrall to a witch and warlock. Their coming upsets the local balance of power. Various complications ensue, including a revolt of the enslaved creatures and the necessity of slaying their masters, before Conan can win his way back to the surface world. One of the cyclops and worms are featured sympathetically in a subplot. Internal evidence indicates that Perry's earlier Conan work Conan the Defiant directly precedes this novel, though in the comprehensive Conan chronology of William Galen Gray, Sean A. Moore's Conan the Hunter is placed between the two books. Writing on one of Perry's other novels, reviewer Ryan Harvey assessed the author's Conan corpus as "goofy," noting that he "has a reputation among Conan fandom for overkill and general silliness."[1]
