New York's Seventh Congressional District is a congressional district for the United States House of Representatives in New York City. Until 2012 it consisted of parts of Northern Queens and Eastern portions of the Bronx. The Queens portion includes the neighborhoods of College Point, East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights and Woodside. The Bronx portion of the district includes the neighborhoods of Co-op City, Morris Park, Parkchester, Pelham Bay, and Throgs Neck as well as City Island. It has been represented by Democrat Joseph Crowley since 1999. 2012-present: 19932012: 1953-1993: 1913-1953: The 7th District originally was the south Queens seat in the 1960s and 1970s (now the 6th District) and then became a central Queens seat (essentially the old 8th district) in the 1980s. Following the 1992 remap, much of the old 9th District was added. The 2002 remap placed much of the district in the Bronx, and it now resembles the 1970s era 10th District. Note that in New York State electoral politics there are numerous minor parties at various points on the political spectrum. Certain parties will invariably endorse either the Republican or Democratic candidate for every office, hence the state electoral results contain both the party votes, and the final candidate votes (Listed as "Recap").
