98000989 Hubbardston Public Library is a historic library at 7 Main Street in Hubbardston, Massachusetts. The Hubbardston Public Library was founded in 1872, and originally housed its collection of books in the local Mechanics Hall. In 1874, Jonas G. Clark, a native of Hubbardston and founder of Clark University, purchased the Main Street Property and funded the construction of the brick and stone library building. The building is in the Second Empire/Italianate style and was designed by Elbridge Boyden and Son, of Worcester. It was built in 1874. In September 1875, the Hubbardston Public Library opened the doors at its 7 Main Street location, where you can find it today. The first floor was originally half library, half post office, hence the pained plaques you might notice flanking the front door. The gallery level was added to the rear of the building in 1929. Many residents recall the gallery's original translucent glass floor. In 1998 the library was added to the National Historic Register. The property underwent a historical restoration project in 2000 to address many of its needed repairs and is looking quite grand for its age of 128 years. The present day library serves the Town by providing a wide variety of materials, services, and events. Best selling books, videos, books on tape and magazines are available to loan. Internet access is available to the public as well as access to the CWMARS resource-sharing catalog. For a small fee, the public may use the copy machine and fax machine.
