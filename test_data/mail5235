Junejo (Urdu: ) is the name of a Samma Sindhi Rajput tribe in Sindh and in some parts of India mostly in Rajasthan. Among the Sindhi Hindu community Juneja is a common surname and many Juneja people originally from Sindh migrated to India during the independence in 1947. Junejo are also known as Jam in some circles. They are mostly involved in agriculture-related industries and the political arena. Junejos are the descendants of Jam Juno, brother of Jam Tamachi also an avid lover of Noori (Sindhi folklore, see Noori Jam Tamachi) who became King of Sindh after Jam Tamachi. Jam Tamachi and Jam Juno fought and those who were in favour (sons and followers alike) of Jam Juno came to be known as Junejo. Junejo literally means Sons of Juno; Jo means 'of' in Sindhi and June refers to 'Jam Juno' meaning descendants of Jam Juno, they belonged originally to dadu, thatta and badin side. Jam Sunjar was king of Sindh and his direct family history connects to Junejo tribe.Junejo tribe are also situated in tunia near lehri district sibbi.Two brothers migrated from Thar,one settled in Dera Bugti,called junejo bugti, and second brother migrated to "TUNIA" a village near city Lehri. In India, the Juneja are found mainly in the districts of Amerli, Rajkot and Kutch, all in Gujarat. They speak a dialect of Kutchi, which has several Sindhi loanwords. A good many are Maldhari pastoral nomads found in the Banni region of Kutch.
