Darker Days Ahead is the second album by Terrorizer. It was released in 2006 on Century Media, seventeen years after their 1989 debut World Downfall. Darker Days Ahead is Terrorizer's final album recorded with guitarist, Jesse Pintado, who died five days after its release due to liver failure. The album has been received coldly because of the non-classic line up and the overall sound, which leans more on death metal than grindcore.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
