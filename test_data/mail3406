Jonathan Nott (born 25 December 1962, Solihull, England) is an English conductor, the son of a priest[1] at Worcester Cathedral[2]. He was a music student and choral scholar at the University of Cambridge, and also studied singing and flute in Manchester at the Royal Northern College of Music. Nott was also a conducting student in London.[3] He left London to develop his conducting career in Germany via the traditional Kapellmeister system.[1] Nott made his conducting debut in 1988 at the Opera Festival in Battignano, Italy. In 1989, he was appointed Kapellmeister at the Frankfurt Opera. In 1991, he was appointed Erster Kapellmeister at the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden, and became interim chief conductor for the 199596 season.[2] He later became music director at the Lucerne Theatre and served as principal conductor of the Lucerne Symphony Orchestra from 1997 to 2002. With the Berlin Philharmonic, Nott recorded several orchestral works of Gyrgy Ligeti as part of the Teldec contribution to the complete recorded works of Ligeti.[4][5][6] Nott became music director of the Ensemble InterContemporain (EIC) in 2000. He relinquished this post in 2003, and immediately took up the position of principal guest conductor of the EIC.[1] He has held that title since then. Nott became principal conductor of the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra in January 2000. With the orchestra, he made his New York City conducting debut.[7] Several years after his 2009 contract extension through the 2011-2012 season[8], in 2011, Nott and the orchestra agreed on a further extension of his contract with the Bamberg Symphony through the 2015-2016 season.[9] Nott and his wife Helen have three children.[6]
