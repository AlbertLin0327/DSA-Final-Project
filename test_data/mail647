GE Consumer & Industrial is a subsidiary of General Electric headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky at Appliance Park. GE Consumer & Industrial is one of the largest suppliers of appliances in the world. It was created in January 2004 when GE Consumer Products merged with GE Industrial Systems. Appliance Park has its own zip code, 40225. In 1951 construction began in Louisville, Kentucky on Appliance Park, the 1,000-acre (4.0km2) manufacturing facility that would eventually employ 25,000 full-time employees. The remaining buildings are Product Support Operations (PSO) or often referred to as the "Back 40." At the start of the park, Appliance Park was a self-sufficient city that provided for its own needs. Until recently it had its own post office staffed by United States Postal Service employees to handle the complex's high volume of mail. GE utilized its own landfill on approximately 20 acres (81,000 m2) from the early 1950s until the mid 1980s when the EPA started enforcing stricter policies for big companies. In order to decrease operational expenses at Appliance Park, a recycling initiative was introduced in December, 2006[citation needed]. In addition to cutting costs, this initiative aims to make the site more environmentally friendly. Major waste streams include cardboard, wooden pallets, metals, electronics, and plastics. Waste office paper will be recycled through the Metro Louisville's "Office Paper Recycling Program". Proceeds will benefit BrightSide, a city beautification campaign initiated by former Metro Louisville Mayor Jerry Abramson. The firefighters, EMS, Haz-Mat, and security force is the only one of its kind left in GE. The force patrols the park for safety hazards 365 days a year. They have a 21-member force with KY certified EMTs protecting the park. At one time the guard force was at 70 members but has drastically been reduced over the last 20 years to coincide with Appliance Park.
