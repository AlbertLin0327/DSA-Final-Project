This Means War! is the tenth release of the Christian rock band, Petra. It was released in 1987. In this album, the band started to refine their movement into a more hard rock/arena rock sound, still retaining keyboard synthesizers to back the driving guitar work. This album also signaled the beginning of a military motif present in the song lyrics that the band would carry through several of their following albums. All songs written by Bob Hartman, except where noted.
