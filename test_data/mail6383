Sotae Station is a subway station on Line 1 of the Gwangju Subway in Dong-gu, Gwangju, South Korea. It is named after the Sotae Valley, a large valley of Mudeungsan. It encompasses a circuit road that reduces traffic congestion caused by heavy traffic volume entering this area from Hwasun, parking lots, and bike parking lots near the station. It is designed to enhance pedestrian safety by securing 3.5~5 meter-wide sidewalks on both sides of the roads. It is a control station in charge of Jeungsimsa Station and Dolgogae Station.[1] Coordinates: 350725N 1265557E / 35.12361N 126.9325E / 35.12361; 126.9325
