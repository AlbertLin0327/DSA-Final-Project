Lucius Valerius Messalla Volesus was a Roman Senator during the reign of Emperor Augustus. He also served as a triumvir for the Roman mint, proconsul of the Roman province of Asia, and was a consul in the year 5 AD. His father, Potitus Valerius Messala, was a suffect consul and prefect of the city of Rome. During the latter part of his career, he was charged with crimes against humanity and found guilty.[1] Although it has yet to be discovered, Augustus wrote of the fall of Lucius Valerius in his book, de Voleso Messala.[2]
