Scipione Piattoli (November 10, 1739  April 12, 1809) was an Italian Catholic priesta Piaristan educator, writer and political activist. After ten years as a professor at the University of Modena in Italy, he migrated to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, where he became associated with several magnate familiesthe Potockis, Lubomirskis and Czartoryskis. He was politically active in Warsaw during and after the Four-Year Sejm (178892). He served as intermediary between the reformist Patriotic Party and King Stanisaw August Poniatowski, and as an aide to the King (178993). He is best remembered for his participation in drafting the Constitution of May 3, 1791. He was also involved in preparations for the Kociuszko Insurrection. After the Third Partition of Poland, he was interned by the Austrians for several years, together with Hugo Kotaj. Freed in 1800, he worked several years with Adam Jerzy Czartoryski in the service of Russia, before retiring to Courland. Scipione Piattoli was born November 10, 1749 in Florence to a family of painters (father, Gaetano Piattoli; mother, Maria Anna Bacherini; brother, Giuseppe Piattoli).[1] In 1763 he joined the Piarist order, taking the name Urban.[1] Some historians have questioned whether he ever took Holy Orders; in any case he was known for a rather secular lifestyle.[1][2] He taught rhetoric in Piarist schools in Messa and Corregio, and got his doctorate from the University of Florence.[1] From 1772 to 1782 he was a professor at the University of Modena, teaching religious history and Greek.[3] Soon he became involved in political activism, and in 1774 he published (anonymously) a brochure Saggio attorno al luogo del sepellire, focusing on the issue of hygiene and burials near churches.[1] Also in 1774 he received permission to leave the Piarists, and resumed using the name Scipione.[1] He would, however, keep and use the title of the priest (l'abbe) for most of his life.[1] By the turn of the decade, Piattoli found himself in a faction that was losing in the politics in Modena, and decided to move, giving up his professorship in 1782.[1] Piattoli arrived in Poland (the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) that year, as a tutor for the Potocki family (the sons of Piotr Potocki).[1] It was said in a contemporary account that his entire material wealth at that time was composed of a sizable library.[1] He ended his service with the family around 1784 due to personal disagreements (with Pelagia Potocka and Maria Radziwi).[4] In the meantime, he became associated with the Lubomirski family (in particular, Izabela Lubomirska), and through them, a friend of Stanisaw Kostka Potocki and Grzegorz Piramowicz.[4] Through Potocki and Piramowicz he became a member of the Society for Elementary Books (in 1784).[4] In the Society he was tasked with writing a textbook on the history of science.[4] Around that time he was also active in the Warsaw freemasonry.[4] Piattoli traveled through Europe in the retinue of the Lubomirski family, including Izabela, and as a tutor of Henryk Lubomirski.[4] During that time he developed extensive contacts at various European courts in Courland, Austria (Vienna), Italy (Turin) and France (Paris).[3][4] During his three year stay in Paris, in the Lubomirskis' residence there, he was in touch with many people of the Age of Enlightenment.[4] He met  often through another Florentinian, Filippo Mazzei - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Thomas Jefferson, Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette, Luigi Landriani, Girolamo Lucchesini, and Marquis de Condorcet, and corresponded with J. G. Herder.[4] From the notable Polish figures, he became associated with Ignacy Potocki and Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz.[4] He also tutored Adam Jerzy Czartoryski (from 1787), later an important politician in the Russian Empire, on whom he would have significant influence throughout his life.[4][5] Through his contacts he became involved with notable figures on the Polish political scene, initially from the group opposed to the royal faction.[4] By the end of his stay in Paris, he likely became a supporter of reforms in France and Poland, and begun taking his first serious steps in political activism, through the involvement in the Quattuowirat, a group of magnates planning a (never realized) confederacy.[4] He became a foreign member of the Socit des Amis des Noirs.[4] Piattoli, through his freemason contacts with Pierre Maurice Glayre, won the confidence of Poland's King Stanisaw August Poniatowski, becoming his agent in Paris, and by the end of 1789, his private secretary and librarian, without, however, any official title.[6][7] Acting as a sort of cultural aide, Piattoli, having strong ties to the reformist and often anti-royal opposition, became an important link between the reformers (in particular, Ignacy Potocki) and the king.[7][8] In the words of a Swedish diplomat, L. Engstrom, he was like a tireless spring, constantly mediating between the two factions.[8] Due to his association with the reformers, in conservative Rome he became infamous as a staunch supporter of revolutionary ideals and was accused of "democratism". Vatican diplomats criticized the king for hiring such a "revolutionary", without much success because the king defended Piattoli quite vividly.[7] In any case, much of this was an exaggeration of rumours spread by his political enemies: according to one such rumour, Piattoli was supposed to incite crowds in France to kill the king.[7][9] In reality, Piattoli supported the Monarciens of the French Revolution's early stages, but more in the direction of peaceful transformation into a constitutional republic than the regicide excesses.[7] In the period 179092 he was sent on several sensitive diplomatic missions for the king to Berlin and other places.[6][10][11] He was involved in the negotiations of the Polish-Prussian alliance.[10] He collaborated with Ignacy Potocki, helping draft many texts connected with Potocki's work in the Sejm, the legislature of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.[8][6] He was also actively supporting Poniatowski's plan for a hereditary succession.[8] Piattoli, as secretary to King Stanislas and a resident of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, has been credited with having won the King over to the idea of social reforms and with having played a role in the drafting of the Constitution of May 3, 1791.[12] The exact nature of Piattoli's role in regard to the Constitution remains uncertain; modern historians still are unsure to what degree he was an executor, a mediator, and an initiator.[10][12] He played a role in winning the King over to collaboration with the leaders of the Patriotic Party on drafting a constitution. He might have prepared or expanded drafts of the document, based on discussions among the principal authors, including the King, Hugo Kotaj (another politically active Roman Catholic priest) and Ignacy Potocki.[13][12] At a minimum, he seems to have helped catalyze the process.[12] Rostworowski describes him as a vital secretary-editor, who certainly participated in related discussions and influenced both Potocki and the king, and calls his quarters in the Royal Palace a creche of the constitution.[8][10] He was, finally, involved in the final preparations for the vote that took place on 3 May.[10] Soon afterward he became a founder of the Friends of the Constitution.[10] He was active in various political causes and worked closely with other key figures in Poland such as Hugo Kotaj.[10] He became a trusted adviser to Dorothea von Medem, Duchess of Courland.[10] He supported reforms to improve the status of the burghers and Jews.[10] During the War in Defence of the Constitution, he found himself on another diplomatic mission to Dresden, where he stayed after the Commonwealth defeat.[11] He was active there, and in nearby Leipzig, in the circles of Polish patriotic emigres, who included Potocki and Koltaj.[11][14] In 1793 he officially parted ways with Poniatowski, receiving a letter in which he was discharged from his service.[11] In 1794 he was involved in the preparations for the Kociuszko Insurrection, and in negotiations with the newly republican France, in which Polish reformists proposed an alliance with France, promising to turn Poland into a second republic in Europe.[14][15] At the same time, he was involved in much more conservative negotiations with Russians.[14][15] In July 1794 he and several other activists were exiled from Leipzig, and he was soon arrested by the Austrian authorities.[15] After the failure of the uprising, when many other prisoners were set free, he was kept imprisoned, together with Kotaj, as the Russian authorities insisted that the two were extremely dangerous.[15] Hence, after the final Partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, he was interned by the Austrian Empire authorities in Prague in 1800, despite requests for his release from Poniatowski and even Napoleon Bonaparte.[3][15] His release in 1800 seems to have been the result of efforts of the Czartoryski family, and Duchess Dorothea.[15] After his release he returned to Dorothea's Courland court, where he served as a tutor for her daughter/[15] Around 1803 he became increasingly more involved with Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, who now worked for the Russian authorities.[15] Around that time Piattoli, together with Czartoryski, authored a plan for a European federal organization of states intended to prevent armed conflicts and maintain perpetual peace.[6][16][15][17] Piattoli, through Czartoryski, briefly worked in the diplomatic service and admnistration of the Russians, too.[6][3][17] Like Czartoryski, Piattoli tried to push for a more lenient and friendly attitude towards Poland at the Russian court, but with little success.[17] In 1807 he returned to Courland.[18] There he finally settled, abandoned the priesthood, and married one of the ladies of the court.[6][3][18] In his final years in Courland he was involved with Courland's educational system, and hoped to pursue some scientific studies, a dream of his life he never found enough time for.[18] He died, with a lung infection, in Altenburg on 12 April 1809.[18] He was buried in the park in Lbichau.[18] Piattoli was an inspiration to Leo Tolstoy. The author based the figure of the Abb Morio in War and Peace on him.[16][18] Emanuel Rostworowski, in his 1980 ten-page entry on Piattoli in the Polish Biographical Dictionary, notes that, despite two Italian monographs (by A.D. Ancon and G. Bozzolato), Piattoli still awaits a definitive biography.[18]
