Uwe Kamps (born 12 June 1964 in Dsseldorf) is a retired German footballer who played as a goalkeeper.[1] Kamps joined Borussia Mnchengladbach from amateur outfit BV 04 Dsseldorf. On 2 April 1983, he made his first team debut, starting in a 50 home success against Karlsruher SC, and finished his debut season in the Bundesliga with 12 appearances and 20 conceded, including four in the season's final round, a 46 triumph at Borussia Dortmund. After three additional seasons with only three matches combined, Kamps became the side's undisputed starter, going on to amass 390 first division games. In 199192, he lost the German Cup final to Hannover 96, after a legendary semifinal against Bayer 04 Leverkusen where he saved all four penalties from the opposition (Martin Kree, Ioan Lupescu, Heiko Herrlich and Jorginho). Kamps would start and win the same competition in 1995, after a 30 final win over VfL Wolfsburg. Kamps remained in Borussia's books until 200304. He was influential in the club's 2001 return to the top level, after one year of absence, but only played one game in his final three seasons, barred by Swiss international Jrg Stiel. Kamps is currently the goalkeeping coach at Borussia Mnchengladbach.
