Northland Village Mall is a shopping centre in northwest Calgary, Alberta. Northland Village is a two level shopping centre with over 81 retail shops and services. It is located at the intersection of Crowchild Trail and Shaganappi Trail, in the neighbourhoods of Brentwood and Dalhousie and immediately north of the University of Calgary research park. The mall hosts the anchor stores Best Buy, Future Shop, and Wal-Mart; as well as other large format retailers including Winners, Fabricland, Home Outfitters, Home Furnishing, La-Z-Boy, Designer Depot and Kincaid. It is a regional mall with 510,000 square feet (47,000 m2) of Gross leasable area.[1] Northland Village underwent renovations in 2005, when it hosted Calgary's first Designer Depot, the Hudson's Bay Co.'s first off-price retail store location in Western Canada.[2] Other stores include Crown Optical, The Source, Stitches, Lenscrafters, Rogers Wireless, Bell Mobility, and Peoples Jewellers. The mall had an Eaton's department store location as one of its anchors until the late 1990s when the chain collapsed. The closure of Eaton's occurred at a time when it was spearheading a planned expansion and renovation at Northland Village; eventually, the now-vacated department store was converted into several stores, including Future Shop, Winners and Fabricland, with a small second level of the mall added in this area along with a modest parkade. In the mid-2000s, a further expansion saw the addition of Home Outfitters and Best Buy, despite the latter being owned by, and offering much the same products, as Future Shop just down the mall. In the early 2000s, a high-end grocery market survived in the mall for only a couple of years before being replaced by a succession of furniture operations, and more recently as the first Calgary location of Target Canada (a different operation from the US-based department store chain). Like many Calgary malls, Northland Village had a movie theatre for many years, before the trend became for theatres to vacate shopping centre for standalone facilities; Gold's Gym now occupies the former theatre site. It is the recipient of a 1998 MAXI Award [3] for their program to help the impoverished adults[4] As of early 2010, the mall has a number of noticeable vacancies, with at least one shop having left the mall in favour of CrossIron Mills.
