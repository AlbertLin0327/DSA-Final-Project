The roughly 26 million inhabitants of Syria are an overall indigenous Levantine people. While modern-day Syrians are commonly described as Arabs by virtue of their modern-day language and bonds to Arab culture and history, they are, in fact, largely a blend of the various Aramaic speaking groups indigenous to the region who were Arabized when Muslim Arabs from the Arabian Peninsula arrived and settled following the Arab expansion. During colonial years, the region had a fairly large minority of French settlers. Many of them stepped out after the recognition of Syrian independence, but their influence is still evident on fluency of French by the educated class in Syria. Syria's population is 74% Sunni Muslim(includes Turks and most Kurds), and 16% other Muslim groups, including the Alawi, Shi'a, and Druze, and 10% Christian, with a Syrian Jewish community of a few dozen. 1,500 people of Greek descent live in Syria. The majority of them are Syrian citizens.[1] Arabic is the official, and most widely spoken, language. Arabic speakers, including some 400,000 Palestinians, make up 85% of the population. Many educated Syrians also speak English and French. The Kurds, many of whom speak Kurdish, make up 9% [2] of the population and live mostly in the northeast corner of Syria, though sizable Kurdish communities live in most major Syrian cities as well. Armenian and Turkmen are spoken among the small Armenian and Turkmen populations respectively. Neo-Aramaic is still used by Assyrians and in some villages in the Anti-Lebanon mountains. Sixty percent of the population live in the province of Aleppo, the Euphrates valley or along the coastal plain; a fertile strip between the coastal mountains and the desert. Overall population density is about 118.3/km (306.5 per sq. mi.) Education is free and compulsory from ages 6 to 11. Schooling consists of 6 years of primary education followed by a 3-year general or vocational training period and a 3-year academic or vocational program. The second 3-year period of academic training is required for university admission. Total enrollment at post-secondary schools is over 150,000. The literacy rate of Syrians aged 15 and older is 86.0% for males and 73.6% for females.[3] The following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[5] 22,530,746 (July 2012 est.) 014 years: 35.2% (male 4,066,109/female 3,865,817) 1564 years: 61% (male 6,985,067/female 6,753,619) 65 years and older: 3.8% (male 390,802/female 456,336) (2011 est.) total 21.9 years male 21.7 years female 22.1 years (2011 est.) -0.797% (2012 est.) 23.52 births/1,000 population (2012 est.) 3.67 deaths/1,000 population (July 2012 est.) -27.82 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2012 est.) at birth: 1.06 male(s)/female under 15 years: 1.06 male(s)/female 1564 years: 1.05 male(s)/female 65 years and older: 0.89 male(s)/female total population: 1.05 male(s)/female (2009 est.) total population: 71.19 years male: 69.8 years female: 72.68 years (2009 est.) noun: Syrian(s) adjective: Syrian Arabs 90%, other ethnic groups such as Kurds 9%, Assyrians/Syriacs[6], Armenians, Circassians, and Syrian Turkmen 1% [2] Sunni Muslim 74% (includes Turks and most Kurds), Shia Muslim (predominantly Alawites but also including others such as Ismailis) 13%, Christian (various Churches) 10%, Druze 3%.[7][8] Arabic (official); Kurdish, Turkmen, Neo-Aramaic, and Armenian. definition: age 30 and older can read and write total population: 79.6% male: 86.0% female: 73.6% (2004 census) urban population 56% of total population (2010) rate of urbanization 2.5% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)
