She Changes is a sculpture designed by artist Janet Echelman for the cities of Porto and Matosinhos, Northern Portugal. The installation consists of three steel poles, cables, a 20-ton steel ring, and a net structure of varying densities and colors.[1] The sculpture is Echelman's first permanent public art installation. It is also the official graphic symbol of the cities of Matosinhos and Porto. The installation had a budget of USD 1.6 million. The sculpture is designed to reflect Porto's and Matosinhos's sea-faring and industrial heritage. The three support poles are painted to resemble the smokestacks and lighthouses in the area. The net structure is meant to reference the city's fishing industry.[2] The three support poles range in height from 2550m in order to hang the 20-ton, 45m diameter steel ring at an angle to the ground. The net is woven together from 36 individual sections of varying densities, which give the net its shape. The net material is made of TENARA architectural fiber, a UV-resistant material made of PTFE.
