Romani and Croatian Christianity Sunni Islam Roma are an ethnic group in Croatia for more than 600 years and they are concentrated mostly in the northern regions of the country. In the 2001 census, there were 9,463 Roma in Croatia or 0.2% of the population, more than half of whom were located in the Meimurje County and the City of Zagreb.[1][5] Various estimates place the actual Roma population at 30,000-40,000,[2][3][4] with some up to 60,000.[2] A considerable number of Roma refugees in Croatia from the ethnic conflict in Bosnia.[citation needed] Various Roma groups have lived in Croatia since the 14th century.[4] Many Croatian Roma, as well as members of other minority groups like Serbs and Jews, were murdered by the ustasha during the Second World War.[6] In the Republic of Croatia, Roma have remained largely marginalized, so the government has a programme to provide them with systematic assistance in order to improve their living conditions and to include them in the social life.[3][4] In the Croatian parliamentary election, 2007, the Roma minority elected their first dedicated member of Croatian Parliament. In 2010, Roma were added to the preamble of the Croatian Constitution and thereby recognized as one of the autochthonous national minorities.[7] They elect a special representative to the Croatian Parliament shared with members of eleven other national minorities.[8] The most important Roma organization is the Croatian Roma Union.
