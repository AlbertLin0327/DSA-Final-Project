Breidtinden (also Northern Sami: Reaiddaidohkka[1]) is the highest mountain on the island Senja in Troms county, Norway. It is located in the northeastern part of the municipality of Berg, just east of the Mefjorden and the village of Mefjordbotn. The lake Svartholvatnet is located just to the south of the mountain.[2]
