The Necanicum River is river on the Pacific coast of northwest Oregon in the United States, approximately 21 miles (34km) long. It drains a timber-producing area of the Northern Oregon Coast Range northwest of Portland. It forms the first estuary south of the mouth of the Columbia River along the Oregon Coast. The Necanicum River rises south of Humbug Mountain (not to be confused with the Humbug Mountain in southwestern Oregon), in south central Clatsop County and south of the Saddle Mountain State Natural Area. The elevation of the river's source is approximately 1,580 feet (480m).[2] It flows generally west, along U.S. Route 26. Approximately 3 miles (4.8km) from the coast, east of Tillamook Head, it turns north. The river enters the Pacific Ocean at Seaside. Its final approach to the ocean is nearly parallel to the coast, bisecting the city of Seaside south to north. Neacoxie Creek flowing in from the north, draining Clatsop Plains, is the last tributary before the river enters the ocean. At one time, Cullaby Lake and Cullaby Creek drained into the river via the Neacoxie. The Clatsop Canal Project  Carnahan Ditch changed this and they now train into the Skipanon River.
