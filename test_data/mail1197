Big Brother Africa 6 (also known as Big Brother Africa: Amplified) is the sixth season of the Big Brother Africa reality television series produced by Endemol for M-Net which began airing on May 1, 2011 and run for 91 days until July 31, 2011. This year Mnet co-partnered with Cocacola for the series. IK returned as host for the series. The launch show was also broadcasted live through the official website. This year the contestants will move into a brand new house. South African band BLKJKS (Blackjacks) performed their song 'Mzabalazo'; Busta Rhymes also performed during the 2 hour launch show. 26 contestants entered the house on May 1 although they all may not become housemates; there will be challenges to determine who will stay in the house. On day 7 all the housemates passed. All of them were removed from the house, 15 rentered the main "Heads House" while the other 11 entered the "Tails House". On day 42, it was announced that there will be 2 winners winning USD 200 000 each this year. 7 housemates vied for the grandprize during the final week of voting in which two became the winners, Karen & Wendall. Big Brother Amplified was broadcast live 24/7 starting with a 2 hour Launch show at 19:00 CAT on Sunday 1 May, 2011 ending with a finish of the 2 hour Grand Finale at 21:00 CAT on Sunday 31 July, 2011 on DStv Channel 198 everyday of the 91 days. Channel 198 provided 2 live feeds direct from the Big Brother house once again, giving viewers a choice of watching which feed they like by changing from one feed to the other; an innovation introduced in season 5. The Launch was aired live online for the first time on Big Brother Africa starting at 18:45 CAT on Sunday 1 May, 2011. All Prime Time episodes of edited Daily and Weekly Highlights, Nomination and Eviction shows premiered during M-Net's prime time slot before showing on other channels which included Africa Magic, Mzansi Magic and Magic World. M-Net Schedule: Nomination shows aired live on Mondays at 20:00 CAT. (30 min.) Daily shows aired from Tuesday to Friday at 19:30 CAT. (30 min.) Weekly Highlights aired on Saturdays at 20:00 CAT.

Twists Breaking the tradition of keeping housemates' identity a secret until the launch show, Mnet revealed 14 housemates 3 days before the launch. Only 1 of these 14 did not make it into the house. 13 other housemates were revealed during the live launch show on 1 May. This year half of the housemates are celebrities. On the premiere, all the 26 housemates entered one house. On day 7, they were all removed from the house and joined the host- IK on stage inside the live audience studio during the Sunday night live show. Each housemate picked a glove randomly from a bag containing 26 gloves of different colors. The fate of the housemates depends on the color of their glove. 15 housemates with same colored gloves returned to the initial house which was later on called "Heads", the remaining 11 housemates were led to a destination which turned out to be another house called "Tails". From day 35, evicted housemates throw a "Fuse" to the remaining housemates. The Fuse is a punishment done by a housemate in a week. The Fuse is similar to the "Molotov Cocktail"(in season 4;The Revolution) and the "Dagger"(in season 5; All Stars). Two Winners (USD 400 000 up for grabs) In an unpredictable twist of the season, On day 42 it was announced that there will not be only 1 winner as always but there will be 2 winners each receiving the USD 200 000 grand prize as planned, while the twist is revealed to the viewers, all housemates do not know anything about this until they are out. This is the first time in Africa for a reality show to give away USD 400 000 prize money. It is also the first time to have 2 winners on one Big Brother season. Nominations Every housemate is entitled to nominate 2 fellow housemates for eviction when requested by Big Brother in the Chat room(Diary room) this decision should remain a secret between the housemate and Big Brother. The head of house may also be nominated. If a housemate reveals their nominations to fellow housemates, they will be put up for possible eviction. Big Brother will announce the most nominated housemates to the house on Monday night during the live nomination show. The head of house is then called to the Chat room to save one housemate from nominations list and replace them with another housemate of the head of house's choice. While the decision is revealed to the voting public, the head of house must keep it as a secret until when they are asked to reveal the swap on the live eviction show on Sunday night. If the head of house reveals the swap without Big Brother's permission they will be penalised by being put up for possible eviction. Task Wager Housemates will wager a certain percentage(25% or 50% or 75% or 100%) of their weekly budget with Big Brother on their weekly task. Housemates will win their wager only if they are committed to the task and will be given extra "Decibels"(Big Brother currency) on their weekly budget to buy luxury items such as cigarettes, perfumes, e.t.c. Friday Night Arena On Fridays, housemates are blindfolded and leave the house for the nearby Big Brother Arena of Fun and Games. There are different games set for housemates each and every week. Saturday Night Live On Saturday nights, there is the popular live house party with ChannelO's The 411. The party with different themes each week brings the hottest DJs out of Africa on the decks live from the Big Brother house. The party is simulcast live on the biggest music television station in Africa, M-Net's ChannelO. Eviction The most anticipated eviction show is on Sunday nights. As on day 14 and 21, all the nominated housemates joined the host- IK on stage in the studio packed with an audience outside the Big Brother house. Surviving housemates returned to the house and the evicted housemates were left outside. Amplified Crew The Amplified Crew is a Hip-Hop Dance Group which performs at Big Brother Amplified Live Shows on Sunday nights. The group is an addition to the show this year to make the season more amplified. Viewers Competition There is a viewers voting competition every week in partnership with Samsung.

It's a showcase of pop culture, filled with interesting contrasts and dynamic wall art while remaining a light filled space that is welcoming and warm. In addition, there are mirrors which act as camera windows almost everywhere, making the house a fully fledged studio. There are two houses side by side called Heads and Tails.

Vina was the first one evicted followed by Hanni and then IK made a surprising announcement when he asked the top 5 to leave the house together and join him on stage in the studio where all evicted housemates were together with family and friends of the finalists and other fans. One by one the top 5 left the stage until only Karen and Wendall remained as they were surprised with the announcement that both won the USD 200 000 top price each.
