Borden Farm is a neighbourhood in Nepean, Ontario built on the site of the former Borden Dairy Farm. The Borden farm community was built in 1969 and features single family homes with parks and bikeways placed behind the houses, instead of on the streets. One of the housing developments found alongside the Borden Farm neighbourhood is Fisher Glen, built in the 1980s. Coordinates: 452105N 754321W / 45.351391N 75.722451W / 45.351391; -75.722451
