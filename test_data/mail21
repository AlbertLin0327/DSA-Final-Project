The document was written on 7 October 590. Currently it is housed in the Egyptian Museum (10051) in Cairo.[1] The document is a receipt showing that Phoebammon, a butler, had paid 3.5 jars of wine "to the 14 bucellarii of Heracleopolis and Koma who had come on account of the fight..."[2] The measurements of the fragment are 63 by 322 mm.[2] It was discovered by Grenfell and Hunt in 1897 in Oxyrhynchus.
