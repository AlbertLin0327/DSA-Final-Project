Birlapur (Bengali: ) is a census town under Nadakhali police station of Alipore sadar subdivision in South 24 Parganas district in the state of West Bengal, India.[1] As of 2001[update] India census,[2] Birlapur had a population of 19,830.

Birlapur was founded by Mr. M.P.Birla. He established different factories here. Birlapur is famous for the Birla Jute Mill.There are one Calsium carbite factory, one linonium factory, one jute fibre factory and auto trim factory also. There is a co-educational high school named Birlapur Vidyalaya with both Hindi and Bengali medium. There is a permanent market also. The factory has its power house. Most of the employees stay in company provided quarters. It is a place for many Birla employees and their children who spent most of their childhood in this serene and peaceful urban village. In the recent years, Birlapur has seen lots of financial crisis as most of the factories are closing down, however, it is a great place to live and raise your children. Birlapur needs an eye of a new investor for its thriving and successful future, as it used to be in 90's. 222609N 880850E / 22.4358N 88.14729E / 22.4358; 88.14729
