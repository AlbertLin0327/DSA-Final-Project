J. D. Watt (born May 25, 1987) is a Canadian professional ice hockey winger who currently plays with the Ontario Reign. The native of Cremona, Alberta was originally drafted by the Flames in the 4th round (111th overall) of the 2005 NHL Entry Draft.[1] Watt is known for his abrasive style of play as an agitator.[2] A native of Cremona, Alberta, Watt played Junior A hockey with the Drumheller Dragons of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL) in 200304 before joining the major junior ranks with the Vancouver Giants of the Western Hockey League (WHL) late in the season. Playing with the Giants, Watt won the 2006 President's Cup and the 2007 Memorial Cup championships. He played for the Red Deer Rebels and the Regina Pats in his final year of major junior. Watt was drafted after his second junior season by his hometown team, the Calgary Flames (Cremona is approximately just 75km outside of Calgary), in the fourth round, 111th overall, in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. In 200809, he was initially assigned to the Flames' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Quad City Flames, but was quickly re-assigned to the Las Vegas Wranglers of the ECHL. On November 9, 2008, he recorded his first professional hat trick and added an assist for a four-point night against the Phoenix RoadRunners in a 6-2 win.[3] Watt was recalled, however, by the Quad City Flames on December 8, 2008.[4] He was suspended by the AHL late in the season for four games on February 24, 2009, after delivering a check to the head in a game against the San Antonio Rampage.[5] On January 5, 2011 the Calgary Flames announced that J.D. Watt's contract has been terminated effective immediately. J.D. notified us on Monday that he was no longer interested in pursuing his career with the Calgary Flames organization, He informed us of his decision and as a result, he was then suspended and cleared unconditional waivers this morning. We are moving forward in the best interests of the hockey club, our players in Abbotsford and the Flames organization." During the 201011 AHL season Watt played 27 games with the Abbotsford Heat, recording one goal and three assists for four points while accumulating 73 penalty minutes.
