The West Cheshire Amateur Football League (commonly known as the West Cheshire League) is an English football league in the county of Cheshire. Their current principal sponsors are Carlsberg, also sponsors of the South West Peninsula League. It has a Division One, Divisions Two and Division Three each consisting of 16 clubs. Division One sits at step 7 (or level 11) of the National League System. If they have floodlights, the league's clubs are eligible for the FA Vase but not the FA Cup, and its champions eligible for promotion to the North West Counties Football League Division One. After several triumphs in Division One, Cammell Laird were promoted to the North West Counties League in 2004, and their reserve team, who had won Division Two, were promoted to the Division One. They were the only team since Vauxhall Motors to be promoted from the league, until Runcorn Town were promoted in 2010. The league also runs cup competitions.
