It used to be called Lukhovichi () until the mid-1920s and after that Lukhovitsy. In 1957, it was granted town status. The town grew rapidly after the transfer of testing (and later production) facilities of the Mikoyan design bureau. The town is served by Lukhovitsy Tretyakovo Airport. Lukhovitsy Bus Terminal is located here. Lukhovitsy is famous for growing cucumbers; there is a monument to cucumber in the town.
