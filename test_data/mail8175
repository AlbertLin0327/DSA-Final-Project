Felix started running at age fifteen. She suffered knee and back injuries which forced her out of competition for two years between 1998 and 2000. She did not know anything about athletics and was not particularly interested in it but she won her first race. "The sensations were extraordinary so I continued with it." Her best senior solo result was finishing 4th in the 200m final at the 2002 European Athletics Championships in Munich. Felix was the 1996 world junior 200m champion. Her occupation is police officer. She is a graduated sociologist. She finished 5th in the 200m final and 7th in the 100m final at the 2006 European Athletics Championships in Gothenburg.
