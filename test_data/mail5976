The Lion was an automobile built in Adrian, Michigan, United States, by the Lion Motor Car Company from 1909-12. The Lion had a four-cylinder 40 hp engine, and was available in at least three body types. The 1912 model cost $1,600 and came equipped with internal expanding brakes with drums of 14-inch (360mm) diameter. A fire in 1912 destroyed 150 cars in the factory, and the company never recovered and closed. The Lion Motor Car Company also produced the Gyroscope.
