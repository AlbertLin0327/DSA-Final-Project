The Trunk Boiz[1] are one of the first rap groups to attain commercial success from the burgeoning scraper bike[2] scene of the Bay Area of California. Their first hit, Scraper Bike,[3] introduced mainstream America to scraper bikes, a distinct type of bicycle (inspired by the scraper car style) ridden in Oakland, California, specifically East Oakland, and became an internet viral, with the Youtube video realising 3 million views by August 2010.
