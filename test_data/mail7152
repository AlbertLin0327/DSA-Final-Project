Born in Council, Idaho, graduated from the University of Idaho in 1960 with a degree in pre-law. He spent one year in law school and then took a break to go on active duty with the U.S. Army.[1] He served in New Jersey and South Korea.[1] Kidwell earned a law degree from the University of Idaho.[1] During law school, he served for a summer as an aide to U.S. Sen.
