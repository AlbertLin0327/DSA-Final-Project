Jorebungalow (also spelt Jorebunglow) is a small locality near the town of Darjeeling in the Indian state of West Bengal. The locality falls under Darjeeling Municipality, Ward No. 1. It has a police station. The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway passes through this locality. This tiny hamlet was one of the most important trading points during the British rule. For most of the tea gardens in the neighbouring areas like Glenbourne, Teesta Valley, etc., Jorebungalow was the storage point for tea leaves to be transported to Calcutta and beyond and to bring back rations and items of daily needs. Even today, Jorebungalow is a strategic place owing to its position connecting Darjeeling town with the rest of India.
