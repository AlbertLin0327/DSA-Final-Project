Wicked is a 1998 American thriller independent film starring Julia Stiles as a disturbed teenager. Troubled teen daughter Ellie (Julia Stiles) assumes the role of her dead mother and takes control of her father's life. Casa Del Norte is a upscale community where Ellie lives with her parents, younger sister and the Swedish au pair. They all hate the au pair except for Dad, who is having an affair with her. So Mom has an affair with the next door neighbor, until she is found bludgeoned to death on the kitchen floor. In a Hitchcockian twist, Ellie's grief gives way to a twisted obsession to become her mother as well as the object of her father's desire. Wicked debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in January 1998. It was shelved until Stiles' career ascendancy and re-released on video in 2001.[citation needed]
