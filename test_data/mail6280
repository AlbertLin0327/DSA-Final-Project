Simon Jones (born 27 July 1950) is an English actor, most famous for his appearances in the television and radio series of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, in which he played the lead role of Arthur Dent from 1978 to 2005. Its author Douglas Adams later said that he wrote the part of Arthur Dent with Simon Jones in mind. He was featured in the 2005 movie adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as a cameo role.[1] As well as The Hitchhiker's Guide, Jones also appeared in various other TV series, including Brideshead Revisited (in which he played the Earl of Brideshead --'Bridey'--, the heir to the Marquess of Marchmain), and the second series of Blackadder (playing Sir Walter Raleigh).

Simon studied at King's College, Taunton before he studied at Cambridge University where he was a member of the Footlights and he met Douglas Adams. This led to Jones being cast in Out of the Trees and later The Hitchhiker's Guide and the film Monty Python's The Meaning of Life. In The Meaning of Life Jones had a minor role as one of the guests at the dinner party. He has also appeared in some of the solo film projects of the members of Monty Python: American Friends, Brazil and 12 Monkeys.

In 2009 he played in Blithe Spirit, as Dr. Bradman, with Angela Lansbury and Rupert Everett. Off-Broadway he has a long list of credits, and was nominated for the 1990 Drama Desk Award Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play for his role in Privates on Parade. In Regional theatre at the Guthrie Theater, Minneapolis, Simon starred as Christopher Gore in the American premier of Brian Friel's The Home Place in late 2007.

The same year he was involved in the filming of the movie version of the first novel, making a brief cameo appearance in the role of the holographic Magrathean answering machine/automated defence system. His 2006 audio book reading of Mitch Cullin's A Slight Trick of the Mind won the Audio Publishers Association's 2006 Audie Award for Unabridged Fiction. He was heard in 2009 as master detective Sexton Blake on BBC Radio 2 in the six-part series, The Adventures of Sexton Blake!.
