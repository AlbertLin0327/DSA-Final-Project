Robin Juhkental (born 20 May 1988 in Tallinn, Estonia) is an Estonian singer.[1][2] He is the frontman of Malcolm Lincoln. Juhkental has studied in Kivime phikool, Tallinna Nmme Gmnaasium and is currently studying road engineering in Tallinn University of Applied Sciences.[2][3] Juhkental has never taken any singing lessons.[3] He has participated in the Kaks takti ette (2007) and Eesti otsib superstaari (2009) television shows as a contestant.[2] Malcolm Lincoln, together with a group of backing vocalists called Manpower 4, won the competition Eesti Laul 2010 with the song "Siren" and represented Estonia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010.[4][5] Juhkental uses a surrealist way of writing song lyrics: first he just babbles, records the nonsense and then starts thinking what words these sounds resemble.[6] His lyrics are mostly in English. He believes that he is not a good enough poet to write lyrics in Estonian, but considers English to be so messy that lyrics written in it will seem less bad than they would in Estonian.[7]
