Bradley Walsh (born 4 June 1960) is an English light entertainer, television actor, comedian and former professional footballer. Walsh rose to fame in the mid 1990s after he became a presenter on The National Lottery. Walsh grew up in Leavesden, near Watford. He attended what is now Francis Combe Academy, a comprehensive school in Garston, Hertfordshire. At school, Walsh showed a particular interest in sports and media, of which both he successfully passed 'O' Levels in. He was also a prominent member of the school's football squad, scoring 64 goals during his tenure.[1] In the late 1970s, at the age of 18, Walsh became a professional football player for Brentford and although he failed to make the first team, he was regularly a member of the reserves. Separate ankle fracture injuries finished his career in the game in the early 80s after a promising loan spell with non-league minnows Dunstable, for whom he scored 15 goals in 25 league appearances. Walsh's time at Brentford also saw him play for Barnet on loan, making five league appearances in the 197879 season. Walsh was at Barnet at the same time as the legendary, renowned player Jimmy Greaves. Walsh first came to prominence on television in 1994, after he won a role as one of the presenting team on the National Lottery, broadcast regularly on Saturday and Wednesday evenings on BBC1. After Walsh became a public favourite, he was quickly snapped up by rival TV channel ITV1, who offered him the role as presenter on one of the network's new game shows, Midas Touch. In 1997, Walsh was asked to front the British adaptation of popular US game show, Wheel of Fortune. Walsh's tenure on Wheel of Fortune lasted just that one year (1997), when he decided to turn his hand to acting. He was succeeded by John Leslie. His first acting job involved a minor role in the Channel 4 TV series, Lock, Stock.... Channel 4 later approached Walsh for a role in their 2001 TV film, Mike Bassett: England Manager. He returned to ITV1 in 2002, after he won a regular role in the short lived British soap opera Night and Day. He featured in a total of fifty-two episodes.

On May 31, 2004, Walsh's first scenes in Coronation Street, as factory boss Danny Baldwin, were aired. It was originally envisioned that Walsh's character would be called Vic, however, Walsh asked for the character's name to be changed to Danny after his late father. He also commented that "people had previously called me Young Danny, so i thought it would not be so bad when people called me by my character name." In May 2006, Walsh won the award for 'Best Dramatic Performance' in his role as Danny at the British Soap Awards. In December 2006, Walsh was written out of the serial, but he was not killed off, at his own request.

During November and December 2008, Walsh hosted another game show for ITV1, this time in the form of ten-part series Spin Star.[2] During 2008, Walsh also appeared in two episodes of Doctor Who spin-off The Sarah Jane Adventures, in the second story of series two, The Day of the Clown, as a sinister entity that fed off other people's fear. In his role, he played three parts of the same ego - a sinister American sounding clown called Odd Bob, a mysterious European sounding ringmaster called Elijah Spellman, and the infamous Pied Piper of Hamelin. In January 2009, Walsh, along with his son Barney, featured in a special edition of Channel Five factual TV series, Dangerous Adventures for Boys, based on the best-selling book written by Conn and Hal Iggulden, The Dangerous Book for Boys.
