Brian Halligan is an executive and author.[1] He is CEO and co-founder of HubSpot, an Internet marketing company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and is also a Senior Lecturer at MIT. Halligan uses the term inbound marketing to describe the type of marketing he advocates.[2] He has co-authored two books on marketing: Inbound Marketing: Get Found Using Google, Social Media, and Blogs[3] with HubSpot co-founder Dharmesh Shah and Marketing Lessons from the Grateful Dead: What Every Business Can Learn from the Most Iconic Band in History[4] with David Meerman Scott. Halligan was born in Norwood, Massachusetts, and grew up and attended public schools in Westwood, Massachusetts. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Electronic Engineering from the University of Vermont and an MBA from MIT Sloan School of Management in 2005.[5] His career began at Parametric Technology Corporation in several roles leading up to Senior Vice President of the Pacific Rim, which he grew from no revenue to $80 million. However, he found working for a large company to be unsatisfactory, saying, "I tried the big company thing  it sucked."[6][7] He joined Groove Networks as Vice President of Sales, and from 2001 to 2005 he helped to grow the collaboration software company from pre-revenue to $20 million, when it was acquired by Microsoft and rebranded as Microsoft SharePoint Workspace.[8][7] After a period as venture partner at Longworth Ventures[9] he co-founded HubSpot and incorporated it in June 2006. In 2010, Inc. magazine reported that the company has $15.6 million in revenue.[10] As of June 2011, the company has 280 employees.[11] He credits the company's success in part to innovations like the "Alpha, Beta, Version One" policy where employees begin proving their ideas might profit the company "nights and weekends" (the alpha phase) before receiving additional resources (the beta and version one phases).[10] He documents 13 features of the company's "post-modern culture" in an article on Dharmesh Shah's website "OnStartups".[12] These include not tracking vacation time taken by employees, a "Big Hairy" mission to transform the way the world does marketing, and a simple social media policy that consists of the three words "we trust you". Parallel with his role at HubSpot, Halligan serves on the board of directors of House of Possibilities (HOPe; a community service organization that assists children and young adults with developmental disabilities)[13] and Massachusetts Innovation and Technology Exchange (MITX).[14] Halligan's first book, Inbound Marketing, was co-authored with HubSpot co-founder Dharmesh Shah. It is about a method of marketing in which one serves useful information to prospective customers at the moment that they are using a search engine or social media website to fulfill a need. This is in contrast to increasingly ineffective methods of interrupting them with advertisements at random moments. Reviewing the book,[15] Meryl Evans complains that it contains "...elementary stuff..." but admits that it "...does a good job for those who dont have a clue about how to use social media for business...". Reviewing in The Boston Globe, Scott Kirsner relates the book's theme"don't interrupt, get found instead"to The Cluetrain Manifesto and Seth Godin's permission marketing.[16] As of July 2011, the book was in its seventh printing, had sold 40,000 copies, and had been translated into nine languages.[17] The thesis of the book is that people now block interruption marketing (e.g. blocking direct email with spam filters) and that the new way to market products is by creating remarkable content (in the literal sense of "content that will be remarked on, linked to, and upvoted for") such as blog articles and social media that will appear in search engine results pages. The book then goes on to explain how to do this. His second book, Marketing Lessons, was co-authored with David Meerman Scott. It uses the marketing activities of the rock band The Grateful Dead as an example of using inbound marketing methods successfully. Scott Kirsner, reviewing this book in The Boston Globe,[18] mentions that the authors say that they were inspired in part by an article in the Atlantic by Joshua Green.[19] In the book, Halligan notes that he has seen the band and its offshoots over 100 times since first hitchhiking to see them in Saratoga Springs as a high school student. The authors admire the band's many marketing innovations, such as the freemium model, a "taper" section where fans could tape the live show, and early access to tickets via a fan affinity program. Being an advocate of publishing online, Brian is very active in the medium himself, posting on his blog,[20] Facebook,[21] Twitter,[22] and several other sites. Halligan frequently speaks on marketing and business topics, including a keynote speech at the Software & Information Industry Association NetGain meeting,[23] and talks at the 2011 Online Marketing Summit[24] and TEDx.[25] He was Entrepreneur In Residence at MIT[7] and is presently a Senior Lecturer there, teaching 15.S16 "Entrepreneurial Product Development and Marketing" with Elaine Chen.[26] He is also an occasional lecturer at Sloan on the science of selling and marketing.[27] He was named as one of thirteen recipients of the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Of The Year 2011New England Region award.[28]
