Talley Valley Wildlife Sanctuary is a wildlife sanctuary in Arunachal Pradesh, India. Arunachal Pradesh as a whole contains 40% of the floral and faunal species in India. The Ziro valley has a good share of this biodiversity. Thirty kilometres from the town of Ziro is the sanctuary. At the altitude of 2400 metres, Talley is a plateau with dense forest of silver fir trees, pine clad plateau of beautiful grandeur, and a vast wasteland. The area has some of the most important endangered species including the clouded leopard Talle camp is 30 km from Ziro, the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district. The gateway to the sanctuary is the Pange Camp which is 7 km from Manpolyang. In a significant development, the State Wildlife Advisory Board, in its meeting on December 4, 2010, approved the creation of a new Talle Wildlife Sanctuary Division to be headquartered at Manipolyang. Till now, the sanctuary was manned by a Range Officer with few field staff in Pange.
