Raoul Jean Josset (born in 1899, Tours, died in 1957) was a French born American sculptor.[1] During the First World War, he worked as an interpreter for American forces in France. He was a pupil of Antoine Bourdelle between 1920 and 1926. He came to Chicago, Illinois in 1932 with his longtime collaborator Jose Martin to pursue a job with the Northwestern Terra Cotta Company only to find the job closed, but developed plenty of work, first in Illinois, briefly with Cowan Pottery in Lakewood, Ohio, and then principally in Texas.[2]
