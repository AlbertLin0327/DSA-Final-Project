Fuller Rock is a rock awash, one of the principal dangers to ships on the north side of Faure Passage, Marguerite Bay, Antarctica, about 4.2 nautical miles (7.8km) south-southwest of Dismal Island. It was charted by a Royal Navy Hydrographic Survey Unit from RRS John Biscoe in January 1973 and named after Lieutenant Andrew C. Fuller, Royal Navy, who directed the survey.[1][2] This article incorporatespublic domain material from the United States Geological Survey document "Fuller Rock" (content from the Geographic Names Information System).
