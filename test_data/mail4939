The Bluefield Daily Telegraph is seven-day morning daily newspaper based in Bluefield, West Virginia, and also covering surrounding communities in McDowell, Mercer and Monroe counties, West Virginia; and Bland, Buchanan, Giles and Tazewell counties, Virginia (including the Town of Bluefield, Virginia). The weekly Princeton Times, covering Princeton, West Virginia, is also published at the Bluefield Daily Telegraph office. Both newspapers are owned by Community Newspaper Holdings Inc, who acquired them from The Thomson Corporation in 2000.[1] Notable figures in the history of the Bluefield Daily Telegraph include the paper's long-time editor Hugh Ike Shott, who at one point controlled Bluefield's newspaper, both leading radio stations, and only television station. Additionally, Nobel Prize winner John Forbes Nash Jr., a Bluefield native, worked for a time as an inserter, hand inserting sales pieces into the Bluefield Daily Telegraph before going on to a distinguished career in mathematics.
