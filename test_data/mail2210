The Pitt Professorship of American History and Institutions was established on 5 February 1944 from a sum of 44,000 received from the Syndics of the Cambridge University Press in 1943 and augmented by a further 5,000 in 1946. The title of the chair was changed to the Pitt Professorship of American History and Institutions in 1951.[1] The professorship is unusual in that tenure is for a period of one year only.[1]
