Romuald Hazoum (born in Porto Novo, 1962) is an artist from the Republic of Bnin,[1] best known for his work La Bouche du Roi, a reworking of the 1789 image of the slave ship Brookes.[2] La Bouche du Roi was widely exhibited in the United Kingdom as part of the centenary remembrance of the Slave Trade Act 1807 by Parliament. Hazoum is also known for his mask series which he started in the mid-1980s. These masks, made from discarded gasoline canisters, resemble those used in traditional African culture and ceremonies.
