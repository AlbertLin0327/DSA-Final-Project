Launchball is a physics-based Flash game produced by the Science Museum in London, to coincide with the reopening of their hands-on gallery 'Launchpad'. The aim of the game is to get a ball from a starting position to a 'goal' by placing additional blocks onto the grid-based screen. Blocks include springs, slopes, magnets, lights, mirrors and so on. The game has won numerous awards, including at SXSW 2008, where in the Interactive awards in won in the 'Games' category and the 'Best in Show' award.[1] It has also won the Innovative and Overall award at the 2008 Museums and the Web awards,[2] and is nominated for a 2008 Webby Award.[3] On certain Macbooks, Launchball does not seem to work (It gets stuck on the connecting screen), as many other flash applications on Macs don't seem to work either.[citation needed]
