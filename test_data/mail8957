"Skip a Rope' is a 1967 single by Henson Cargill. The single was Cargill's debut release on the country charts and also his most successful single. "Skip a Rope" was Cargill's sole No. 1 on the country charts, spending five weeks at the top and a total of 16 weeks on the chart.[1] The song asked listeners to pay attention to what children would say as they played. It touched on, among other things, verbal spousal abuse, tax evasion and racism, and at the end, laid blame for what the children said directly at the feet of their parents.
