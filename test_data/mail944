The International Sport and Culture Association, ISCA is a non-governmental and not-for-profit international umbrella association of organisations working in the fields of Sport for All, Youth and Culture. ISCA was founded in 1995 with the purpose of providing an alternative image of sport in a world of increasingly performance-based attitude of international sports federations.

ISCA has a vision of sport that is not just about competition and exercise, but also involves learning, having a good time and making friends. Moreover, it is ISCA's philosophy that sport regulates social behaviour and creates a feeling of belongingwhich in turn leads to a more inclusive society.

ISCA targets youth, sports, and culture associations from all over the world, primarily non-governmental organisations generally speaking, voluntary sport organisations which have a value-based service to their members. The practical reality is to encourage all organisations to assist the members and regions/clubs in fulfilling their aims in providing services and instruments to achieve this. The international interest of the sports organisations members today demands that international opportunities are provided indeed, organisations have an interest in developing. Organisational development and inspiration are the basis for fulfilling the goals of the organisation in the long run. To fulfil the above, ISCA concentrates on three key areas: activities, education, and policy-making. ISCA not only offers and promotes events and educational programmes but additionally takes a full role in the public debate on sport and culture and strives to influence policies in these areas. Overall, ISCA hopes to improve the general health and well being of individuals in creating a united society. Supporting cross-border understanding through sport and culture.
