Whip Rush ( ) (or Whip Rush: Mystery of the planet Voltegas, Whip Rush 2222AD: The Invasion of the Voltegians) is a side-scrolling space shooter released in 1990 for the Sega Mega Drive System and subsequently for its American counterpart, the Sega Genesis. It came onto the video game scene at a time when this genre was immensely popular. In the year 2222 AD, three exploratory spaceships left the overpopulated Earth on mission to find similar planets to colonize. After five years, the pilots reported finding a similar planet they learned was called Voltegeus, but upon approach their transmission was lost and the ships never re-established contact. Less than a week after the discovery, a massive alien vessel materialized in the vicinity of Mars and started attacking the Earth. Thankfully, Earth's smallest, but most powerful spaceship, the Whip Rush, is ready to attack. It is now up to the Whip Rush to stop the invasion of the Voltegians and discover what truly happened to the missing colony ships. Whip Rush's gameplay style was very similar to R-Type: The title ship flew through 7 dangerous stages and was forced to fight large bosses using timed attacks. The ship's Options were similar to the ones in Curse or Psychosis: The ship could be equipped with two Options at a time and the player could rotate them around the ship changing their directional fire at the same time. The player had a total of three weapons to choose from and could change the ship's speed through eight different speed levels. Extends were awarded and there were no checkpoints, but if a player lost all their lives and continued, they would have to restart the level over again. Despite having different covers when sold in the US and Japan, the game was identical. In both regions, PAL and NTSC the hardware would both display English. Whip Rush at MobyGames
