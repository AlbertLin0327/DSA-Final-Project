Rajiv Goel was a midlevel executive at Intel. He was a managing director in Intel's treasury department and a director of strategic investments at Intel Capital. In 2009 he was arrested for insider trading with friend and hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam in a sprawling U.S. federal investigation centered around the Galleon Group. He pleaded guilty to securities fraud and conspiracy in February 2010.[1] Goel met Rajaratnam while they were both students at Wharton business school. He testified in the high-profile case U.S. v Rajaratnam against the hedge fund billionaire. According to The New York Times, "the bulk of Mr. Goels testimony was about how Mr. Rajaratnam, a hedge fund billionaire, provided financial support to him....Despite his consistent employment, Mr. Goel looked to Mr. Rajaratnam for financial support." This established the requisite quid pro quo for an insider trading conviction.[2] Intel had little knowledge of Goel's activities, with CEO Paul Otellini saying, "My first thought was, 'Who's Rajiv Goel' -- I'd never heard of this guy," according to a Fox transcript. "He's a fairly low-level guy."[3]
