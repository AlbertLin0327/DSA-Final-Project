Faggot, often shortened to fag, is a pejorative term and common slur used chiefly in North America against homosexual males.[3] Its pejorative use, broadly meaning a "repellent male", has spread from the United States to varying extents elsewhere in the English-speaking world through mass culture, including movies, music, and the Internet.[4] The word meaning "bundle of sticks" is ultimately derived, via Old French, Italian and Vulgar Latin, from Latin fascis (also the origin of the word fascism).[5] The origins of the word as an offensive epithet for homosexuals are rather obscure, although the word has been used in English since the late 16th century as an abusive term for women, particularly old women,[6] and reference to homosexuality may derive from this,[5][7] as female terms are often used with reference to homosexual or effeminate men (cf. nancy, sissy, queen). The application of the term to old women is possibly a shortening of the term "faggot-gatherer", applied in the 19th century to people, especially older widows, who made a meagre living by gathering and selling firewood.[7] It may also derive from the sense of "something awkward to be carried" (compare the use of the word "baggage" as a pejorative term for old people in general).[5] Use of the word as a general insult, not necessarily implying homosexuality, is either a continuation or extension of this older usage[6] or of the homosexual usage. It is sometimes claimed that the modern slang meaning developed from the standard meaning of "faggot" as "bundle of sticks for burning," presumably with reference to burning at the stake.[5] It is true that supposed witches and heretics were burnt to death in some parts of Europe, and were often accused of deviant sexual behaviour.[8] However, any association of faggots with executions had long become a historical curiosity by the time the slang sense of the word arose in twentieth-century America.[5] Moreover, burning was never prescribed as a punishment for homosexuality in either Britain or America.[7][5] This explanation is therefore considered to be an urban legend.[5] An alternative possibility is that the word is connected with the practice of fagging in British private schools, in which younger boys performed (potentially sexual) duties for older boys,[5] although the word faggot was never used in this context, only fag. There is a reference to the word faggot being used in 17th century Britain to refer to a "man hired into military service simply to fill out the ranks at muster", but there is no known connection with the word's modern pejorative usage.[5] The Yiddish word faygele, lit. "little bird", has been claimed by some to be related to the American usage. The similarity between the two words makes it possible that it might at least have had a reinforcing effect.[7][5] Originally confined to the United States,[5] the use of the words "fag" and "faggot" as epithets for gay men has spread elsewhere in the English-speaking world, but the extent to which they are used in this sense has varied outside the context of imported US popular culture. The words "queer", "homo", and "poof" are all still in common use in the UK, and some other countries, as pejorative terms for gay men. The words "fag" and "faggot", moreover, still have other meanings in the British Isles and other Commonwealth societies. In particular, "faggot" is still used to refer to a kind of meatball, and "fag" is common as a slang word for "cigarette". Use of fag and faggot as the term for an effeminate man has become understood as an Americanism in British English, primarily due to entertainment media use in films and television series imported from the United States. When Labour MP Bob Marshall-Andrews was overheard supposedly using the word in a bad-tempered informal exchange with a straight colleague in the House of Commons lobby in November 2005, it was considered to be homophobic abuse.[9][10] The word with reference to homosexuality was used as early as in the 1914 Jackson and Hellyer A Vocabulary of Criminal Slang, with Some Examples of Common Usages which listed the following example under the word, drag:[11] The word was also used by a character in Claude McKays 1928 novel Home to Harlem, indicating that it was used during the Harlem Renaissance. Specifically, one character says that he cannot understand: Through ethnographic research in a high school setting, CJ Pascoe examines how high school boys use the term 'fag.' Pascoe's work shows that boys in high school use the fag epithet as a way to assert their own masculinity by claiming that another boy is less masculine, making him a fag. The way the word fag is used in this context shows that it is less about sexual orientation and more about gender. In fact, one-third of the boys in Pascoe's study claimed that they would not call a homosexual peer a fag. Fag is used in this setting as a form of gender policing, in which boys point out and ridicule others who fail at masculinity, heterosexual prowess, or strength. Because boys do not want to be labeled a fag, they hurl the insult at another person to deflect their temporary position as the fag. The fag identity does not constitute a static identity attached to the boy receiving the insult. Rather, fag is a fluid identity that boys strive to avoid, often by naming another as the fag. As Pascoe asserts, "[the fag identity] is fluid enough that boys police their behaviors out of fear of having the fag identity permanently adhere and definitive enough so that boys recognize a fag behavior and strive to avoid it." Gender policing is most common among white boys, while black boys are more concerned with "acting" appropriately black. The black youth in Pascoe's study often ridiculed one another for "acting white," and did not express homophobia to the same degree as white boys. [12] There is a long history of using both fag and faggot in popular culture, usually to denigrate lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman's 1995 documentary The Celluloid Closet, based on Vito Russo's book of the same name notes the use of fag and faggot throughout Hollywood film history.[14] The Think Before You Speak (campaign) has sought to stop fag and gay being used as generic insults.[15] In 1973 a broadway musical called "The Faggot" was praised by critics but condemned by gay liberation proponents.[16] Larry Kramer's 1978 novel, Faggots, discusses the gay community including the use of the word within and towards the community.[17] In its November 2002 issue, the New Oxford Review, a Catholic magazine, caused controversy by its use and defense of the word in an editorial. During the correspondence between the editors and a gay reader, the editors clarified that they would only use the word to describe a "practicing homosexual". They defended the use of the word, saying that it was important to preserve the social stigma of gays and lesbians.[18] The Dire Straits 1985 song "Money for Nothing" makes notable use of the epithet "faggot",[19] although the lines containing it are often excised for radio play, and in live performances by singer/songwriter Mark Knopfler. In 1989, Sebastian Bach, lead singer of the band Skid Row, created a controversy when he wore a t-shirt with the parody slogan "Aids: Kills Fags Dead".[20] The 2001 song "American Triangle" by Elton John and Bernie Taupin uses the phrase God hates fags where we come from.. The song is about Matthew Shephard, a Wyoming man who was killed because he was gay.[21] The 2007 song The Bible Says, which includes the line "God Hates Fags" (sometimes used as an alternate title) caused considerable controversy when it was published on various websites. Apparently an anti-gay song written and performed by an ex-gay pastor "Donnie Davies", it was accompanied by the realistic Love God's Way website about his "ministry". Debate ensued about whether Donnie Davies and the outrageous song, which included a few double-entendres, were for real, and whether the lyrics could ever be considered acceptable even in satire. Donnie Davies was revealed in 2007 to be a character played by actor and entertainer. Some gay rights advocates acknowledge that as a spoof it is humorous, but claim the message behind it is still as malicious as someone who seriously possessed the opinion.[22][23][24] In December 2007, BBC Radio 1 caused controversy by editing the word "faggot" from their broadcasts of the Kirsty MacColl & The Pogues song "Fairytale of New York," deeming it potentially homophobic; however, the edit did not extend to other BBC stations, such as BBC Radio 2. Following widespread criticism and pressure from listeners, the decision was reversed and the original unedited version of the song was reinstated, with clarification from Andy Parfitt, the station controller, that in the context of the song the lyrics had no "negative intent."[25][26] Patty Griffin uses the word 'faggot' in her song Tony. The song is about a classmate of hers from high school who committed suicide.[27] In 1995, former House Majority Leader Dick Armey referred to openly gay congressman Barney Frank as "Barney Fag" in a press interview.[28] Armey apologized and said it was "a slip of the tongue". Frank did not accept Armey's explanation, saying "I turned to my own expert, my mother, who reports that in 59 years of marriage, no one ever introduced her as Elsie Fag."[29] In July 2006 conservative pundit Ann Coulter, while being interviewed by MSNBC's Chris Matthews, said that the former U.S. Vice President Al Gore was a "total fag", and suggested that former U.S. President Bill Clinton may be a "latent homosexual".[30] Coulter caused a major controversy in the LGBT community; GLAAD and other gay rights organizations demanded to know the reason why such an offensive usage of the word was permitted by the network. In October 2006, Grey's Anatomy star Isaiah Washington called his co-star T.R. Knight a "faggot" on the set during an argument with Patrick Dempsey. According to Knight, the incident led to him publicly coming out of the closet.[31] Washington made another outburst using the epithet, this time backstage at the Golden Globe Awards. In January 2007, Washington issued a public apology for using the word "faggot" and went into rehab to help him with what the show's creator Shonda Rimes referred to as "his behavioral issues."[32] In March 2007 Coulter again created controversy when she made an off-color joke: "I was going to have a few comments on the other Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards, but it turns out you have to go into rehab if you use the word "faggot," so I'm kind of at an impasse, can't really talk about Edwards ..."[33][34] Her comments triggered a campaign by a gay rights group and media watchdog to persuade mainstream media outlets to ban her shows and appearances. In November 2009, the South Park episode "The F Word" aired. It deals with the overuse of the word fag, along with its history and how it evolved from a 16th century slang meaning "old or unpleasant woman" to a homophobic slur into a general insult commonly used amongst American youth.[35] The four lead characters, Eric Cartman, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski and Kenny McCormick, assert that the meaning remains an insult but refers to Harley motorcyclists. The boys convince the town to officially change the meaning, which is kept despite criticism from the rest of the nation. However, the town then invites Emmanuel Lewis, who is in charge of the dictionary and the meaning of the word fag is officially changed to reference to Harley riders who's inconsiderately loud motorcycles ruin everyone else's nice time.[36][37][38]
