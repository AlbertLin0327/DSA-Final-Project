The left seat in the cockpit of an aircraft is the seat normally used by the captain or pilot in command.[1] The co-pilot then sits in the right seat. This is not a formal rule or law, however, only a tradition. In helicopters, the pilot in command often occupies the starboard seat. In some early aircraft, left turns were easier than right turns best of the direction of spin of the engine and propeller.[1][2] Hence it was advantageous to sit on the left hand side. The tradition has been maintained to this day, and aligns with some formal rules, such as a standard circuit being flown with left-hand turns.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
