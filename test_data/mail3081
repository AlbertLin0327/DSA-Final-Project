Johan Agrell (1 February 1701  19 January 1765) was a late German/Swedish baroque composer. He was born in Lth, stergtland, a province in Sweden, and studied in Uppsala. By 1734 he was a violinist at the Kassel court, travelling in England, France, Italy, and elsewhere. From 1746 onward, he was Kapellmeister in Nuremberg. He wrote occasional vocal works and numerous symphonies, harpsichord concertos and sonatas, many of which were published. He was a fluent composer in the north German galant style of the time, and is also an appreciated musician and conductor. In a book by Per Lindfors, it is said that Agrell composed a total of at least 22 symphonies. He died at Nuremberg.
