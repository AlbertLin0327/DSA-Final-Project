Freshfel Europe, the European Fresh Produce Association, is the forum for the fresh fruit and vegetables supply chain in Europe and beyond and a non-profit association.[1] Its members and associated members are associations and companies that have an interest in the European fresh fruit and vegetable sector, including production, trade, logistics and retailing. The association was created in 2001 on the roots of 40 years of experience of EUCOFEL (European Fruit and Vegetable Trade Association) and CIMO (Confederation of Importers of Overseas Fruits and Vegetables). The association is based in Brussels with registered Article of Association with the Belgian Ministry of Justice.[2] Besides its representation-/lobby-activities, summed up in an annual report,[3] Freshfel publishes once a year the Consumption Monitor and is the co-organiser of the fresh produce business conference Fresh,[4] a joint conference of Freshfel and the Eurofruit Magazine.[5] Freshfel is a member-driven association, undertaking multiple representation and the coordination of tasks for the overall benefit of the fresh produce sector. Freshfel defends the interests of the sector on the European and international scene, and updates members on recent legislative and supply chain developments. Freshfel provides a networking platform for its members and facilitates contacts among representatives of the sector. Freshfels mission aims to:  improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the sector  facilitate international fresh produce trade  assist members to comply with the highest safety rules  securing a favourable environment to promote the benefits of fresh produce  positioning the sector in the new research and innovation policy  stimulating the consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables [3] The Annual General Meeting (AGM) of Freshfel in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, was on 25 May 2011 and set the priorities for the upcoming months. Freshfel Europe incorporates over 200 companies and national associations of producers, importers, shippers and exporters, distributors, wholesalers, retailers and their service providers such as logistics and reefer transportation, as well as seed companies and crop protection companies. Members and associated members are both from within the EU and in countries with an interest in the European fruit and vegetables market. Freshfel Europe is structured around a Board and four Divisions. Freshfels work is also further developed through a series of committees with dedicated missions. The Board consists of the Associations President, Vice-President and the Treasurer, as well as the Chairmen and the two Vice-Chairmen of each of the four Divisions (Import; Export; Wholesale, Distribution and Foodservices, and Supply Chain). The Board also includes the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Promotion, Communication and Image Committee, the Committee on Food Quality and Sustainability as well as the Citrus Committee and the Banana Committee. All Board members are elected for a mandate period of two years. The Board was renewed by the 2010 AGM which took place in Brussels (Belgium) on 3 June 2010 for the 2010/2012 term of activities. Besides the Board assignments which are ad personam, Freshfel operates in an open manner, inviting all its members and associated members to attend the regular meetings organised by the Association on topical and emerging issues.[3] The Consumption Monitor was developed by the Freshfel Working Group on Promotion, Communication and Image and analyses each year the trends in the production, trade and supply of fresh fruits and vegetables across the EU-27, as well as consumption information in Norway, Switzerland and the USA.[6] The study is part of the actions undertaken by Freshfel in the framework of the EU Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health. In the course of its media campaign to highlight the value of fresh produce in the first half of 2011 Freshfel has launched in February the so called Enjoy Fresh website.[7] It is the first pan-European website to highlight the positive features of fresh produce and tries to raise the awareness about the values and benefits fresh produce provides to consumers. The website provides information on the production and sustainability aspects of fruit and vegetables, on what is being done to ensure a 'quality' product, information on the nutrition and health benefits, statistical facts, and also tips on how to prepare / consume fresh produce.[8]
