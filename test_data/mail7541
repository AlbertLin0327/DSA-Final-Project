Grover's Mill is an unincorporated area within West Windsor Township, New Jersey made famous in Orson Welles' 1938 radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds, where it was depicted as ground zero for a Martian invasion, on October 30th of that year. There have been numerous references in fiction, including The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, the Wild Cards book series, and a town called Miller's Grove in The X-Files episode "War of the Coprophages". In issue 11 of DC Comics' The Shadow Strikes (1989), The Shadow teams up with a radio announcer named Grover Mills, a character based on the young Orson Welles, who has been impersonating The Shadow on the radio. Welles played the Shadow on radio prior to the War of the Worlds broadcast. An episode of the War of the Worlds TV series takes place in Grover's Mill on the 50th anniversary of the Welles radio drama, and expands on the town's ties to the infamous broadcast. An episode of the show Ben 10: Alien Force also takes place in a farm called Grover's Mill. Grover's Mill is also a 2006 film shot in Vancouver, BC.
