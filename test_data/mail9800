Hermit kingdom is a pejorative term applied to any country or society which willfully walls itself off (metaphorically or physically) from the rest of the world. The Joseon Dynasty of Korea was frequently described as a hermit kingdom during the latter part of the dynasty. The term is still commonplace throughout Korea and is often used by Koreans themselves to describe pre-modern Korea. Today, the term is often applied to North Korea in news media, and in 2009 was used by United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.[1] Other countries like Bhutan and the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen have also been described as hermit kingdoms due to their government's reluctance to engage in dialogue with the outside world. The early African civilization of Axum, modernly known as Ethiopia, was identified by the Europeans as the "hermit kingdom". The first documented use of "hermit" to refer to Korea is in the title of William Elliot Griffis' 1882 book, Corea: The Hermit Nation. The writer of the book had never visited Korea, did not speak the language, and had no first-hand experience with the country. He supported the invasion and occupation of Korea by Japan, and in his works often attempted to prove the superiority of Japan. The publication of The Hermit Kingdom, and its circulation, particularly in North America, led to tacit approval of Japan's incursions into Korea. It was used to justify Japanese actions by showing the Korean people as primitive, uncultured, unable to function internationally, and needing Japanese direction. The expression quickly gained currency in Western discussions of Korea. As early as Carpenter's Geographical Reader of Asia (NY, American Book Company, 1897) reference is made to "the hermit nation" which is "largely controlled by Japan". Comments are also made that "Koreans until lately have driven travelers away from their shores" and that "the United States...opened Korea to the rest of the world". [2][3][4]
