Franz Maria Doppelbauer (1845-1908) was the bishop of Linz from 1889 to 1908. He was a patron and promoter of Catholic interests in Austria. He gave encouragement to Catholic associations and the Catholic press, establishing personally a newspaper. He founded at Urfahr a seminary for boys, the Petrinum, as atraining-ground for the future clergy. The completion of the cathedral (consecrated May, 1905) was also due to his energetic efforts.
