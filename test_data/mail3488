Cindy Bear is a cartoon character created by Hanna-Barbera. Cindy Bear (voiced by Julie Bennett) is the girlfriend of Yogi Bear. She speaks with a pronounced Southern accent, and carries a parasol. Cindy Bear originally appeared in the shorts Acobatty Bear, A Wooin' Bruin and the three-parter Yogi's Birthday Party where her fur was blue, but it was later changed to match that of Yogi's and Boo Boo's in Hey There, It's Yogi Bear! in 1964. She also wore a hat in the original 1961 cartoons and on a few of her later appearances as well. Cindy has appeared in some episodes of Yogi's Gang in 1973, as a member of the Yogi Yahooeys in the Laff-A-Lympics, in the holiday telefilm Yogi's First Christmas in 1980, in the Yogi's Treasure Hunt episode "To Be Bee or Not to Be Bee," in the telefilm Yogi and the Invasion of the Space Bears, as a regular in The New Yogi Bear Show, and as a teenager in Yo Yogi! (in which she was voiced by Kath Soucie). Her more recent cameo was in a MetLife commercial in 2012.
