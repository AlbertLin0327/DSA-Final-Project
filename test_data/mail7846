In mathematics, the (linear) Peetre theorem, named after Jaak Peetre, is a result of functional analysis that gives a characterisation of differential operators in terms of their effect on generalized function spaces, and without mentioning differentiation in explicit terms. The Peetre theorem is an example of a finite order theorem in which a function or a functor, defined in a very general way, can in fact be shown to be a polynomial because of some extraneous condition or symmetry imposed upon it. This article treats two forms of the Peetre theorem. The first is the original version which, although quite useful in its own right, is actually too general for most applications. Let M be a smooth manifold and let E and F be two vector bundles on M. Let be the spaces of smooth sections of E and F. An operator is a morphism of sheaves which is linear on sections such that the support of D is non-increasing: supp Ds  supp s for every smooth section s of E. The original Peetre theorem asserts that, for every point p in M, there is a neighborhood U of p and an integer k (depending on U) such that D is a differential operator of order k over U. This means that D factors through a linear mapping iD from the k-jet of sections of E into the space of smooth sections of F: where is the k-jet operator and is a linear mapping of vector bundles. The proof relies on choosing a smooth metric on M, and in E and F. At this point, it relies primarily on two lemmas: We begin with the proof of Lemma 1. We now prove Lemma 2. Let M be a compact smooth manifold (possibly with boundary), and E and F be finite dimensional vector bundles on M. Let be the collection of smooth sections of E. An operator is a smooth function (of Frchet manifolds) which is linear on the fibres and respects the base point on M: The Peetre theorem asserts that for each operator D, there exists an integer k such that D is a differential operator of order k. Specifically, is a mapping from the jets of sections of E to the bundle F. See also intrinsic differential operators.
