Royal Clipper is a steel-hulled five masted fully rigged tall ship used as a cruise ship. She was designed by Zygmunt Chore, and built using an existing steel hull that was modified by the Gdask Shipyard, and the Merwede shipyard completed the ship's interior in July 2000. The renovations included frescography murals by Rainer Maria Latzke completing the ships' Mediterranean interior.[1] Her design was based on Preussen, a famous German five-mast Flying P-Liner windjammer built in 1902. Star Clippers claims that she is the largest "true sailing ship" built since Preussen. She is listed in the Guinness World Records book as the largest square-rigged ship in service, with 5202 square metres of sail. Her sails can be handled with a crew as small as twenty using powered controls.[2] Royal Clipper cruises the Mediterranean during the summer. During the winter she offers Caribbean trips through the southern parts of the Lesser Antilles area. Because of her size, she can visit smaller ports that larger cruise ships can't reach. Transatlantic crossings are available between seasons.[3] Royal Clipper silhouetted against the sunset Lobby of Royal Clipper with murals from Rainer Maria Latzke Royal Clipper (painting by Rainer Maria Latzke) Royal Clipper Bow of Royal Clipper Bell of Royal Clipper Sails of Royal Clipper Helm of Royal Clipper Royal Clipper anchored near the port of Split, Croatia, on July the 3rd 2011.
