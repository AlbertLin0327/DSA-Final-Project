Si Samrong (Thai: ) is a district (Amphoe) in the central part of Sukhothai Province in northern Thailand. Neighboring districts are (from the south clockwise) Mueang Sukhothai, Ban Dan Lan Hoi, Thung Saliam and Sawankhalok of Sukhothai Province and Phrom Phiram of Phitsanulok Province. The important water resource is the Yom River. The district was renamed from Khlong Tan to Si Samrong in 1939.[1] The district is subdivided into 13 subdistricts (tambon), which are further subdivided into 137 villages (muban). The township (thesaban tambon) Si Samrong covers the whole tambon Wang Luek and parts of the tambon Khlong Tan and Sam Ruean. There are further 12 Tambon administrative organizations (TAO).
