William N. Rhodes was an American airforce Technical Sergeant in World War II. On March 31, 1945, TSgt. William N. Rhodes' aircraft was engaged in a mission to take out a primary target (oil refinery) at Ziet, Germany. During that engagement his B-17 aircraft was hit by enemy fire. The number three engine oil supply line was cut by flak, and the landing gear was hit and jammed. Flak also damaged an engine housing causing that prop to be shut down and feathered. The Aircraft was able to maintain an altitude of 17,500 feet and began its journey back to England when two jet propelled German fighters attacked. These two German aircraft were sighted and immediately reported to the pilot by TSgt. Rhodes. The B-17 was hit during the German fighter attack inflicting extensive damage to the aircraft's number three fuel tank, causing it to explode and tossed the right wing violently. Following this hit the aircraft went into a tight downward spin, within just a few thousand feet the tail section of the aircraft blew off causing the aircraft to level off slightly and continue falling in a shallow spin. This presented the opportunity for the Navigator, Turret Gunner, Co-Pilot and TSgt. Rhodes to bail out. TSgt. Rhodes and three other crew members landed near Biberach, Germany. Of the nine original crew members on the B-17, only four survived the aerial encounter. Upon landing, TSgt. Rhodes and the other survivors were captured by German troops waiting on the ground, searched and taken to a Luftwaffe camp where they were processed as Prisoners of war.
