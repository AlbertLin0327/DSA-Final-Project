The Mars Polar Lander, also referred to as the Mars Surveyor '98 Lander, was a 290-kilogram robotic spacecraft lander, launched by NASA on January 3, 1999, to study the soil and climate of Planum Australe, a region near the south pole on Mars, as part of the Mars Surveyor '98 mission. However, on December 3, 1999, after the descent phase was expected to be complete, the lander failed to reestablish communication with Earth. It was determined the most likely cause of the mishap was an improperly ceased engine firing prior to the lander touching the surface, causing the lander to impact at a high velocity. As part of the intended goals of the Mars Surveyor '98 mission, a lander was sought as a way to gather climate data from the ground in conjunction with an orbiter. It was suspected that a large quantity of frozen water may exist under a thin layer of dust at the south pole. If that were true, then why does it differ from the Martian north pole, a region suspected to contain much less frozen water. In planning Mars Polar Lander, the potential water content in the Martian south pole was the strongest determining factor for choosing a landing location.[1] The primary objectives of the mission included:[2] Mars Polar Lander carried two, small, identical impactor probes known as Deep Space 2 A and B. The probes were intended to impact the surface with a high velocity at approximately 73S 210W / 73S 210W / -73; -210 (Deep Space 2), to penetrate the Martian soil and study the subsurface composition up to a meter in depth. However, after entering the Martian atmosphere, attempts to contact the probes failed.[1] The spacecraft measured 3.6 meters wide and 1.06 meters tall with the legs and solar arrays fully deployed. The base was primarily constructed with an aluminum honeycomb deck, composite graphite epoxy sheets forming the edge, and three aluminum legs. During landing, the legs were to deploy from stowed position with compression springs and absorb the force of the landing with crushable, aluminum honeycomb inserts in each leg. On the deck of the lander, a small thermal, Faraday cage enclosure housed the computer, power distribution electronics and batteries, telecommunication electronics, and the Capillary Pump Loop Heat Pipe (LHP) components which maintained operable temperature. Each these components included redundant units in the event that one may fail.[1][3][4] Mounted to the bottom of the lander, the camera was intended to capture thirty images as the spacecraft descended to the surface. The images acquired would be used to provide geographic and geologic context to the landing area.[5] Using a pair of charge coupled devices (CCD), the stereo panoramic camera was mounted to a one-meter tall mast and would aid in the Thermal Evolved Gas Analyzer and determining areas of interest for the Robotic Arm. In addition, the camera would be used to estimate the column density of atmospheric dust, the optical depth of aerosols, and slant column abundances of water vapor using narrow-band imaging of the Sun.[6] The laser sounding instrument was intended to detect and characterize aerosols in the atmosphere up to three kilometers above the lander. The instrument operated in two modes: active mode using an included laser diode and acoustic mode using the Sun as the light source for the sensor. Located on the front of the lander, the Robotic Arm is a meter-long aluminum tube with an elbow joint and an articulated scoop attached to the end. The scoop was intended to be used to dig into the soil in direct vicinity of the lander. The soil could then be analyzed in the scoop with the Robotic Arm Camera or transferred into the Thermal Evolved Gas Analyzer.[6] Located on the Robotic Arm, the charge coupled camera includes 2 red, 2 green, and 4 blue lamps to illuminate soil samples for analysis.[6] Several instruments related to sensing and recording weather patterns, were included in the package. Wind, temperature, pressure and humidity sensors were located on the Robotic Arm and two deployable masts: a 1.2-meter 'main' mast, located on top of the lander and a 0.9-meter secondary 'submast' that would deploy downward to acquire measurements close to the ground.[6] "Wind speed and direction is measured by a nine-element hot wire array wind sensor mounted on the main mast and a two-element wind sensor mounted on the submast. Three fast thermocouple assembly temperature sensors are mounted at different heights on the main mast. Two temperature sensors are also located on the submast and one on the elbow joint of the robotic arm. A soil temperature probe on a 15 cm fiberglass tube is mounted on the back of the robotic arm scoop and can be pushed into the ground by the arm. A barocap atmospheric pressure sensor is located inside the Payload Electronics Box. A tunable diode 2.656 and 2.729 micrometer laser is mounted on the main mast to measure the abundance of atmospheric water and carbon dioxide and to measure the isotopic ratios carbon-13/carbon-12 and oxygen-18/oxygen-16 in atmospheric carbon dioxide, and deuterium/hydrogen and oxygen-18/oxygen-16 in atmospheric water."[6] The instrument was intended to measure abundances of water, water ice, adsorbed carbon dioxide, oxygen, and volatile-bearing minerals in surface and subsurface soil samples collected and transferred by the Robotic Arm. To do this, materials placed onto a grate inside one of the eight ovens, would be heated and vaporized at 1000 C. The Evolved Gas Analyzer would then record measurements using a spectrometer and an electrochemical cell. For calibration, an empty oven would also be heated during this process for differential scanning calorimetry. The difference in the energy required to heat each oven would then indicate concentrations of water ice and other minerals containing water or carbon dioxide.[6] The microphone was intended to be the first instrument to record sounds on another planet. Primarily composed of a microphone generally used with hearing aids, the instrument was expected to record sounds of blowing dust, electrical discharges and the sounds of the operating spacecraft in either 2.6-second or 10.6-second, 12-bit samples.[8] The microphone used speech recognition from technology Sensory, Inc.[9] Mars Polar Lander was launched on January 3, 1999, at 20:21:10 UTC by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration from Space Launch Complex 17B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, aboard a Delta II 7425 launch vehicle. The complete burn sequence lasted for 47.7 minutes after a Thiokol Star 48B solid-fuel third stage booster placed the spacecraft into an 11 month, Mars transfer trajectory at a final velocity of 6.884 kilometers per second with respect to Mars. During cruise, the spacecraft was stowed inside an aeroshell capsule and was powered and communicated with Earth with the a segment known as the cruise stage.[1][2][3] On December 3, 1999, Mars Polar Lander encountered Mars while mission operators began preparing for landing operations. At 14:39:00 UTC, the cruise stage was jettisoned, beginning a planned communication dropout until the spacecraft had touched down on the surface. Six minutes prior to atmospheric entry, a programmed 80-second thruster firing turned the spacecraft to the proper entry orientation, with the heat shield oriented to absorb the intense, 1650 C heat that would be generated as the descent capsule passed through the atmosphere. Traveling at 6.9 kilometers per second, the entry capsule entered the Martian atmosphere at 20:10:00 UTC and was expected to land in the vicinity of 76S 195W / 76S 195W / -76; -195 (Mars Polar Lander) in a region known as Planum Australe. Communication was expected to be reestablished with the spacecraft at 20:39:00 UTC after having landed. However, no communication attempt was successful with the spacecraft.[1][2][3] The Phoenix lander has subsequently completed most of the objectives of Mars Polar Lander, carrying several of the same or derivative instruments. Phoenix landed successfully on May 25, 2008. Traveling at approximately 6.9 kilometers/second and 125 kilometers above the surface, the spacecraft entered the atmosphere and was initially decelerated by using a 2.4 meter ablation heat shield, located on the bottom of the entry body, to aerobrake through 116 kilometers of the atmosphere. Three minutes after entry, the spacecraft had slowed to 496 meters per second signaling an 8.4-meter, polyester parachute to deploy from a mortar followed immediately by heat shield separation and MARDI being powered on, while 8.8 kilometers above the surface. The parachute further slowed the speed of the spacecraft to 85 meters per second when the ground radar began tracking surface features to detect the best possible landing location. When the spacecraft had slowed to 80 meters per second, one minute after parachute deployment, the lander separated from the backshell and began a powered descent while 1.3 kilometers aloft. The powered descent was expected to have lasted approximately one minute, bringing the spacecraft 12 meters above the surface. The engines were then shut off and the spacecraft would expectedly fall to the surface and land at 20:15:00 UTC near 76S 195W in Planum Australe.[1][2][3][4] Lander operations were to begin five minutes after touchdown, first unfolding the stowed solar arrays followed by orienting the medium-gain, Direct-To-Earth antenna to allow for the first communication with the Deep Space Network. At 20:39:00 UTC, a 45-minute transmission was to be broadcast to Earth, transmitting the expected thirty landing images acquired by MARDI and signaling a successful landing. The lander would then power down for six hours to allow the batteries to charge. On the following days, the spacecraft instruments would be checked by operators and science experiments were to begin on December 7 and last for at least the following 90 Martian Sols, with the possibility of an extended mission.[1][2][3][4]  On December 3, 1999, at 14:39:00 UTC, the last telemetry from Mars Polar Lander was sent, just prior to cruise stage separation and the subsequent atmospheric entry. No further signals were received from the spacecraft. Attempts were made by Mars Global Surveyor, to photograph the area the lander was believed to be. An object was visible and believed to possibly be the lander; however, subsequent imaging performed by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter resulted in the identified object to be incorrect. Mars Polar Lander remains lost.[10][11] The cause of the communication loss is not known. However, the Failure Review Board concluded that the most likely cause of the mishap was a software error that incorrectly identified vibrations, caused by the deployment of the stowed legs, as surface touchdown.[12] The resulting action by the spacecraft was the shutdown of the descent engines, while still likely 40 meters above the surface. Although it was known that leg deployment could create the false indication, the software's design instructions did not account for that eventuality.[13] In addition to the premature shutdown of the descent engines, the Failure Review Board also assessed other potential modes of failure.[14] Lacking substantial evidence for the mode of failure, the following possibilies could not be excluded: The failure of the Mars Polar Lander took place two and a half months after the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter. Inadequate funding and poor management have been cited as underlying causes of the failures.[15] According to Thomas Young, chairman of the Mars Program Independent Assessment Team, the program "was under funded by at least 30%."[16] "A magnetic sensor is provided in each of the three landing legs to sense touchdown when the lander contacts the surface, initiating the shutdown of the descent engines. Data from MPL engineering development unit deployment tests, MPL flight unit deployment tests, and Mars 2001 deployment tests showed that a spurious touchdown indication occurs in the Hall Effect touchdown sensor during landing leg deployment (while the lander is connected to the parachute). The softwarelogic accepts this transient signal as a valid touchdown event if it persists for two consecutive readings of the sensor. The tests showed that most of the transient signals at leg deployment are indeed long enough to be accepted as valid events, therefore, it is almost a certainty that at least one of the three would have generated a spurious touchdown indication that the software accepted as valid. The softwareintended to ignore touchdown indications prior to the enabling of the touchdown sensing logicwas not properly implemented, and the spurious touchdown indication was retained. The touchdown sensing logic is enabled at 40 meters altitude, and the software would have issued a descent engine thrust termination at this time in response to a (spurious) touchdown indication. At 40 meters altitude, the lander has a velocity of approximately 13 meters per second, which, in the absence of thrust, is accelerated by Mars gravity to a surface impact velocity of approximately 22 meters per second (the nominal touchdown velocity is 2.4 meters per second). At this impact velocity, the lander could not have survived."
