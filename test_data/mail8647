A money belt is a belt with a pouch attached to the front which is worn under a shirt to protect valuables from thieves and/or pickpockets. Money belts are often worn by tourists as a precaution against theft. Items typically placed in a money belt would include passport, travel tickets, driver's license, credit cards, cash, and jewelry.
