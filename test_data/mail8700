Vicia hassei is a species of vetch known by the common name Hasse's vetch. It is native to the west coast of North America from Oregon through California to Baja California, where it occurs in many types of coastal and inland habitat. It is an annual herb. The leaves are made up of a few pairs of leaflets up to 2.5 centimeters long often with flat, notched, or toothed tips. The inflorescence is usually a solitary flower or a pair of flowers with white or lavender corollas just under a centimeter long. The fruit is a legume pod 2 or 3 centimeters in length and a few millimeters wide which contains the seeds.
