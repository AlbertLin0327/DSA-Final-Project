TrueConf is a Russian company that designs and produces video conferencing solutions. Headquartered in Moscow, Russia, the company has offices in Ukraine, Thailand and Australia. Initially TrueConf software was designed to provide stable audio-visual communication on low and unreliable Internet connections. Since launching in 2004, TrueConf has gone on to produce multiple software suites, specialized hardware, and web-based video conferencing programs. TrueConf provides video conferencing services for a number of non-profit social projects, and supports a number of conferences devoted to developing inclusive education in Russia and elsewhere.[1] The company was established by young employees of MSU Computer Graphics Department. The company was launched in 2003. The first official software was presented in summer 2003. MSU soon took interest in the new development. The university was the first customer of the original Visicron company. In that same year, several Russian companies and state educational establishments became the first clients of TrueConf. The technology was specially designed to work on low (approximately 128 kbit/s) and unreliable channels. This limitation was conditioned by peculiarities of local Internet connections in the years 2002-2003.[2] As network technology developed, the recommended internet requirements grew up to 256 Kb/s along with video and audio quality. TrueConf developed a video codec, Cyclon, which is designed especially for video conferencing. TrueConf experts said that featuring adaptive noise reduction, Cyclon was designed to be able to detect moving objects and recognize the positioning of hands and faces as they appeared on video feed. This facial recognition algorithm (licensed by Vicinium) enabled acceptable visual quality with connection speeds of only 20-40 kbit/s.[3] In October 2010 the WebM video codec (VP8) became the default for all TrueConf products. Cyclon is still used, but only on computers with insufficient CPU efficiency (Pentium III or less), enabling videoconferencing on older computers and narrow connections.[4] In 2011, TrueConf demonstrated prototypes of its latest developments: TrueConf 3D (the first solution for 3D video conferencing), TrueConf Mobile for the Android devices, and TrueConf Terminal, their hardware video conferencing system[5][5][6] As of 2011, TrueConf supports high definition video with resolutions approximating 720p and 720p at 30 frames per second.[7] In 2010 the TrueConf Server software was cracked by a 23 year old man from Yekaterinburg. The hacker distributed cracked versions of TrueConf software via email and subject websites, but was caught distributing the software and prosecuted.[8] TrueConf has a long experience of cooperative work with Regional Society of Disabled People Perspektiva, a Russian Non-Governmental Organization. During their collaboration, TrueConf has developed a free video application designed for people who suffer from hearing disorders. VZOmobile is a disability-inclusive application for communicators and smartphones that enables visual communication on the Windows Mobile platform. This solution was also the basis for TrueConf Mobile, a client application for mobile devices using the Android platform.[1][9] Among other projects that TrueConf company supported was the international online video conference devoted to including children with disabilities in public education. At the conference, Keith Venables, the founder of Educational Psychologists for Inclusion Organization and British scholar of educational psychology, shared his experience with Russian experts.[1][10] In October 2010, a theoretical and practical conference devoted to the problem of IT implementation into modern ophthalmology was held with TrueConf's support. Visual broadcasting of cataract phacoemulsification and microinvasive glaucoma surgery between Moscow and Madras was provided by TrueConf.[1][11] TrueConf also supports non-profit educational events. The 9th International Internet Contest "Erudite of the planet 2010", workshop "The day of Free Access to Information" and a number of events was held under TrueConf technical support.[1] TrueConf leading product line TrueConf Server  dedicated video conferencing software server; TrueConf Online  cloud-based video conferencing service TrueConf Terminal  hardware-based system for visual communication; TrueConf Gateway  inter operability solution that enables connection between of H.323/SIP devices to TrueConf Server; TrueConf under development TrueConf Mobile  client application for mobile devices on the Android platform; TrueConf 3D  soft- and hardware based solution that enables 3D visual communication. TrueConf solutions were acknowledged as the Project of the Year 2007 according to PC Magazine Re Russian edition of which is published under license from Ziff-Davis Inc., New York. TrueConf solutions were also acknowledged as Success of the Year 2010 in the category "Video" according to LAN magazine. The victory was achieved due to development of company's own decoder Cyclon - it is fully adapted to Russian conditions and provides business-quality video and sound on channels with low quality (128 kbps).[1] In March 2011, TrueConf demonstrated the first Russian solution for 3D video conferences.[5] TrueConf 3D was acknowledged as Break of the Year 2011 according to LAN magazine [12] The first Russian hardware-based solution TrueConf Terminal was also developed by TrueConf experts.[5] (Russian)
