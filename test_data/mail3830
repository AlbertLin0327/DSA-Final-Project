MMSI Number: 235061705 IMO number: 9437969 MV Pentalina is a 70m RoPax catamaran ferry purchased by Pentland Ferries in 2008 to operate between Gills Bay, Caithness and St Margaret's Hope, Orkney. MV Pentalina was built in Cebu, Philippines, starting in February 2007. She was ready to launch in April 2008, but there were delays in installing equipment. The 10,000 mile journey from the Philippines to Scotland was delayed by bad weather, forcing a short detour to Salalah, Oman.[1] She arrived in St Margaret's Hope on 9 December 2008,[2] and entered service by 30 March 2009.[citation needed] MV Pentalina was designed by the naval architects, Sea Transport Solutions of Australia. The catamaran form has a steel hull with aluminum superstructure.[3] She is a highly technical vessel designed to handle the rough seas off the north coast of Scotland.[1] Her overall length is 70m, beam 20m. She has been fitted out with a sundeck and two lounges. MV Pentalina replaced MV Claymore, crossing the Pentland Firth, between Gills Bay, Caithness and St Margaret's Hope, Orkney.[4] She makes the crossing in one hour.[4]
