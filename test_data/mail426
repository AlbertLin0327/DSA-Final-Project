FRAS1-related extracellular matrix protein 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the FREM2 gene.[1][2] This gene encodes a membrane protein that belongs to the FRAS1 family. This extracellular matrix protein is thought to be required for maintaining the integrity of the skin epithelium and the differentiated state of renal epithelia. The protein localizes to the basement membrane, forming a ternary complex that plays a role in epidermal-dermal interactions during morphogenetic processes. Mutations in this gene are associated with Fraser syndrome.[2]  FACIT: type IX (COL9A1, COL9A2, COL9A3) type XII (COL12A1) COL14A1 COL16A1 COL19A1 COL20A1 COL21A1 COL22A1 basement membrane: type IV (COL4A1, COL4A2, COL4A3, COL4A4, COL4A5, COL4A6) multiplexin: COL15A1 type XVIII (COL18A1, Endostatin) transmembrane: COL13A1 COL17A1 COL23A1 COL25A1
