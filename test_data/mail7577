Busbridge Church, formerly known as St John the Baptist Church, is an evangelical Anglican Church in Busbridge, Godalming, United Kingdom. Busbridge Church is part of a joint benefice with Hambledon Church [1] in the village of Hambledon, Surrey. Together Busbridge and Hambledon Church have six Sunday congregations ranging from traditional to modern and contemporary services.[2] On a Sunday Busbridge Church and Hambledon Church put on youth and children's groups for over 200 young people.[3] Busbridge Church was founded by Mr and Mrs Ramsden of Busbridge Hall. Building work took place between 1865 and 1967 and finished with the building's dedication in 1867. On a Sunday morning there is the Quiet Service at 8:30am. They share Holy Communion every two weeks and follow both the book of Common Worship and the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. The service is approximately half an hour long and is led by robed clergy or LLMs.[4] Classic congregation then meets in Busbridge Church from 10.00am till 11.00am. They also follow Common Worship and host an all age service on the first Sunday of each month. Holy Communion is celebrated on the second and fourth Sundays. The worship and music style is both traditional with contemporary songs and hymns with the aid of a church organ.[2] The 6:30 is an informal evening service with extended periods of music and a relaxed atmosphere. Holy Communion is on the first Sunday of evening month.[5] Simultaneous with the Classic Service a contemporary congregation meets across the road in Busbridge Junior School. Worship is band lead and there is regular use of modern media. Holy Communion is on the third Sunday.[6]
