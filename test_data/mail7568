Valkyrie plass is a former subway station on the Oslo Metro. The station was opened when the Holmenkoll Line was extended from Majorstuen to Nationaltheatret on 28 June 1928.[1] The station was built in newclassic style, and architect was Kristofer Andreas Lange. Though not originally planned, when 800 m of the street collapsed during the construction of the first parts of Fellestunnelen, a station was built anyway. It was closed in 1985 due to the nearness to Majorstuen, and it was both difficult and dangerous to expand the station to accommodate trains with more than two cars (which was needed for the conversion of the western lines to metro). Valkyrie plass was also a light rail station on the Briskeby Line of the Oslo Tramway, between Schultz gate in the east and the terminus Majorstuen in the west.[2] The former station building is now used for a snack bar, but the staircase to the platform is maintained to provide access to emergency and maintenance personnel. Inside the former station there were illuminated billboards behind the platforms, however as of August 2011 only the Backlights remain.
