The Light is a 1987 composition by Philip Glass, his first score for a full symphony orchestra. The work was commissioned for the Michelson-Morley Centennial Celebration held at Case Western Reserve University. The musical structure is inspired by the 1887 MichelsonMorley experiment, an investigation of the speed of light that marked a turning point in modern science.
