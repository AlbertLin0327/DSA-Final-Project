April Flores (born April 30, 1976 in Los Angeles County, California)[1][2][6][note 1] is an American pornographic actress and plus-size model. Flores has stated to have come from a strict religious family.[2] She is Ecuadorian from her fathers side[2] and Mexican from her mothers side, and she calls herself Mexidorian.[7] When Flores was a child, she said she wanted to be a plastic surgeon simply because they made a lot of money.[2] She had struggled with weight issues since childhood and wanted to be slim, but she abandoned the idea after losing weight in college and then concluding that life was just the same.[2] Flores began her career doing pictorials for plus-size womens magazines like Bizarre,[2] Juggs[3] and Big Butt Magazine (the latter of which she appeared on the cover on two separate occasions).[8] In 2001[8] she began doing photo shoots for photographer Carlos Batts (who later became her husband).[9] They eventually moved from photos to amateur film; at one point Batts also had fellow porn actress Belladonna as one of his clients. Belladonna and Flores began doing photo shoots together; this led to the two appearing in the film Evil Pink 2. This movie was Flores first filmed sex scene[9] as well as her first actual sexual experience; she lost her virginity to Belladonna on film.[2] Despite this, Flores considers Alter Ego to be her first official film.[9] She also considers herself an erotic entertainer rather than a porn star.[8] Flores is bisexual but she has only done girl/girl scenes.[8] She is married to Carlos Batts; and she cites Jean Val Jean as her favorite porn star that she has yet to work with.[9] She has also revealed that red is not her natural hair color.[9] Tattoo artist Coop considers Flores his muse.[2] In 2009, sex toy company Topco released Voluptuous Pussy, a life-size inflatable doll named after Flores vagina but modeled as an exact replica of her entire body.[4] It is touted as the first realistic plus-size sex toy, and it is made out of Cyberskin material.[4]
