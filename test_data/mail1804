"Different Than You" was the first single from The Exies new album, A Modern Way of Living with the Truth. This was first announced on the Exies webpage. Scott Stevens said "the song is about breaking down boundaries" at an acoustic performance. This song is also used in the feature film, National Lampoon's Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
