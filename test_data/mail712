The Battle of Bassianae was a battle between Ostrogoths and Huns in 468. Recovering from the defeat at Nedao in 454, the Hunnic leader Dengizich launched an invasion across the Danube with a large Hun force, but was defeated by the Ostrogothic king Valamir. Jordanes writes that in turn the Huns "for ever after" left the Goths in peace.[1] 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
