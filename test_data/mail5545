Arrow is a radio format that plays "classic hits" from the late 1970s through the early 1980s among other selections. The format was briefly popular in a number of markets. The word "Arrow" is an extended acronym for "All Rock-and-Roll Oldies". Many Arrow stations were owned by Infinity Broadcasting and scattered throughout the United States. The flagship station for Arrow was KCBS-FM which aired the format from 1993-2001 until switching to classic rock. Arrow in Holland is close to the original format (although also playing "classic hits" from later decades) 675 AM or on FM cable in the Netherlands (see [1]). Although since 2004 the Arrow-company also operates a jazz station with the name Arrow Jazz FM Currently 93.1 KCBS is one of a few Infinity stations that flipped to the adult hits format
