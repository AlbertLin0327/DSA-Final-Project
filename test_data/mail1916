The Tachikawa Ki-74 was a Japanese experimental long-range reconnaissance bomber of World War II. A twin-engine, mid-wing monoplane, it was developed for the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force but did not enter service. Though already conceived in 1939[1] as a long-range reconnaissance aircraft capable of reaching west of Lake Baikal when operating from bases in Manchukuo (Manchuria), the prototype Ki-74 (designated as A-26 by Tachikawa) only first flew as late as in March 1944; it was powered by two 1,641 kW (2,200 hp) Mitsubishi Ha-211-I radial engines. The following two prototypes were powered by the turbo-supercharged Mitsubishi Ha-211-I Ru, but as these experienced teething troubles, the following thirteen pre-production machines substituted the Ha-211 Ru engine for the lower powered, but more reliable, turbo-supercharged Mitsubishi Ha-104 Ru[2]. The Ki-74 did not see operational service. Nevertheless, the Allies knew of its existence and assigned the type the codename "Patsy" after it was discovered that is was a bomber, not a fighter. Previously it had the code name "Pat" in Allied Intelligence[3].
