Star in the Dust (also released as Law Man) is a 1956 American western film made by Universal International Pictures and starring John Agar, Mamie Van Doren, and Richard Boone. Sheriff Bill Jorden, (the Sheriff of Gunlock) is due to hang Sam Hall for cattle-stealing. Jorden has to contend, however, with various citizens, including the cowboys who want to rescue Hall and the cattle farm|cattle-farmers who want to lynch him. Hall, meanwhile, is planning his escape with his girlfriend Nellie.[1] The film is probably most notable today for marking an early appearance of Clint Eastwood, although he played a very small role as a ranch hand. The Gunlock Town Sheriff (John Agar) is planning to hang Sam Hall (Richard Boone) for shooting three farmers found on cattle land at sundown. At the casino, betting odds are 8 to 3 he won't make it. The cattlemen are set to rescue Sam; the farmers hope to lynch him before he can be rescued; and Hall schemes for escape with his girl Nellie (Coleen Gray). But Sheriff Jorden is most concerned with finding out who hired Hall: a leading suspect is the sheriff's future brother-in-law.[2]
