 Appearances (Goals). Benjamin "Ben" Chapman (born 2 March 1979) is an English professional footballer who plays as a left back for Northern Counties East League side Appleby Frodingham. He notably played in the Football League for Grimsby Town where he started his career, and then Boston United where he was club captain. He has since forged a career in Non-league playing for Alfreton Town, Northwich Victoria, Nuneaton Borough, King's Lynn, Eastwood Town, Harrogate Town, Frickley Athletic and Hall Road Rangers. Chapman came through the youth ranks with professional club Grimsby Town and signed professionally with The Mariners in 1997. He made his first team debut for the club in a 1-0 victory over local rivals Hull City in the Football League Trophy in January 1998. He would have to wait another 18 months before he was called up for action again, and made a run out against Watford . Ben was used as the clubs reserve left back and was understudy to Tony Gallimore, Chapman only managed 2 appearances in both the 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 season and would have to wait until the 2001-2002 campaign before he started to have a regular run in first team affairs. Notably that season Chapman played for Grimsby on both Anfield and Highbury as Grimsby recorded a historic cup win over Liverpool before being knocked out by Arsenal. In the Liverpool game, a Grimsby corner resulted in Chapman volleying just close over the crossbar and was Grimsby's only clear cut chance in the first half of play. He would go on to never get on the score sheet for the club. While playing for Grimsby, Chapman was responsible for ending the career of Scunthorpe United midfielder Peter Morrison during a pre season friendly in 2001. The game was abandoned as a result of the injury, and eventually following court proceedings, Morrison was rewarded a 400,000 compensation pay out.[1] In July 2002 Grimsby captured Welsh International left back Darren Barnard on a free transfer thus resulting in Chapman's release from the club. He signed for Boston United and became the teams captain, and was able to give his new team mates a helping hand as The Pilgrims avoided relegation from the Third Division. Ben stayed with Boston until the end of the 2003-2004 season, and after that he was released. After spending a week training with his former club Grimsby and appearing in a pre-season friendly, Ben went on to sign for Non League side Alfreton Town for a season, before linking up Northwich Victoria the following season, in his only season with the Vics he helped the club gain promotion from the Conference North division. He then went on to join Nuneaton Borough for the 2006-2007 season. In the summer of 2007 Chapman joined King's Lynn.He stayed with The Linnets until March 2009, where he signed for Eastwood Town. Chapman was released two months later following the end of the season, and joined Harrogate Town in October 2009. He went on to play for Frickley Athletic before moving to Hall Road Rangers in July 2011.
