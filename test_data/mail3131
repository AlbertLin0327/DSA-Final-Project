Inishbofin (Inis B Finne in Irish, meaning Island of the White Cow ) is an island off the coast of Machaire Rabhartaigh (Magheraroarty), County Donegal, Ireland. It is a 120-hectare (300 acre) land mass long known as a fishing and farming village, a place where generations of inhabitants have spoken Irish. The current population numbers about 36.[1] There are no pubs or shops on the island. There is a boat service to and from it but no regular ferry.
