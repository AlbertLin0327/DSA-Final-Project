Mohammad Saleem (Urdu  ) better known as Saleem Javed is a Pakistani pop singer born in Hyderabad, Pakistan. He emerged to fame in the 1980s,[1] though, he was already known in some quarters before that, as a semi-classical singer due to his work in the classical industry. Saleem Javed practically started the trend of Re-Mixing old songs with new instrumentation and improvisation 23 years ago. He did the first ever re-mix in Pakistan in his first album Listen to My Voice launched in 1985 and the song was " Janam Aii Janam by Legendary Madom Noor Jehan ".[2]
