Monsignor Scanlan High School is a private, Roman Catholic high school in the Bronx, New York City. It is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. Monsignor Scanlan High School was initially established in 1949 as two schools, St. Helena's High School for Boys and St. Helena's High School for Girls. Both schools were formed by Monsignor Arthur J. Scanlan, founding pastor of St. Helena's Church. He also founded the parish elementary school in 1940. Both high schools were renamed in Scanlan's honor in 1972 and merged into one coeducational high school in 1976. The parish also operated a commercial high school from 1956 to 2002. The school is located at the foot of the Whitestone Bridge, connecting Queens and the Bronx. Students residing in the Bronx and Queens constitute the majority of the pupil population. [2]
