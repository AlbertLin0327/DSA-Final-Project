Dreikanter Head (7653S 16230E / 76.883S 162.5E / -76.883; 162.5Coordinates: 7653S 16230E / 76.883S 162.5E / -76.883; 162.5) is a dark triangular headland between the mouths of Hunt Glacier and Marston Glacier, on the west side of Granite Harbour, Victoria Land. The triangular appearance of the feature when viewed from the southeast suggests the name; "Dreikantig" is a German word meaning triangular.[1] This article incorporatespublic domain material from the United States Geological Survey document "Dreikanter Head" (content from the Geographic Names Information System).
