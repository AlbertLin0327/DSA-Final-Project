Brian Jacks (born 5 October 1946)[1] is a British judoka who won Britain's first medal at a world championship, taking a bronze in Salt Lake City in 1967,[2] and gained a second bronze at the 1972 Munich Olympics.[1] Brian Jacks later achieved national fame for his outstanding performances on the BBC programme Superstars.[3] in which he was one of the most successful competitors. Jacks dominated the British and European version of the contest from 1979 to 1980, winning four titles. Jacks was most famous for his amazing efforts in the gymnasium, where he repeatedly set records in the "gym tests", including 100 parallel bar dips in 60 seconds in the 1981 Challenge of the Champions, and 118 squat thrusts in the 1980 World Final. He was also very dominant in the weightlifting, canoeing and cycling events, rarely placing lower than second. Unfortunately, Jacks was never able to win the World Superstars title, being forced to miss the 1979 event through illness and finishing third in 1980. In 1981 he was beaten for the first time in Europe (by Keith Fielding) and would never again compete in Superstars. His victories in the British and European Superstars lead to the creation of the branded computer games: Brian Jacks Superstar Challenge and Brian Jacks Uchi Mata. He attributed his great performances in the "gym test" to the benefits of eating numerous oranges. After retiring from judo he opened a fitness and martial arts club, and in 1990 he started a company hiring bouncy castles. In 1984 he briefly appeared on the BBC show Micro Live, where he set up his new Atari 800XL with his family.[4] Jacks lives in Pattaya, Thailand and runs a 60 room hotel/condo building.[5] European Champions:  1975 Kjell Isaksson  1976 Kjell Isaksson  1977 Ties Kruize  1978 No Competition  1979 Ties Kruize  1979 Brian Jacks
