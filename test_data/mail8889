AirSols was an abbreviation of Air Solomons, the Allied air units in the Solomon Islands campaign of World War II, from April 1943 to June 1944. Its units came from the United States Navy (USN), United States Marine Corps (USMC), United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF). AirSols superseded and absorbed the Cactus Air Force of 194243. It was under the Allied Supreme Command known as Pacific Ocean Areas (POA). RNZAF units that formed part of the command included at times No. 14 Squadron RNZAF and No. 15 Squadron RNZAF. The Allied fliers fought the Japanese 11th Air Fleet and 4th Air Army, based at Rabaul, New Britain. On 15 June 1944, AirSols was replaced by AirNorSols (Air North Solomons), which would have 40 squadrons (including 23 USMC squadrons). That same day, responsibility for Allied units west of 159 East Longitude and south of the Equator passed from POA to the South West Pacific Area (SWPA). However, seven USAAF squadrons in AirNorSols were transferred, as part of the Thirteenth Air Force, to the U.S. Far East Air Forces (SWPA) and eight USN and RNZAF squadrons were moved to garrison duty in South Pacific.
