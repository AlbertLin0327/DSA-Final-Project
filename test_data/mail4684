Coordinates: 534218N 13849W / 53.705N 1.647W / 53.705; -1.647 Staincliffe is a cross-over district of both Batley, West Yorkshire, England and Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, England; the name is believed to derive from staine, meaning stone and cliffe, cliff.[citation needed] It should not be confused with the Staincliffe (wapentake). The area is centred on top of a hill between Dewsbury, Batley and Heckmondwike, and areas south of Halifax Road, including Dewsbury & District Hospital have Dewsbury postal addresses. Until the nineteenth century, the hamlet of Staincliffe consisted of Staincliffe Hall (dating from at least the seventeenth century) a few farms and some eighteenth century cottages, many of which survive amongst the later developments. Staincliffe expanded in the nineteenth century with the growth of the heavy woollen industry. In 1867, a new parish church of Christ Church Staincliffe was consecrated which, along with the Vicarage and Church School, was designed by William Henry Crossland. Today Staincliffe has many nineteenth century houses, but also contains a couple of council housing estates built during the 1950s, as well as a mix of small shops along Halifax Road.
