Vn Canh is a rural district (huyn) of Binh Dinh province in the South Central Coast region of Vietnam. The district capital is Van Canh.[2] Van Canh district is mountainous district, located in the south-west of Binh Dinh Province, and is relatively sparsely populated. Van Canh borders ng Xun District of Phu Yen province to the south, the districts of An Nhn, Ty Sn and Tuy Phc to the north, and Kng Chro District of Gia Lai province to the west. H Thanh River has its source and flows through the district. There are seven administrative units at communal level, in which Vn Canh Town was established and in addition to the communes of Canh Ha, Canh Thun, Canh Hip, Canh Hin, Canh Vinh and Canh Lin. There are three ethnic groups living in the district, Kinh, Cham people and BaNa. The Cham are mainly concentrated mainly in Canh Ho, Bana ethnic concentration in Canh Lin, Canh Thun, Canh Hip, where they exceed 40% of the total population. The Cham people settled in the mountainous area along with the indigenous tribes after the kingdom of Champa was dismantled in 1471. As a result, the Cham have adopted many facets of Bana culture. Most of the communes of Van Canh district lie on the provincial road 638 between Dieu Tri and Phu Yen Province. Transport facilities have been improved in recent years, allowing increasing economic activity and development. However, infrastructure in the remote Canh Lien commune in the west of the district is still primitive. Vietnam's NorthSouth Railway passes through this district. However, there is no railway station.[3] The standard of living is low, and the poverty rate high. The land is rather infertile and a lack of irrigation water compounds the poor productivity. In recent years, the sugar cane industry has developed substantially, and the sugar cane factory of Binh Dinh has grown, producing more economic opportunities. The area has a lot of idle grassland that can be exploited for grazing. The area has abundance of natural forests as well as planted ones.
