2DN8, 2HJW, 2KCC, 3FF6, 3GID, 3GLK, 3JRW, 3JRX, 3TDC Acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 also known as ACC-beta or ACC2 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ACACB gene.[1][2] Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) is a complex multifunctional enzyme system. ACC is a biotin-containing enzyme which catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, the rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis. ACC-beta is thought to control fatty acid oxidation by means of the ability of malonyl-CoA to inhibit carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, the rate-limiting step in fatty acid uptake and oxidation by mitochondria. ACC-beta may be involved in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation, rather than fatty acid biosynthesis.[1] Human acetyl-CoA carboxylase has recently become a target in the design of new anti-obesity drugs.[3] However when the gene for ACC2 was knocked out in mice, no change in body weight was observed relative to normal mice.[4] This result suggests inhibition of ACC2 by drugs may be an ineffective method of treating obesity. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
