Archives for UFO Research (AFU) (Swedish: Arkivet fr UFO-forskning) is a depository dedicated to collecting materials about UFOs, ufology, Forteana, cryptozoology, paranormal phenomena and folklore.[1] AFU is a nonprofit foundation situated in Norrkping, Sweden.[2] The collections include 15,000 books in various languages, 40,000 magazine issues representing 5,000 annual magazines, 50,000 newspaper clippings, photographs, films, tape records, memorabilia, and more.[3] AFU also possesses Scandinavian archives, including over 30,000 reports and collections about organizational and personal files.[further explanation needed] The archive collects scale models, paintings, paraphernalia, posters, clothes, toys, and other items.[1] Archives for UFO Research was founded in Sdertlje in 1973 by Hkan Blomqvist, Kjell Jonsson, and Anders Liljegren. The purpose was to provide information for UFO researchers and build a specialized research library for UFO literature.[4] In 1980, AFU was converted to a charitable foundation and the archive was moved to its current location in Norrkping. Through a special agreement in 1986, AFU is connected to the national organization UFO-Sweden, and takes the role of managing the organization's archives and libraries. The daily operation is run by a permanent staff and entirely on a voluntary basis by contributions from private sponsors.[4] AFU stores UFO reports submitted and documented by private and military investigators in Sweden. The archive manages UFO-Sweden's report archive. Material is continuously being added material from the organization's central and field investigators. The report archive includes about 20,000 Swedish observations and copies of all available open UFO investigations since 1946 made by the Swedish Armed Forces (about 2,000 cases, mostly ghost rockets Swedish: spkraketer). The archive has received donations of comprehensive report archives from Norway, Denmark, and others. The book collection includes about 20,000 titles. Besides UFO and ufology, the collections contains material on Forteana, cryptozoology, folklore, myths, psychology of religion, mysticism, parapsychology, paranormal phenomena, astronomy, military history, intelligence, and aviation history. AFU has its own separate classification system  Ufocode.[further explanation needed] AFU is a international archive and library and books in the collections are written in different languages, mainly English, German, French, Spanish, and Swedish. Journals from around the world that are within the scope of the archive topics are saved regularly. The archives currently have about 30,000 booklets. The collection includes all kinds of regularly published writings from religious cults newsletters to comics with scientific ambitions. Most of the journals describe reported UFO cases and debate of UFO topics in different parts of the world.
