Jackson Heights is a residential neighbourhood in the Mill Woods area of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It is located in the Burnewood area of Mill Woods. The neighbourhood was named in 1976 after Annie May Jackson. Jackson "became the first female police officer in Canada when she was appointed to the Edmonton Police Department in 1912."[1] It is a newer neighbourhood with virtually all residential construction occurring after 1990.[2] The most common type of residence in the neighbourhood is the single family dwelling, accounting for 88% of all residences. Another 10% of the residences are row houses. There are also a few residences that are other types of dwelling. Virtually all (97%) of residences are owner occupied.[3] There is a single school in the neighbourhood, Jackson Heights Elementary School, operated by the Edmonton Public School Board. The Annie May Jackson Park is located in the neighbourhood. The neighbourhood is bounded on the north by Whitemud Drive and on the west by 50 Street. The very southern tip runs for about a block along 40 Avenue. The south east boundary is marked by a utility corridor that runs from 40 Avenue just east of 50 Street to the intersection of 34 Street and Whitemud Drive. The Edmonton Transit System has several bus stops in the area for the 68, 760, 775, 778, 784, 785, 917, and 918 bus routes.
