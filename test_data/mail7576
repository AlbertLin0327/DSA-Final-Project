At a press conference, Rosell said that he was shocked by his former girlfriend's decision to end their long relationship. He admitted that Lewandowski left him for another guy.[14] In 2010, Rosell briefly dated model Aze Sasaki.[15] Rosell is now taking a one-year celibacy as he is currently on a "journey of life and self-discovery."[16] A known advocate for the environment, Rosell took part in the shore clean-up activity in Boracay on Apr 2012 and stated that every effort--great and small--is needed to save Mother Nature.[17]
