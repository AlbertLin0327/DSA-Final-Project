The Opposite Sex is a 1956 musical film.[1][2] It is a remake of the 1939 classic comedy The Women. Both films are based on Claire Boothe Luce's original play. The 1956 musical was directed by David Miller and stars June Allyson, Joan Collins, Dolores Gray, Ann Sheridan, Ann Miller, Leslie Nielsen, Jeff Richards, Agnes Moorehead, Charlotte Greenwood, Joan Blondell, Sam Levene, Dick Shawn, Jim Backus, Bill Goodwin and Harry James. The story concerns Kay Hilliard (played by June Allyson), a former nightclub singer who discovers her husband Steven (played by Leslie Nielsen) is having an affair with showgirl Crystal Allen (played by Joan Collins). Kay is the last to find out among her circle of gossiping girlfriends. Kay travels to Reno to divorce from Steve who then marries Crystal, but when Kay finds out that Crystal isn't true to Steve she starts fighting to win her ex-husband back. Unlike its predecessor, the cast includes male actors to play husbands and boyfriends, whose characters were only referred to in the previous film and stage versions. This alters the structure and tone of the base storyline significantly. Dick Shawn and Jim Backus appear in a stage number singing the title song. Harry James and his band are seen and heard in a flashback musical number "Young Man and His Horn." Originally, MGM studio head Dore Schary envisioned Esther Williams in June Allyson's role. According to her 2000 autobiography, The Million Dollar Mermaid, she objected to Schary's casting suggestion, resulting in her suspension from the studio. Shortly after, on agent Lew Wasserman's advice, she left Metro after fourteen years. Jo Ann Greer dubbed Allyson's ballad "A Perfect Love" and ironically also sang for Williams in her last MGM musical, Jupiter's Darling (film). The film was nominated for a Golden Globe.
