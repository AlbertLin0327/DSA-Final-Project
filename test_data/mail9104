The steam locomotives of Sdbahn Class23 (old) were goods train engines worked by the Austrian Southern Railway (sterreichische Sdbahn). The precursors to the Austrian Southern Railway had a very disparate fleet of goods locomotives. The Southern Railway therefore had a six-coupled freight locomotive developed which was based the French Bourbonnais prototype. This series was initially given the designation 23, but was reclassified to 29 in 1864. The Lokomotivfabrik der StEG engine works delivered 20 units in 1860, which proved themselves so well that a total of 205 were built up to 1872 by this factory along with the Wiener Neustdter Lokomotivfabrik and Maschinenfabrik Esslingen. In the course of time there were naturally several modifications: in 1861 to the driver's cab, in the 1880s a vacuum brake with sound absorbers, new boilers, etc... After nationalisation in 1924 the Federal Railway of Austria (BB) took over 47 units, that were grouped into BB Class 49. Yugoslavia designated the locomotives that it received as J124.[1] In Hungary they became MV 332 and in Italy FS193. After the Second World War a few engines, classified by the Deutsche Reichsbahn asDRG 53.71117116, remained in Austria. Of these, the BB only took over number 153.7114 but withdrew her in 1953. During the 1920s the BB sold several engines to the GKB. One of them, number GKB671, is still working today, albeit with some small modifications such as compressed-air brakes thanks to the work of the Steirischen Eisenbahnfreunde (Styrian Railway Society). Built in 1860, the Austrian-made Sdbahn Class 23 (old) locomotive on the Graz-Kflach railway (GKB), is the longest serving steam engine in the world. It is frequently on duty and is used to haul steam specials.
