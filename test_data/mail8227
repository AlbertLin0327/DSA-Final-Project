The flag of Guyana, known as The Golden Arrowhead, has been the national flag of Guyana since May 1966 when the country became independent from the United Kingdom. It was designed by Whitney Smith, an American vexillologist (though originally without the black and white fimbriations, which were later additions suggested by the College of Arms in the United Kingdom). The proportions of the national flag are 3:5. The colours are symbolic, with green for agriculture and forests, white for rivers and water, gold for mineral wealth, black for endurance, and red for zeal and dynamism.  The civil air ensign is a copy of the British Civil Air Ensign, with the Guyanese flag in the canton. The naval ensign of Guyana is a stretched version of the national flag, with proportions of 1:2. As part of the British Empire, Guyana's flag was a British Blue Ensign with the colonial badge in the fly. An unofficial red version was used at sea.[2] The first flag was introduced in 1875 and was changed slightly in 1906 and 1955.[3] Like all British Ensigns, the colonial flags of Guyana were all ratio 1:2.
