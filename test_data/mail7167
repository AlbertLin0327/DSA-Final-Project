Infraspeed is the builder and infrastructure maintenance company of the HSL-Zuid high speed line in the Netherlands. Infraspeed BV was created in 1999 by a consortium of Fluor Infrastructure (part of Fluor Corporation), Siemens Nederland (subsidiary of Siemens) and Royal BAM Group, in 2000 financial investors Innisfree and Charterhouse Project Equity (after 2002, named HSBC infrastructure Ltd, see HSBC) began to participate in the company, taking a 49% shareholding.[1] [2] In 2001 the company obtained a PPP contract with the Dutch state to build and maintain a new 100km high speed line in the Netherlands, running from Amsterdam to the Belgian border. (see HSL-Zuid). The contract included financing, designing and construction of the line; 5 years, 2001 to 2006, and maintenance of the line; 25 years, 2006 to 2031. The contract excluded operation of the line, and construction of the earthwork for the line. Fluor provided project management for the scheme, Royal BAM Group installed the track system and barriers, Siemens Nederland provided the electrical power supply system (25kV AC), and signalling system, including ETCS and GSM-R equipment. Financing of the project cost $1.32 billion. The track construction phase was completed by Dec 2006.[1] In 2011 Siemens sold its stake in the company to HSBC and Innisfree; resulting in the two companies controlling ~86% of the shares.[2]
