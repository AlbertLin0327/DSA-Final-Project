Holly & Fearne Go Dating is a Reality TV show which first aired on ITV on September 5, 2007. In the six-part first series, Holly Willoughby and Fearne Cotton embarked on a mission each episode to find not one but two ideal matches for one of love's losers. One will be Fearne's choice, the other Holly's. The show culminated with a dinner date at the Hell's Kitchen restaurant in London. Here, the lonely heart got to enjoy the company of both dates, one after the other. However, by the end of the night one date would be left standing. The lonely heart had to make a choice of either Fearne's date, or Holly's. It is unlikely that the show will be returning, or at least not to the main ITV Network. Holly Willoughby recently revived similar series, Streetmate on ITV2.
