Father Luis Cancer or Fray Luis de Cancer (died June 26, 1549) was a Dominican priest and pioneer Spanish missionary to the New World. He was born at Barbastro, in Aragon. Luis entered the Dominican order and was inspired like many of his time to go to the New World in an effort to spread Christianity. Fray de Cancer came to the New World in 1518 and worked successfully for some time among the native peoples of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. He then ventured to the mainland and had particular success in Guatemala. A disciple of the famed Indian protector, Bartolom de las Casas, Father de Cancer's efforts were so successful in an area that was known for its bellicose natives, that it was renamed the Province of True Peace. He believed that aggression and violence were counter-productive to the spread of the Gospel and that the native peoples needed to be treated with dignity. He had great success in pacifying the Indians whom more violent methods had failed to subdue. He upheld the cause of the natives at an ecclesiastical assembly held in Mexico in 1546. Having read of the several failed expeditionary attempts to Florida, de Cancer felt that a true missionary effort needed to be undertaken. By late 1547 he had received permission to undertake such an expedition. The Santa Maria de la Encina set out from Vera Cruz, Mexico in early 1549 with de Cancer and three other Dominicans bound for Florida. He insisted that it be an unarmed vessel. Father de Cancers high ideals were put to the test as he arrived on the shores of Tampa Bay in late May 1549. Undoubtedly marred by previous contacts with Spanish Conquistadors, the native peoples were very suspicions of this latest venture. Undeterred, de Cancer spent about six weeks in the Tampa Bay area making numerous contacts with the native Tocobaga. Ignoring warnings from the captain, de Cancer pressed onward and continued to make continued contact with the natives, despite the fact that one of the other Dominicans had already disappeared. On June 25, 1549 he celebrated mass ashore on the Feast of Corpus Christi. The next day Fray Luis de Cancer, a man of peace and Gospel virtue was martyred by a band of Indians shortly after setting ashore, and in the sight of his companions. His last words were Adjuva me, Domine" ("Help me,Lord"). His death sent shock waves through the Dominican missionary community in New Spain. Though not a canonized saint, he is nevertheless regarded as the Proto-martyr of Florida. In 1860, Bishop Augustin Verot decided that the first parish on Floridas West Coast should be named St. Louis Church in his honor. In 1998, the Diocese of St. Petersburg established the Fr. Luis de Cancer Distinguished Priestly Service Award to be given annually to a priest of the Diocese of St. Petersburg who best exemplifies selfless and dedicated service to the people of God. Espiritu Santo Catholic Church in Safety Harbor, Florida which is not far from the location of the incident, has a stained glass window depicting de Cancer's martyrdom.
