Dng Triu V About this soundpronunciation (helpinfo)(born January 1, 1984 in Cam Ranh, Vit Nam) is the stage name of Tun Linh, a singer on the popular Vietnamese diaspora music show Paris By Night. Born into a family of six children as the youngest, Tun Linh showed an early interest in reading and music, especially an ability to remember lyrics and music of songs. His parents were originally from Quang Nam province in central Vit Nam, but due to economic difficulties, moved to Dong Nai and then to the Mekong Delta city of Cam Ranh, where his mother ran a news agency Phng Trm. In 1993, his entire family immigrated to the United States when he was just nine years old, forcing each family member to face the difficulties of living in an unfamiliar country with an unfamiliar language. He was a shy boy, preferring to read rather than socialise. Although Orlando, Florida did not have a large Vietnamese community, the Tt and Tt Trung Thu festivals allowed him to compete in singing competitions. At the 1994 Tt Trung Thu, he won the competition, and completed a hat-trick of victories in the following years. After that he became a soloist, singing at his local church. When he was 13 years old, he participated in the video recording Van Son 9 with the song "Killing Me Softly with His Song". While in high school, he regularly participated in school musical productions, and in year 11, he became the first Asian student at his high school to become the Vice President of the student body. He received various awards, including the United States Achievement Academy, American Legion Award, and was one of 70 students at the school to take the International Baccalaureate. During this time, he also performed with Fantasy, a popular band in Orlando. In 2004 he sent a demo CD with his singing to the Thy Nga headquarters, and one week later received a phone call from the director and an invitation to come to California for a vocal test, as they were concerned that compared to the very young appearance in the photograph, the voice was very mature. The result was the announcement that he would make his debut on the stage of Thy Nga (in Paris By Night). Only a few minutes before this, he announced that he had selected the stage name Dng Triu V. He has since become a regular cast member. In January 2006 he released his debut solo album titled Ngy  C Em (You Were There That Day).
