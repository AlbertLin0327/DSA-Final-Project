Karl Franz Friedrich Chrysander was a German music historian and critic, whose edition of the works of George Frideric Handel and authoritative writings on many other composers established him as a pioneer of 19th-century musicology. Between 1858 and 1902, the Hndel-Gesellschaft or "German Handel Society" edition of Handel's collected works was published, and this was almost entirely the work of Chrysander;[1] Chrysander made a number of publications under the Hndelgesellschaft name (see Hndegesellschaft  volumes with Chrysander as publisher). Chrysander's other publications include: (Reprint of Op. 1)
