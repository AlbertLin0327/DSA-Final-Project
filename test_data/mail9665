2EA6, 2XEU RING finger protein 4 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RNF4 gene.[1][2] The protein encoded by this gene contains a RING finger domain and acts as a transcription factor. This protein has been shown to interact with, and inhibit the activity of, TRPS1, a transcription suppressor of GATA-mediated transcription. Transcription repressor ZNF278/PATZ1 is found to interact with this protein, and thus reduce the enhancement of androgen receptor-dependent transcription mediated by this protein. Studies of the mouse and rat counterparts suggested a role of this protein in spermatogenesis.[2] RNF4 has been shown to interact with TCF20,[3] PATZ1[4][5] and Androgen receptor.[5][6][7]
