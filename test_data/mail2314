The Family Man is a medical drama in three parts, centered on the successful (fictional) Wishart Fertility Clinic which has recently celebrated its 2000th live birth. The patriarch of the clinic is Dr Patrick Stowe (played by Trevor Eve). The drama follows four couples facing a spectrum of fertility problems.
