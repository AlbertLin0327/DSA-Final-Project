China basketball team logo.jpg The Chinese men's national basketball team is the basketball team representing China in international competitions. The governing body of Chinese basketball operations is the Chinese Basketball Association.[1] Based on the number of tournament titles, China has by far the most successful basketball program in Asia. China has traditionally been the basketball power in Asia, and won the FIBA Asian Championship 14 out of 16 times from 1975 to 2005. However, China failed to defend its championship at the 2007 FIBA Asian Championship. This was due to the automatic berth at the 2008 Summer Olympics as the host nation, thus China sent its "B" team to the recent FIBA Asia Championship 2007 and finished 10th [2] while its primary "A" team participated at the 2007 Stankovi Cup which took place around the same time as the FIBA Asian Championship. The team has struggled against top-flight non-Asian teams. However, in recent years, China has shown they can beat top European teams. In the Athens 2004 Olympics China, coached by Del Harris, advanced to the final eight [3] after a 6766 win over defending world champion Serbia and Montenegro. At the 2006 FIBA World Championship, China, coached by Lithuanian Jonas Kazlauskas also advanced to the second round from Group D, earning two victories (against Senegal and Slovenia) in five group play matches before falling in the round of sixteen to eventual silver medallist Greece, 9564; the team's overall placing from amongst the twenty-four competing sides was fifteenth.[4] In 2008, some questions surrounded whether the recently injured Yao Ming could captain the squad. In mid-July, it was confirmed he would.[5] For a report of the 2008 Olympic Team In recent years, team China faced major struggles with injuries. In 2008, top NBA prospect Xu Yong had to end his career at age 19 after being diagnosed with osteosarcoma.[6] In December 2010, Yao Ming was diagnosed with a stress fracture in his left ankle  the injury is related to the ankle sprain that he suffered earlier that year. Speculations arose whether Chinas basketball icon would ever be able to play again.[7] When Yao Ming's retirement was finally announced in July 2011[8] it was a big strike to Team China, whose success had largely depended on the 7-6 (226 cm) giant for many years. Yet, many critics predict team China to keep improving its international performances. Currently, its major threat is Yi Jianlian. When healthy he can compete with the world elite. Other major forces are former NBA-players Wang Zhizhi and Sun Yue, who has improved his performances in recent years. Future hopes are based on players such as NBA prospects Zhou Peng[9], Li Muhao[10] and Guo Ailun.[11]         1936 Olympic Games: finished 15th among 21 teams Shen Yi Tung, Tsai Yen Hung, Wang H.
