William Mervyn Carrick, known as Mervyn Carrick (born 13 February 1946) is a former Unionist politician in Northern Ireland. Born in Portadown, Carrick studied at Portadown Technical College before becoming an accountant. He joined the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and in 1990 was co-opted to Craigavon Borough Council.[1] Carrick was elected to the Northern Ireland Forum in 1996, representing Upper Bann, but unsuccessfully contested the Westminster seat of Upper Bann at the 1997 general election. He held his Stormont seat at the Northern Ireland Assembly election, 1998 and also served as Mayor of Craigavon in 1998-99.[1] Following a dispute over reselection, he joined the other local DUP councillors in standing down for the 2001 election.[2] When he stood as an independent at the 2005 election he was unable to take a seat.[3]
