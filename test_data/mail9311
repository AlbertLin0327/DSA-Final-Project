The Whinlatter Pass is a mountain pass in the English Lake District. It is located on the B5292 road linking Braithwaite, to the west of Keswick, with High Lorton to the south of Cockermouth.[1] To the north the pass is flanked by Whinlatter fell, while to the south the Whiteside, Hopegill Head and Grisedale Pike fells borders the pass. From the top of the pass, paths climb Whinlatter and Grisedale Pike. There is also a Forestry Commission tourist centre there. The Whinlatter Pass is one of three passes that link the tourist area around Keswick, including Derwent Water and Borrowdale, with the valley of the River Cocker, including the lakes of Buttermere, Crummock Water and Loweswater. From north to south these passes are the Whinlatter Pass, the Newlands Pass, and the Honister Pass. The Whinlatter Pass can be icy in winter, but it is a less severe route than the other two passes.[1] Coordinates: 543635N 31454W / 54.6096N 3.2483W / 54.6096; -3.2483
