Technical Senior High School, at 233 12th Avenue South in Saint Cloud, Minnesota, is one of St. Cloud's two major public high schools, the other being Apollo. The school's first building was built in 1917, with another building added in the 1970s to accommodate the student population. St. Cloud Tech offers Advanced Placement courses, and a Senior to Sophomore program together with St. Cloud State University. In addition to this, Post Secondary Enrollment Options (PSEO) classes are offered. Computer class sizes usually range from 15 to 33.[1] Starting in their sophomore year, students can take either AP World History or AP Biology. As students advance through their high school careers, more class options open up, with a total of 19 different AP classes available. In the 1980s and '90s, Tech served as both a senior and junior high school, with grades 7-12 in attendance. The class of 1994 was the last to attend Tech from grade 7 through grade 12. [2] St. Cloud Tech has a number of boys' and girls' sports programs, including football, baseball, basketball, volleyball, gymnastics, golf, softball, hockey, alpine skiing, lacrosse, Nordic skiing, wrestling, soccer, tennis, swimming, cross-country running, track and field and adaptive sports. Tech is in the Central Lakes Conference (www.centrallakesconference.org), competing against other high schools in and around central Minnesota, including its crosstown rival Apollo. Tech's mascot is the Tiger, with its athletic teams sporting the tiger's colors of black and orange. Tech's football team plays across the street from the school at Clark Field, which has been affectionately nicknamed "The Pit" or "The Hole" by opposing school's players. Tech High School has a strong music program, with orchestra, band, and choir as the three major components. Many students take two different music classes. The orchestra, led since 2009 by Kara Mather, is broken into three groups, according to ability: Concert Orchestra, Symphony Orchestra, and Chamber Orchestra. The Chamber Orchestra is a smaller elite team of musicians who have volunteered to practice before school one day a week. It performs at special events in the community, as well as at Tech. Symphony is the primary orchestral group at Tech, and Concert comprises mostly freshman and sophomore students. The band is conducted by Gary Zwack, and the choir by Kevin Kiffmeyer. Starting in the 2012-13 school year, an AP music theory course will be offered, taught by Zwack. The Tech Band and Orchestra have a tradition of going on tour every two years to a major city in the United States. In 2012, the destination was New Orleans, Louisiana, and in 2010 the destination was New York City. The 2014 destination is yet to be determined. A variety of extracurricular activities is also offered at St. Cloud Tech, including Speech, TARGET, Math Team, Students Against Destructive Decisions (SADD), Knowledge Bowl, and National Honor Society. These programs have enabled students to become involved and have helped them develop leadership skills.
