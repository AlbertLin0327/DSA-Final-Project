Ikuo Hirayama (Hirayama Ikuo  , 15 June 1930 - 2 December 2009), was a Japanese Nihonga painter. Born in Setoda-ch, Hiroshima Prefecture, he was famous in Japan for Silk Road paintings of dreamy desert landscapes in Iran, Iraq, and China. In 1952, he graduated from the Tokyo School of Art, or what is today's Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music (popularly known as "Geidai"), and became a disciple of Maeda Seison. Hirayama also served as President of his alma mater twice (198995 and 200105). He produced a series of paintings depicting the introduction of Buddhism to Japan. A hibakusha, he portrayed the A-bomb attack on Hiroshima. He was also active in the preservation of the cultural heritage of the world (e.g., the Bamiyan Buddhas) and is internationally appreciated for his efforts in this sphere. Hirayama was awarded the French Lgion d'honneur Order in 1996 and Japan's Order of Cultural Merit in 1998 amongst others. He was sometimes criticized for his profit making activities at the time when he held a position of President of a national university. Some (would-be) connoisseurs even cast doubts upon the authenticity of his highly profitable artworks, claiming that his wife and others made them under his name. He was a patron of historical institutions and gave 500,000 pounds to the British Museum for the creation of a conservation studio specializing in Eastern pictorial art,[1] which was opened in 1994 and named after him [1] He had a studio in Kamakura, Kanagawa. There is a museum dedicated to the artist in Setoda which also has an English Web site at [2]. Ikuo Hiryama actively collecte material relating to the historical silk road. His collections included Chinese and Gandhara sculpture, Sasanian and Central Asian silver ware, toilet trays and coins, in total at least 222 pieces. His collection is particularly notable for its collection of Gandharan art from Pakistan and Afghanistan.[2] His collection of Central Asian coins was small contain only 101 items, though these included one of the best preserved of Kanishka I's Buddha coins as well as other important examples [3]
