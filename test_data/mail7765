AOLpress was an HTML editor available from AOL. It was originally developed as NaviPress by the company NaviSoft before being bought by AOL. It was discontinued in 2000. However, the last version (2.0) can still be found on some websites. The HTML code used is very outdated and may not display more recent websites. It does not support PNG, and this limits its support on many websites where the new PNG format has been adopted. It actively pushed AOL's PrimeHost service. In February 1994 Navipress released a web browser with an integrated HTML editor, which was very similar to the first web browser WorldWideWeb,[1] for Mac OS and Microsoft Windows.[2]
