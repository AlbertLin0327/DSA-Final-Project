Vision Rx Lab is an organic and mineral ophthalmic lens manufacturer. Headquartered in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata, it has 14 laboratories and 16 service centres across India. [1] Vision Rx Lab is a group company of the French ophthalmic firm Essilor. The company formed from the joint-venture of ophthalmic firms Essilor and GKB Rx Lens Pvt Ltd in 2006.  The company began its journey as GKB Rx Lens Pvt. Ltd. in the northern Indian city of Agra way back in 1959. The principal activities were shifted to Kolkata in 1969 where the first surfacing lab was set. GKB partnered with European ophthalmic firms for technology, equipments, raw materials and consumables. A joint venture was formed between GKB and ESSILOR in 2006 and Vision Rx Lab came into existence.[2] [3] [4] Vision Rx created 100% back-surface design. Digital surfacing is a major technological advance used in the production of ophthalmic lenses. Most new progressive lenses are machined using this technique. Also known as Free form lens technology, it is not that new but bringing it to the market on an individual lens prescription basis is relatively new. Progressive lens manufacturers have used free form technology for years to design and manufacture the molds that progressive lens blanks are then cast from. Then these lens blanks are ground and polished into the finished prescription. Each process has margin for error so in theory cutting down the number of processes makes for a more accurate prescription. Advances in computer technology have made it possible to do this. Polycarbonate was developed in the 1970s for aerospace applications, and is used for the helmet visors of astronauts and for space shuttle windshields. Eyeglass lenses made of polycarbonate were introduced in the early 1980s in response to a demand for lightweight, impact-resistant lenses. Since then, polycarbonate lenses have become the standard for safety glasses, sports goggles and children's eyewear. Because they are less likely to fracture than regular plastic lenses, polycarbonate lenses also are a good choice for rimless eyewear designs where the lenses are attached to the frame components with drill mountings. Despite its many advantages, polycarbonate isn't the only lens material suitable for safety applications and children's eyewear.In 2001, PPG Industries (Pittsburgh, Penn.) introduced a rival lens material called Trivex. Like polycarbonate lenses, lenses made of Trivex are thin, lightweight and much more impact-resistant than regular plastic or glass lenses.Trivex lenses, however, are composed of a urethane-based monomer and are made from a cast molding process similar to how regular plastic lenses are made. This gives Trivex lenses the advantage of crisper optics than injection-molded polycarbonate lenses, according to PPG.
