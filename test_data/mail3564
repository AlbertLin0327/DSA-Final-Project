Jorge Lus dos Santos Dias, known as Jorge Lus (born 11 February 1976), is a Brazilian retired footballer who played as a left defender. Born in Nova Iguau, Rio de Janeiro, Jorge Lus started his career at local Fluminense Football Club, playing with the team through consecutive relegations to the Srie B and Srie C. In 2001, he left for Santa Cruz Futebol Clube in the Srie A, in a relegation-ending season. In August 2002, Lus left for Portugal and signed for Varzim SC,[1] suffering yet another relegation. The following year, he stayed in the north of the country, joining fellow Primeira Liga outfit Sporting de Braga.[2] During his 2 season-spell in Minho, Jorge Lus was a regular starter, as the team achieved two fifth positions and one fourth, with the subsequent UEFA Cup qualifications. In January 2006, he moved to FC Dynamo Moscow in Russia for 3 million and Nuno Frechaut,[3] as the club signed several Portuguese or Portugal-based players in that timeframe (Danny, Derlei, Maniche, etc). After just six Premier League games, however, he returned to his previous club, on loan.[4] In July 2007, Lus returned to his country and joined for Sport Club Internacional, signing a one-year contract.[5] In May of the following year, he moved to Porto Alegre Futebol Clube in the Rio Grande do Sul State League (second division); in August he moved teams again, signing with Clube de Regatas Brasil, and leaving after only one second level game played.[6] In late October 2009, after one year without a club, 33-year old Lus returned to Portugal and joined C.D. Trofense in the Liga de Honra.[7] He retired at the end of the season, aged 34.
