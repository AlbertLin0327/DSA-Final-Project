Song Hui-gyeong (13761446) was a scholar-official of the Joseon Dynasty Korea in 15th century. He was also diplomat and ambassador, representing Joseon interests in the Hoeryesa (diplomatic mission) to the Ashikaga shogunate in Japan.[1] King Sejong dispatched a diplomatic mission to Japan in 1419-1420. This embassy to court of Ashikaga Yoshimasa in Kamakura was led by Song Hui-gyeong . Its purpose was to respond to a message sent to the Joseon court by the Japanese shogun.[2] The Japanese hosts may have construed this mission as tending to confirm a Japanocentric world order.[3] Song Hui-gyeong's actions were more narrowly focused in negotiating protocols for Joseon-Japan diplomatic relations.[2]
