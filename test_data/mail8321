Don't speak German? Click here to read a machine-translated version of the German article. Renitenztheater is a theatre in Baden-Wrttemberg, Germany. Most of the events consist in guest appearances by comedians and singers. In addition, each year it features a satirical play produced by the theater itself. One of the annual highlights of the theater is the "German-Turkish cabaret week." Coordinates: 484622N 91032E / 48.77278N 9.17556E / 48.77278; 9.17556
