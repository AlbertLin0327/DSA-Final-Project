The Vilcabamba Tapaculo (Scytalopus urubambae) is a small passerine bird endemic to Peru. This tapaculo was formerly considered to be a subspecies of Magellanic Tapaculo, Scytalopus magellanicus, but is now treated as a separate species based on differences in voice. It is a wren-like bird with a slender bill and fairly long legs. The tail is short and held erect. It is terrestrial and prefers to run rather than fly. It inhabits dense vegetation near ground-level in forest and woodland where it forages for insects. The domed nest is made of moss, lichens and root-fibres.
