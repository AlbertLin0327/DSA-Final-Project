The Spin Wheel is a British drill manoeuvre. The manoeuvre is not written down,[1] but is instead passed down from one generation to the next. The manoeuvre is performed at the Trooping of the Colour by The Massed Bands, Corps of Drums, and Pipes and Drums of Her Majesty's Guards Division, and was designed after the addition of the then newly formed Regimental Bands of the Welsh and Irish Guards to the parade. With over 400 men, it became impossible to turn the formation in the standard manner using a 'wheel'. As such, the Spin Wheel was required. The manoeuvre itself is extremely complex, and is coordinated by five Directors of Music within the ranks, as well as several non-commissioned officers. It results in the entire formation pivoting on its centre, then continuing the ceremony.
