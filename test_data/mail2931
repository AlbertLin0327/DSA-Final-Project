Kiss 102.7 was established in Carrollton, Georgia, in July 1994.[1] Known by the simple callsign WCKS, the station was forced to use WCKS-FM from 2004 through 2006 when AM radio station WNSI was acquired by the Gradick family and its callsign changed to WCKS. On November 29, 1996, the AM station became WCKA[2] so on December 12, 2006, this FM station was able to resume its WCKS identification.[3] (Top 40) KHFI-FM (Austin, Texas)  KHKS (Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas)  KIIS-FM (Los Angeles, California)  KUUL (Davenport, Iowa/Quad Cities)  KKDM (Des Moines, Iowa)  KSFT-FM (Sioux City, Iowa)  KSME (Fort Collins, Colorado)  KZZP (Phoenix, Arizona)  WAEV (Savannah, Georgia)  WAKS (Akron-Cleveland, Ohio)  WFKS (Melbourne, Florida)  WHKF (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania)  WKFS-FM (Cincinnati, Ohio)  WKKF (Albany, New York)  WKSB (Williamsport, Pennsylvania)  WKSC-FM (Chicago, Illinois)  WKSI-FM (Winchester, Virginia)  WKST-FM (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)  WVKF (Wheeling, WV/Steubenville, OH)  WVKS (Toledo, Ohio)  WXKS-FM (Boston, Massachusetts)  WKSS (Hartford, Connecticut)  KVVS (Lancaster/Antelope Valley, California)  KBKS-FM (Seattle, Washington) (Rhythmic Contemporary) KISS-XM United States (SDARS)  KKMY (Beaumont, Texas)  WAKZ (Youngstown, Ohio)  WPKF (Poughkeepsie, New York)  WKGS (Rochester, New York) (Rhythmic AC) WKSL (Raleigh, North Carolina) (AC) KISC (Spokane, Washington) (Urban)KISQ (San Francisco, California)  WKSP (Augusta, Georgia )  WMRZ (Albany, Georgia)
