Public Knowledge is a non-profit Washington, D.C.-based public interest group that is involved in intellectual property law, competition, and choice in the digital marketplace, and an open standards/end-to-end internet. Its co-founders are David Bollier and Gigi Sohn (current president), while Peter Suber is director of its open access project, and its directors include MIT professor Hal Abelson, Stanford Law professor Lawrence Lessig, and former FCC chairman Reed Hundt.[1] Public Knowledge's work focuses on the three 'IP's of communications and copyright policy: information policy, intellectual property, and Internet Protocol. While Public Knowledge has taken part in many information policy debates, the group is particularly well-known for its steady advocacy against the expansion of copyright and for the importance of copyright defenses and exemptions such as fair use. For instance, in response to the FCC's attempt to mandate a broadcast flag for all digital TV tuners, Public Knowledge led the successful legal campaign to have the rule overturned.[2] [3] [4] One study of the politics of digital rights management policy concluded, "Since its 2001 founding, Public Knowledge has risen to prominence as the pre-eminent DC-based policy advocacy organization within the strong fair use coalition."[5]
