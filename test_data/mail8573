Don't speak Italian? Click here to read a machine-translated version of the Italian article. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Menongue (Latin: Dioecesis Menonguensis) is a diocese located in the city of Menongue in the Ecclesiastical province of Lubango in Angola. The Cathedral of the diocese is S Catedral de Nossa Senhora de Ftima (Cathedral Church of Our Lady of Fatima) in Menongue.
