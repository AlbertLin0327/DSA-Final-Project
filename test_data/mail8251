Kirrawee High School is a comprehensive co-educational high school located in Kirrawee, New South Wales adjacent to the Royal National Park. The school was opened in 1966[1] and now caters for around 1200 students, most continuing their education from three local primary schools, Gymea Bay, Grays Point and Kirrawee. The school is a Languages High School which also offers a comprehensive education in sports and in the performing arts, with musician James Morrison a close mentor for the school's band. The school has had consistently high academic results with 2010 HSC results placing it 56th in the state, and in the Sutherland Cronulla Education District, Kirrawee High school was second only to the academic selective high school Caringbah High, which placed 17th.[2] Real estate agents selling local properties often feature 'Kirrawee High Catchment' as a positive property attribute because the school is seen as desirable; each year many out-of-area students compete for limited places at the school with students accepted for outstanding ability in academic, sports, musical or artistic fields. Extra-curricular activities offered include debating and public speaking, musical and dramatic productions, the Student Council, community service, charitable collections and fund raising and many sports programs.[3]
