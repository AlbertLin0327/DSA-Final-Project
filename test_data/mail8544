The Calumet is a historic commercial building located at Buffalo in Erie County, New York. It was designed in 1906, and is a three-story steel frame building covered in decorative architectural terra cotta. The distinctive glazed white and burnt sienna terra cotta is detailed with a centrally located reed or running stem and four leaves depicting the Calamus palm.[2] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.[1]
