Coordinates: 540256N 24806W / 54.048858N 2.801739W / 54.048858; -2.801739 Lancaster City Museum is a museum in Lancaster, Lancashire, England. It is housed in the former town hall in the Market Square and includes the museum of the King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster).[1] The museum was founded in 1923, and its collections illustrate the archaeology and history of the city and surrounding areas.[2] Among its highlights is the Lancaster Roman Tombstone, a memorial dating from c. 100 AD which was found locally in 2005. It depicts a Roman soldier on horseback with a decapitated opponent at his feet, and is described as "an iconic piece of Lancaster's dramatic past [giving] a crucial insight into the history of the county."[3] The museum has expressed an interest in acquiring the Viking-era Silverdale Hoard, discovered in the City of Lancaster district in 2011, for its collection.[4] The Museums, Libraries and Archives Council granted the museum "Accredited" status;[5] since 1 October 2011 accreditation is a responsibility of Arts Council England.[6] The Old Town Hall building in which the museum is housed is a grade II* listed building. It was designed by Major Thomas Jarrett and built between 1781-83, with a cupola added in 1782 to a design by Thomas Harrison. It was extended in 1871 and 1886. In 1910, the functions of the Town Hall were transferred to a new building in nearby Dalton Square. The old Town Hall was converted into a museum in 1923.[7] The building is a two-storey structure built from sandstone ashlar, fronted by a projecting tetrastyle Tuscan portico. The faade presents five bays with round-arched windows and, in the centre under the portico, a round-arched door at the top of a set of four steps. The cupola surmounting the building has a square base with a second octagonal stage on the side of which is a clock face. Above is a round drum surrounded by a rotunda of Ionic columns, capped by a dome. The ground floor was originally open and contained an arcade housing a market for grain and butter. The openings to the arcade were later filled with the current ground-floor windows. The building has served a number of purposes over the years; as well as housing Lancaster's Council Chamber and subsequently the City Museum, it also housed the town court (complete with lock-ups) and branches of Barclays Bank (until 1969) and the National Westminster Bank (until 1977).[7]
