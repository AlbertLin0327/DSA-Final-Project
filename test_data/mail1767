State Route 86 marker Virginia Routes Interstate U.S. Primary Secondary History Turnpikes Virginia State Route 86 (SR 86) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. The state highway runs 3.33 miles (5.36km) from the North Carolina state line, where the highway continues as North Carolina Highway 86 (NC 86), north to U.S. Route 29 Business (US 29 Business) and SR 413 within Danville. SR 86 begins at the North Carolina state line, which also serves as the southern limit of the independent city of Danville. The road continues south as NC 86 toward Yanceyville and Chapel Hill. SR 86 heads north as South Main Street, which expands from two lanes to a four-lane divided highway just north of the border and has a diamond interchange with the Danville Expressway, which carries US 29 and US 58 around the south side of the city. North of College Park Drive, the state highway becomes a five-lane road with center turn lane and passes Danville Community College. At its crossing of Norfolk Southern Railway's Danville District, SR 86 expands to a divided highway and its name changes to Central Boulevard. The state highway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 293 (West Main Street) next to Danville Regional Medical Center before reaching its northern terminus at a cloverleaf interchange with US 29 Business and SR 413 just south of the Dan River. Memorial Drive heads west as US 29 Business toward Greensboro and east as SR 413 toward downtown Danville. Central Boulevard continues straight across the river as US 29 Business toward Lynchburg.[1][2] The entire route is in the independent city of Danville.
