Gary Mabbutt MBE (born 23 August 1961 in Bristol) is an English former professional footballer who made more than 600 appearances in the Football League and Premier League playing for Bristol Rovers and Tottenham Hotspur, and won 16 caps for the England national team.[1][2] He was most regularly seen in central defence but was a versatile player who excelled also in midfield. His father is Ray Mabbutt and brother Kevin Mabbutt. He is best remembered for his 16-year spell at Tottenham Hotspur, where he played from 1982 until 1998. He became one of the best known defenders in English football in the 1980s, playing initially for Bristol Rovers before joining the first division club Tottenham Hotspur, where he became captain and won 16 caps for England, scoring against Yugoslavia in 1986. With Spurs, he won the UEFA Cup in 1984 and the FA Cup in 1991 (as captain). In the 1987 FA Cup Final against Coventry City, Mabbutt had an eventful game where he scored Spurs' second goal to put them 2-1 up but, after Coventry had equalised to force extra time, he scored an own goal to give Coventry a 3-2 win. He suffered a broken leg on the opening day of the 1996-97 season and did not return until the following campaign, at the end of which he retired from playing after 16 years at White Hart Lane. By this stage, he was the club's longest-serving player. His final appearance for the club came against Southampton on the last day of the 1997-98 season.[3] During the early 1990s, Mabbutt dated actress Sophie Lawrence, most famed for her role as Diane Butcher in EastEnders, for two years.[4] Mabbutt has type 1 diabetes, and became an icon for many children with the condition. He famously appeared on the BBC's children's television programme Blue Peter where he demonstrated injecting insulin into an orange to show how he dealt with his condition on a daily basis.[5] Another CBBC appearance came in the drama series The Queen's Nose, an adaptation of the book by Dick King-Smith. Mabbutt appeared in a cameo as himself, appearing in the nick of time to help save a children's football team from defeat. He is currently[when?] serving as an ambassador for the 2010 World Cup Finals in South Africa. He is also working with the Deloitte Street Child World Cup, training and encouraging street children and ex-street children in football and for street children's rights in Durban, South Africa. This is run by the Amos Trust. Tottenham Hotspur
