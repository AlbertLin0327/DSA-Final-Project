Iconium is an unincorporated community in St. Clair County, Missouri,[1] with a population of 35 people. The town is perhaps best known for "Scott's Iconium Store," a local institution that is a frequent pilgrimage destination for Boy Scouts, many of whom refer to the town as "Ico" for short, and is well-known for its Peach Nehi floats.[2] The town is also very close to the H. Roe Bartle Scout Reservation. Coordinates: 380621N 933240W / 38.10583N 93.54444W / 38.10583; -93.54444
