The FIBA Europe Player of the Year Award is an annual official FIBA Europe award inaugurated in the year 2005, with awards given for both men and women. The winner is a basketball player that has European citizenship and whose performances with his or her sports club and/or national team throughout the year have reached the highest level of excellence. All European players, regardless of where they play in the world, qualify for the award, including NBA and WNBA players. Players do not have to play in any FIBA competitions at all in order to qualify. The winner receives the prize after winning a vote of the both fans and a panel of basketball experts, media members, and coaches from 25 different countries. Consequently, the legitimacy of the men's award is somewhat higher than the Superbasket magazine's Mister Europa Award and the Gazzetta dello Sport's Euroscar Award, which do not include the fan vote. That being specified, the importance of those two awards rely on their tradition, as their inception occurred in the years 1976 and 1979 respectively. All in all, the laureates are the same on all three lists in the great majority of cases, all of them representing the biggest European basketball stars since the mid 1970s. If a winner played for more than one club team in the calendar year of his or her award, all teams are listed in chronological order. Note that women often play in the WNBA during the European off season.
