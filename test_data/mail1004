Nokia Music Store India is the Indian branch of Nokia Music Store which sell music online. According to Nokia Executive Vice President Anssi Vanjoki, With more than 300 million music enabled devices sold, and a strong base of over 10 Nokia Music stores in operation globally, Nokia has been able to gain incredible amount of knowledge and insights on what people want in a music device and track important trends on how people consume music.[1] The Nokia Music Store India was formally launched today at the Music Connects conference. More than 3 million tracks are available and, as with Nokia Music Stores in other countries, there is a heavy emphasis on including local music. Nokia has signed up India's major independent labels including Tseries, Yashraj Music, Saregama, BIG Music and Venus; it has also partnered with India's leading music body, the Indian Music Industry. Nokia also announced that its Comes with Music service would be arriving in India later this year.[2] The Nokia Music Store is a service where you can browse and buy music in order to download on your PC and compatible Nokia mobile device. Music downloaded from Nokia Music Store can be conveniently moved between your PC and compatible Nokia device, as well as copied to CD and moved on to compatible digital music players. Nokia Music Store also offers a monthly subscription service that allows you to stream unlimited music from the Store catalogue direct to your internet-connected PC. The Nokia Music Store is available in the United Kingdom, Germany, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Singapore, Australia, France, Sweden, Spain and Netherlands and will expand to more countries throughout the year. The standard Nokia Music Store features are available for the Indian store, including the on-device mobile client for over-the-air downloads and PC client (Nokia Music) for downloads to the PC. Purchased tracks may be played back on the phone or via the PC and can be synced between the two, regardless of how they were downloaded. The Nokia Music Store was previously available in 'soft launch' mode, with track purchase only available via vouchers. Vouchers were (and will be) available in the sales box of selected handsets (Nseries, Eseries and XpressMusic). The Nokia X6 was the first handset, from the X series, to be shipped with Ovi Music Unlimited vouchers. The vouchers are valid for 1 year during which the user may download any number of songs. The tracks have a bitrate of 128 kbit/s and contains DRM which only allows the playback of the file on the phone or the registered PC. For promoting 'Ovi Music Unlimited', Nokia released an advertisement referring to the offer as, 'Become a Music Milloinaire'[3]
