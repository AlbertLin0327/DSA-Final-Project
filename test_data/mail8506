Del Oro High School is located in Loomis, California, and is a part of the Placer Union High School District. 50 Years ago (1959), Del Oro High School opened for instruction of freshmen and sophomores on Sept. 28, one week after Placer in Auburn and Colfax opened. It was founded in 1958 and currently has over 1600 students attending with its largest freshmen class in school history (over 500 freshmen students in 2009).[citation needed] The dropout rate is less than 1%,[1] which is below the California state average. Many of Del Oro's teachers are return students. The school has a decades long rivalry with neighboring Placer High School in Auburn, CA, as well as a more recent rivalry with Granite Bay High School. Del Oro's Division II ranked athletes compete in football, basketball, tennis, baseball, cross country, water polo, track, soccer, and wrestling. Del Oro's performing arts hold a strong role in the small Loomis community. The performing arts department at Del Oro currently consist of an instrumental program, choral program, theatrical program, and dance program. The oldest and most rooted in Del Oro tradition is the "band program", currently directed by Ben Duncan. The program consists of five ensembles: marching band (fall only), concert band (spring only), jazz band (spring only), winter percussion (spring only), and winter guard (spring only). None of the ensembles run year-round (which is a relief for everyone) so it is very common that students participate in marching band in the fall and up to three of the other choices in the spring (in rare cases, a student may be able to participate in all ensembles). The band program holds long standing traditions in the Loomis community as the host of the Del Oro Golden Eagle Spectacular (an annual marching band competition for schools in Northern California and sometimes neighboring states) and more recently its hosting of the Del Oro Golden Eagle Winter Spectacular (an annual competition for winter percussion and winter guard ensembles). The band program also hosts an annual local crab feed and performs an annual "light show" at the homecoming game where the stadium lights are turned off and the students perform wearing lights on their bodies with the marching percussion lighting up on contact. Del Oro has two choral ensembles: beginning choir and advanced choir. Both are directed by Lisa Sands (preceded by Marlene Astle). Del Oro is known within the state-wide choir community for producing significant numbers of honor choir participants both on the regional and state levels. Though relatively new (the full program began in 2005), the theatre department has quickly become a staple in the Loomis community. The program's debut production was the American classic, "You Can't Take it With You", written by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart and directed by Jeffrey Johnson, co-founder of Del Oro's theatrical program. It opened in late-2004, prior to the completion of the new theatre facility and was performed on the campus cafeteria stage. The school received 10 Elly Award nominations, with one win, from the Sacramento Area Regional Theatre Alliance for the performances of "The Foreigner" and "Noises Off" during the 2006-2007 school year. The newest program started and was founded by a student named LaTasha Holland in 2006, and is directed by Dawn Kenniston who soon took over in 2007. The "Del Oro Fight Song" is an adaptation of the Washington State University Fight Song; in fact, the marching band plays exactly the same sheet music. The difference between the two fight songs are the lyrics. Fight, fight, fight for Del Oro High! Win our victory! Black and gold will always be bold. Best in the golden west, we'll do our level best! Golden Eagles never give in; Honor and loyalty will win! So fight, fight, fight for Del Oro High and victory! OLDER VERSION (Early years) Fight, fight, fight for Del Oro High! Win THE victory! Black and gold will always be bold. Best in the Golden West, we'll do our level best! Golden Eagles never give in; Honor and GLORY WE will win! So fight, fight, fight for Del Oro High and victory!
