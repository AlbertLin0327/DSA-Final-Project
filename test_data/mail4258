Cathie Taylor was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba on 7/26/1944. As a child Taylor had moved with her family from Canada to Morgan Hill, California. At age 12, a talent contest appearance led to her singing western folk songs on San Franciscos KQED-TV. After some time raising blue-ribbon cows, she landed her own radio show on KPER, Gilroy,CA. Word of her talent spread to Country & Western impresario Cliffie Stone, who invited her to Los Angeles, and guided her early career. Taylor went on to appear on The Breakfast Club, The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show (2/19/59), The Lawrence Welk Show and The Roy Rogers & Dale Evans Show (1962), as well as starring as a singer in Alfred Hitchcocks Presents, Run For Doom (5/17/63). She appeared in the 1963 film Hootenanny Hoot (which also featured Johnny Cash, George Hamilton IV, Judy Henske and many others), sang on Shindig! (9/1/65), and won awards from the Academy of Country Music in 1966 (Most Promising Female Vocalist) and 1968 (Best Female Vocalist). In the 70s she turned to gospel music, singing on the 700 Club on the Christian Broadcasting Network cable network. In 2010 Taylor was still performing church concerts and released a new CD called Praising My Savior.
