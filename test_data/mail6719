Ansar Mwananteba (Owner) Hewa Bora Airways Sarl (operating as Hewa Bora Airways) was the national airline of the Democratic Republic of the Congo based in Barumbu, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo.[1][2] It was one of Congo's largest airlines and operates regional and domestic services. Its main base was N'djili Airport.[3] "Hewa Bora" is Swahili for "Fresh Air". Hewa Bora Airways had 1,100 employees in March 2007.[3] The airline was established and started operations in 1994 with the joining together of Zaire Airlines, Zaire Express and Congo Airlines. On 1 November 2007, HBA (51%) and Brussels Airlines subsidiary Pan African Airlines (49%) announced a new domestic partnership to be called AirDC, to operate BAe 146-200 and Boeing 737 aircraft, principally to Lubumbashi, Mbuji-Mayi, Brazzaville and Douala.[4] This project was cancelled because of disagreements between Brussels Airlines and Hewa Bora. On 15 December 2009, Brussels Airlines announced they are working on a new airline in Congo. The working name of the project is Korongo, it will be launched without Hewa Bora and start operations somewhere in 2010. On the 24 June 2009, the new website of Hewa Bora Airways went online, after not having been updated since 2005. On 16 July 2011, the airline's Air Operator's Certificate was suspended, following the accident that befell Flight 952 on 8 July 2011.[5] The entire Hewa Bora Airways fleet was blacklisted in European airspace. The Lockheed L-1011-500 and the Boeing 767-200ER were the last planes accepted in Europe before new noise regulations and storage of the 767 definitively banned the airline. Hewa Bora Airways was the last airline that was allowed to operate from the Democratic Republic of the Congo into Europe. In March 2012, FlyCongo launched operations with the remains of Hewa Bora. It uses the airlines previous Boeing 767 and McDonnell Douglas MD-82 aircraft. It also announced it would be destroying six aircraft left behind by Hewa Bora to reduce safety concerns.[6] After a dispute with Brussels Airlines, Hewa Bora Airways decided to rescind the codeshare agreement between the two airlines and start their own flights to Brussels. However, as Hewa Bora was banned from the European Union, they had to wet-lease a RAK Airways Boeing 757-200 to operate the flights. For a short time, the airline flew twice weekly Kinshasa-Brussels-Paris-Brussels-Kinshasa. Such flights were discontinued due to the EU's total ban of Hewa Bora operations. It then became impossible for Hewa Bora to fly to the EU. The Hewa Bora Airways fleet included the following aircraft when it suspended operations:[7] Hewa Bora Airways also operated the following aircraft prior to ceasing operations:
