Conraua robusta the Giant Slippery frog is a species of frog in the Ranidae family. It is found in Cameroon and Nigeria. This species is a direct member of the great Goliath frog,the largest known frog species in the world , the Goliath frog and the other species in the Conraua genus are extreme developed frog,living in colder,fast moving rivercurrents and streams . These frogs are very muscular ,have very well developed large upperlegmuscles , have superb jumping and swimming capabilities and can overpower rather large prey . if needed. The Slippery giant frog,is smaller than the giant Goliath who can become 25 - 32 cm in Snout to vent length at least,larger animals have been reported,the Slippery giant is still a large species capable of killing mice,rats or comparable vertebrates or larger insects . Very less is known of this species,and therefore the lifestyle,habitats and ecology is still rather secretive . Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, rivers, and heavily degraded former forest. It is threatened by habitat loss. Some of the native tribes ,and fisheries hunt these large frogs for their meat,these frogs have immense thighs,can weigh as much as a chicken or more . The IUCN and local wildrangers are developing more understanding to the locals to conserve these great frogs,because theyre very important for the Ecosystem structure .
