Ma'alefa'ak is the name of a DC Comics supervillain. Regarded as the archenemy of the Martian Manhunter, he is responsible for the near-extinction of the Green Martian species. Ma'alefa'ak is the twin brother and archenemy of J'onn J'onnz, known to Humans as the Martian Manhunter. Ma'alefa'ak was led to believe he was the only member of the Martian race born without telepathy and a weakness to fire. In truth, he had partaken in the mind-rape of J'onn's wife, M'yri'ah, and when caught, the Council of Mars performed a rare act to strip Ma'alefa'ak of his telepathy and his very identity as punishment. Feeling ostracized because of his perceived genetic differences, Ma'alefa'ak was the architect of an extinction-level event. This event is known as Hronmeers Curse. Hronmeers Curse was a plague of fire, this curse attacked Martians via their telepathic abilities. Whenever a Martian attempted to use their telepathic gifts or commune with the Great Mind, they would fall victim to the Curse, and ultimately burn to death. With the exception of Ma'alefa'ak's brother, J'onn and himself, nearly all Green Martians on the planet died as a result of Ma'alefa'ak's handiwork. For centuries, Ma'alefa'ak continued to live in the ruins of Mars, unaware that his brother had survived the plague, and had been transported through space and time to the planet Earth. Several years ago, Ma'alefa'ak learned of J'onn's existence, and followed him back to Earth in an effort to complete the genocide of the Martian race, by destroying its last surviving son.[1] Ma'alefa'ak later ambushed the Martian Manhunter and assumed his identity in order to infiltrate the Justice League and began his plans to take over Earth. The real Martian Manhunter managed to recover and helped the Justice League defeat Ma'alefa'ak. When the Manhunter re-opened Ma'alefa'ak's telepathy during a fire, Superman and Orion used a Boom Tube to save Orion while Ma'alefa'ak is consumed by the fires. It is assumed that Ma'alefa'ak is deceased.[2] Like all Martians, Ma'alefa'ak possesses shapeshifting abilities. He also has super-strength, heat vision, and invisibility. He doesn't have telepathy and doesn't have a fear of fire.
