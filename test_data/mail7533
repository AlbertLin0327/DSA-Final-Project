Comet 30P/Reinmuth, also known as Comet Reinmuth 1, is a periodic comet in the solar system, first discovered by Karl Reinmuth (Landessternwarte Heidelberg-Knigstuhl, Germany) on February 22, 1928. First calculations of orbit concluded a period of 25 years, but this was revised down to 7 years and speculation this was the same comet as Comet Taylor, which had been lost since 1915. Further calculations by George van Biesbroeck concluded they were different comets. The 1935 approach was observed though not as favourable, in 1937 the comet passed close to Jupiter which increased the perihelion distance and orbital period. Due to miscalculations, the 1942 appearance was missed, but it has been observed on every subsequent appearance since. The comet nucleus is estimated to be 7.8 kilometers in diameter.[4]
