Giorgos Konstadinou (Greek:  ; born October 27, 1934 in Athens) is a popular Greek actor, writer, and director.[1] His career was boosted after the 'profiterole' scene in the movie Ktipokardia sto thranio and reached its pinnacle with the comedy film The... Kopanoi in the 1980s. However after that era, tired and unable to express any innovative skills, he resorted in acting and writing an ample number of theater plays and TV shows widely considered flops. Still, he exhibits true strength and tenacity by surviving in the TV and theater scene for all these years.
