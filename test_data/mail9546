The cutting was constructed between 1963 and 1964 for the Eastern Railway route through the Avon Valley. The route became operational in February 1966.[1] A lookout and picnic area were developed at the site giving tourists a view from the top of the cutting. A plaque at the lookout reads: Windmill Hill Cutting Deepest cutting on the standard gauge railway and one of the deepest in Australia.
