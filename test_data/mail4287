Content:
The following is a glossary of terms used in card games. Besides the terms listed here, there are thousands of common and uncommon slang terms. This is not intended to be a formal dictionary; precise usage details and multiple closely related senses are omitted here in favor of concise treatment of the basics. A few games have enough of their own specific terminology to warrant their own glossaries: Terms in this glossary (unlike those above) should apply to a wide range of card games.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
