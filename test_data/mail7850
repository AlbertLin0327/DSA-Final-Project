Morten Lindberg (born September 23, 1965), also known as "Master Fatman," is a well known Danish media personality, comedian, disc jockey, film director and singer. As a musician Lindberg has participated in numerous projects and bands, sometimes as an instrumentalist and sometimes as a singer. Projects and bands that he has been or is a part of include: Master Fatman and his Freedom Fighters, Master Fatman Guru Orchestra, Lindberg Hemmer Foundation, Nature TM and Per Kristensen Band. Most of the bands that Lindberg has been involved with have only been modestly successful, and the style of music that he has worked with has most frequently been easy listening. In 1992, Lindberg made his debut as a film director with the cult movie Gayniggers from Outer Space.[1] In 2006 Master Fatman competed in the 3rd season of the popular contest Vild Med Dans (Danish version of Dancing with the Stars) on TV2.[2]
