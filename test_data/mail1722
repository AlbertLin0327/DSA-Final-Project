Foster was a railway station on the South Gippsland line in South Gippsland, Victoria. The station was opened during the 1890s operated until 1991 when the line to Barry Beach servicing the oil fields in Bass Strait was closed. The line was dismantled and turned into the Great Southern Rail Trail. Foster contained a large goods yard, and the platform is still in good condition. The last Steamrail special to Foster ran in 1988, with the D3639 and K153 with a long train. Coordinates: 383931S 1461225E / 38.6587S 146.2070E / -38.6587; 146.2070
