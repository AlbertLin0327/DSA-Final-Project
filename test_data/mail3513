The Halle Opera House (German: Opernhaus Halle) is an opera house in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt. Originally named the Halle Town Theatre (German: Stadttheater von Halle), the theatre was built in 1886. A bomb attack on 31 March 1945 destroyed much of the original building. Restorative work ensued a few years later, and the theatre reopened in 1951 under the name Landestheater Halle. In January 1992 it was renamed to its current title. The theatre is currently used for performances of opera, ballet, plays, and orchestral concerts. It is also the main performance venue for the annual summer Handel Festival held in the city. Coordinates: 512912N 115817E / 51.48667N 11.97139E / 51.48667; 11.97139
