The special election resulted from the resignation of Representative Asbury Francis Lever on August 1, 1919. Edward C. Mann won the Democratic primary and was unopposed in the general election. The South Carolina Democratic Party held their primary in the summer of 1919 and six candidates entered the race. George Bell Timmerman emerged atop the first primary election on August 26, but was defeated in the runoff election by Edward C. Mann on September 9. There was no opposition to the Democratic candidate in the general election so Mann was elected to serve out the remainder of the term.
