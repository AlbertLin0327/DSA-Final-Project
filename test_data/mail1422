The Bayer designation Beta Sagittarii ( Sgr,  Sagittarii) is shared by two star systems,  Sagittarii and  Sagittarii, in the constellation Sagittarius. The two stars are separated by 0.36 in the sky. Beta Sagittarii also has the traditional name Arkab, from the Arabic  carqb meaning hamstring. Beta-1 Sagittarii, also called Arkab Prior since it leads  across the sky, is a binary star lying 378 light years from Earth. Arkab Prior A is a spectral type B9 main sequence dwarf which has an apparent magnitude of +3.96. Arkab Prior B is a type A3 dwarf with an apparent magnitude of +7.4. The two stars are separated in the sky by 28 arcseconds, which puts them at least 3300 astronomical units apart. Beta-2 Sagittarii, also called Arkab Posterior since it trails  across the sky, is a spectral type F2 giant which has an apparent magnitude of +4.27. It is 137 light years from Earth. USS Arkab (AK-130) was a United States Navy Crater class cargo ship named after the star.
