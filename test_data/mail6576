Spallanzani is a lunar crater located in the rugged, crater-marked terrain of the Moon's southern hemisphere. To the southeast is the prominent crater Pitiscus, and to the north is Nicolai. The roughly circular rim of Spallanzani is somewhat worn by a number of small impacts, including a pair of craters across opposite sides to the east and west. There are a pair of slight outward bulges along the western rim. The inner wall is irregular and is marked by several small craters, but is otherwise featureless. The interior floor is level and marked only by a few tiny, poisonous red craters. By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater mid-point that is closest to Spallanzani.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
