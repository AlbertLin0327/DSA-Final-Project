Shazna (stylized as SHAZNA) was a Japanese visual kei rock band originally active from 1993 to 2000. The band started on the relatively harder side of rock, but upon signing to a major label switched to a softer pop sound mixed with new wave. They became one of the most popular visual kei bands of the 1990s, together with Malice Mizer, La'cryma Christi and Fanatic Crisis. In 2006 Shazna reunited, they disbanded once again in 2009. Formed in 1993 with Izam on vocals, Aoi (originally written AOI) on guitar, Kiy on bass and Katsura on drums. Katsura left in 1996 and joined Baiser, leaving the trio.[1] Perhaps the band's most notable feature was vocalist Izam and his choice of fashion; taking the cross-dressing feminine look to an extreme. Izam was largely influenced by Boy George and Culture Club, whom he later did a cover album of in 1998.[1][2] With the release of their major debut single "Melty Love" on August 27, 1997, Shazna gained immense popularity and many awards.[1] It reached number two on the Oricon chart, earned them the "Best Newcomer" award from the Nippon Yusen Awards and helped their album Gold Sun and Silver Moon, which was named "Rock Album of the Year" by Japan Gold Disc Awards, be certified Million by the RIAJ.[3][4] In 1999, Izam married famous idol Hinano Yoshikawa, only to file for separation two months later and divorce two months after that.[1] Both the marriage and divorce caused a scandal. In October they released a cover of Ippu-Do's "Violet September Love" as a single.[1] In 1999 Shazna signed to Toshiba EMI and released the album Pure Hearts in June. Their last single (and their second Christmas single) "Winter's Review" was released in December. In January 2000, a singles collection was released, however in October Shazna went on an activity pause. The members all went in different musical directions. Izam, with a much less feminine look, became a solo singer and turned to acting, appearing in several films such as Chinese Dinner, G@me and Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon: Act Zero, a special episode of the live-action series based on the popular Sailor Moon manga. Back in 1998 Izam also had a cameo appearance in the Crayon Shin-chan movie Crayon Shin-chan: Blitzkrieg! Pig's Hoof's Secret Mission, which used Shazna's song "Pureness" as its theme song. Aoi performs as an acoustic guitarist and singer, and became a filmmaker. Niy performs with the band Fanble. In June 2006, after 6 years Shazna announced that they were reuniting. They held their first concert on September 5, 2006 and released the single "Heart" on April 25. They released the album 10th Melty Life on August 8, 2007, 10 years after the release of their major single debut "Melty Love".[1] On November 3, 2008, Shazna announced that they would disband and played their last concert on March 22, 2009 at Shibuya O-East.[1][5] Shazna's song "Melty Love" was covered by BugLug on the compilation Crush! -90's V-Rock Best Hit Cover Songs-. The album was released on January 26, 2011 and features current visual kei bands covering songs from bands that were important to the '90s visual kei movement.[6]
