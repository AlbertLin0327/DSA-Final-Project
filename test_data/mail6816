Carrington Colleges Group, Inc., formerly the U.S. Education Corporation, is a company based in Mission Viejo, California that acquires and develops for-profit private colleges and schools in the United States. Subsidiaries include Carrington College (formerly Apollo College) and Carrington College California (formerly Western Career College). The two colleges have 17 locations in the western United States with a student enrollment of over 8,500 and 65,000 alumni.[1] The company's schools offer career training in medical, veterinary, graphic design, and criminal justice fields. Carrington is a subsidiary of DeVry Incorporated.[2] DeVry Inc. acquired the organization in 2008 as part of a strategy to expand DeVry's health care program offerings at the pre-baccalaureate level.[1] The U.S. Education Corporation, led by president and chief executive officer George Montgomery since 2002, first united Apollo College and Western Career College under the same umbrella in 2003. The two schools were renamed "Carrington College" and "Carrington College California," respectively, after DeVry acquired the U.S. Education Corporation (which became "Carrington Colleges Group, Inc."). The name changes took effect on June 30, 2010.[3] The enrollment of new students in the Carrington Colleges declined in 2010 by 19 percent  more than DeVry had anticipated. The total enrollment in the college group also fell, with the number of total students placed at 10,942 in December 2010.[4] Montgomery is retiring at the end of 2011; he will be succeeded as president of the group by Robert Paul, DeVry University's vice president for metro operations.[5]
