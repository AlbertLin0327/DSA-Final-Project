The 1964 World 600 is a NASCAR Grand National Series (now Sprint Cup Series) event that took place on May 24, 1964 at the Charlotte Motor Speedway in the American community of Concord, North Carolina.[2][3] This race took place in the daytime because the lights for nighttime racing were not installed until 1992 (for the 8th NASCAR All-Star Race in its "modern day" history). The race covered four hundred laps of a paved oval track spanning 1.500 miles (2.414km). It took four hours, forty-six minutes, and fourteen seconds for the race to go from the first green flag to the checkered flag.[2][3] Seven cautions were given out by NASCAR officials for forty-eight laps.[2] Notable speeds were: 125.772 miles per hour (202.410km/h) for the average speed and 144.346 miles per hour (232.302km/h) for the pole position speed.[2][3] There was a live attendance of exactly 66,311 racing fans.[2][3] Jim Paschal defeated Richard Petty by more than four laps.[2] Other notable drivers included: Ralph Earnhardt, Roy Tyner, Fireball Roberts, Elmo Langley, and Buddy Baker.[2][3] The top two finishers were teammates at Petty Enterprises (now Richard Petty Motorsports).[2][3] Jim Paschal would receive $24,785 ($185,727.94 considering inflation) in prize money after becoming the only driver to finish all 400 laps of the race.[2][3] Pete Stewart was rewarded with $600 ($4,496.14 in today's money) for finishing only one lap; resulting in a last place finish.[2][3] Billy Wade started in pole position while the winner started in 12th place.[2][3] Fireball Roberts ended up in a terrible crash in this race while trying to avoid Junior Johnson and Ned Jarrett's crash on lap 7.[2][3][4] Roberts was sent to Charlotte hospital by a team of emergency paramedics.[4] While he was not seriously injured by the crash itself, Roberts was trapped when his ankle became pinned up from under the dashboard and caught by either the clutch or brake pedal.[4] The death would have occurred at the speedway if Jarrett hadn't pulled Roberts out in time.[4] Instead, he died in hospital on July 2 of that year; leaving behind a wife (Mrs. Doris Roberts) and a young daughter (Pamela Jane Roberts Trivette).[4] Many fans could hear Roberts screaming "My God, Ned, help me! I'm on fire!" after being caught on fire because of the crash.[5] Before the fatal accident, Roberts was going to announce his retirement from the NASCAR Cup Series after the race to work as a spokesperson for a beer company.[5] Fireball, as he was known to his racing fans and to his fellow drivers, was the first superstar of the superspeedway era.[5] He would be followed by Darrell Waltrip, Dale Earnhardt, and other drivers who would compete in the Cup Series during the decades that would come after Roberts' death. Doctors ultimately blamed his death on pneumonia and he spent the last 39 days of his life at Charlotte Memorial Hospital (now Carolinas Medical Center) in extremely critical condition.[5] The entire week from April 29 through May 1, 1964 ultimately became one of the darkest weeks in motorsports history as Eddie Sachs and Dave McDonald were both killed in that year's Indianapolis 500. Actual home video footage of the accident was being recorded as the race occurred. The race was being televised by local CBS affiliate WBTV. Roberts' body was eventually delivered to his burial crypt in Daytona Beach, Florida.[5] One of the quotes that came in an earlier race sometime prior to his death was "I fear fire the most!"  signifies that the driver is known to be deceased * Driver failed to finish race
