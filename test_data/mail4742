Toshigami (?) is a Kami of the Shinto religion in Japan. The term consists of from two Chinese characters, toshi (, year?) and kami (?), meaning a deity or spirit. Toshigami are thought to be deities of the year believed to bring with each New Year. Toshigami are also thought to be the spirits of ancestors.
