A Heap of Broken Images is the debut album by instrumental hip hop duo Blue Sky Black Death. It was released on June 23, 2006 by Mush Records. The album is a double album release, with the first disc featuring twelve instrumental tracks (with a mix of sampling and live instrumentation), and the second disc featuring one instrumental and nine of their beats matched with vocals from a number of guest rappers. The guests include Jus Allah of Jedi Mind Tricks, Wise Intelligent of Poor Righteous Teachers, Sabac Red of Non Phixion, A-Plus and Pep Love of Hieroglyphics, Chief Kamachi of Army of the Pharaohs, Guru of Gang Starr, Mike Ladd, Rob Sonic, Holocaust, Myka 9 of Freestyle Fellowship, Virtuoso and Awol One. Later in 2006, the duo released a full-length collaboration album with Holocaust, titled Blue Sky Black Death presents: The Holocaust. The album title comes from the T. S. Eliot poem The Waste Land ("A heap of broken images, where the sun beats, and the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief").[4][5]
