Line 8 of the Beijing Subway (Chinese: 8; pinyin: bijng dti bhoxin), formerly known as the Olympic Branch Line (), is a rapid transit line in northern Beijing. The line currently has ten stations and runs 15.1km from Huilongguan Dongdajie (Huilongguan Avenue East) in Changping District in the northern suburbs to Beitucheng in Chaoyang District. The entire line runs underground. Line 8's color is green. Line 8 opened on July 19, 2008 as the Olympic Branch Line to serve the Olympic Green during the 2008 Summer Olympics. The line had only four stations and 4.53km of track. On December 31, 2011, a section of Line 8 opened to the north, extending the line to its current form.[2] Line 8 sits on the central north-south axis of the city of Beijing, which is aligned through the Drum Tower, the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, and Yongdingmen. The line is being expanded along the central axis in both directions. By 2013, Line 8 will be extended further south to the National Art Museum in Dongcheng District, near the city centre.

The last south-bound train leaves Huilongguan Dong Dajie at 10:13pm. The last north-bound train leaves Beitucheng at 10:50pm. For the official timetable, see [1]. In the north, Line 8 begins at Huilongguan Dongdajie (Huilongguan Avenue East), in Huilongguan, a suburban residential neighborhood in southern Changping District. The line heads south through the Line 13 arc at Huoying to the Olympic Forest Park and makes three stops in the Olympic Green. Line 8 terminates at Beitucheng where a transfer is available to Line 10. Line 8 has been planned and built in several phases. Line 8 was originally was planned and built as a short line off of Line 10 to serve the 2008 Olympic Games and was known as the Olympic Branch Line.[3] The line was included in Beijing's bid for the 29th Summer Olympiad, which was awarded to the city in 2001. Construction began in 2004[4] and the line entered into operation together with Line 10 on July 19, 2008. In Phase I, Line 8 branched off of Line 10 at Beitucheng for three stops to the South Gate of Forest Park. The line was only 4.35km in length. Access was originally restricted to riders with an Olympic Register Card or a ticket to an event at the Olympic Games or Paralympic Games on the day of the event. In early October 2008, the line was fully opened to the public.  While Phase I of the Line 8 was still under construction, work began on the second phase on December 8, 2007.[5] In Phase II, the line was planned to be extended to both north and south along Beijing's central and in 2008, was estimated to cost 10.1 billion and scheduled to be completed by 2012.[6][7] The northern extension, 10.7km in length with six stations, runs through the Olympic Forest Park to Huilongguan in Changping District beyond the Line 13 arc. Land clearing for Phase II began in December 2007.[8][6] Tunnel boring machines began work on October 16, 2009[9] In the fall of 2011, the entire Line 8 shut down and the entire line including the Phase II northern extension reopened on December 31, 2011.[2][9] Plans for Phase II North originally showed the following stations:[6] The Lincui Lu station, just west of the Olympic Forest Park, was originally planned as an emergency stop, but was added at the behest of nearby residents and their municipal people's congress representative, Tian Yuan, who argued that the 5.1km gap between the Forest Park and Yongtai stations made subway access inconvenient for residents along Lincui Road.[10] The station was officially added to Phase II plans in December 2008. Inside a Line 8 train  The Zhuxinzhuang and Pingxifu stations are being built as part of the Line 8-Changping Connector, which extends Line 8 further north to the Changping Line.  To the south, Line 8 will enter the city centre via Gulou Dajie, the Drum Tower, and Houhai, and terminate at the National Art Museum.[11] The southern section, 6.8km in length and also with six stations, is slated for completion in 2013.[6][9] Planned stations of the southern section of Line 8 Phase II::[6]  In Phase III, Line 8 will be extended further south from the National Gallery of Art through Qianmen and Yongdingmen to beyond the southern 4th Ring Road. Planning began in 2009.[12] As of June 2011, plans of Line 8 in Phase III showed 14 stations over 17.3km.[13] Phase III is scheduled to be built by 2015.[13]
