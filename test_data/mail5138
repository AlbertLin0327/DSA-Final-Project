Genting Hotel, or commonly known as Maxims Genting Hotel is a premier hotel at Resorts World Genting with 244 suites. Along with Resort Hotel and Highlands Hotel, Maxims Genting houses Casino de Genting, one of the main casinos in Resorts World Genting. Genting Hotel was built in 1978 and was the second hotel built in Genting Highlands. The first hotel, Theme Park Hotel, was built in 1971. It was built as the Theme Park Hotel was unable to cope with the immense volume of visitors to Genting Highlands. It was also due to the relocation of two casinos which was initially located in Theme Park Hotel. The top floor houses the Maxims Club, a 6-star hotel.
