Lemieux is a ghost town in the Canadian province of Ontario, which was located on the shore of the South Nation River in the Prescott and Russell County township of South Plantagenet. The community was abandoned over a two-year period from 1989 to 1991, after soil testing revealed that the town was built on unstable Leda clay, a type of subsoil which can liquefy under stress, and was consequently in danger of experiencing a landslide similar to the one that destroyed the town of Saint-Jean-Vianney, Quebec in 1971. The decision to relocate the community's residents proved to be a wise one  on June 20, 1993, two years after the last remaining building at Lemieux was demolished, a landslide occurred at the former townsite. Lemieux, a predominantly Franco-Ontarian settlement, was first established in 1850 as a mill town for lumber operations in the area, and later evolved into a farming community. A Roman Catholic parish church, Saint-Joseph-de-Lemieux, was established in 1891. On May 16, 1971, just 12 days after the Saint-Jean-Vianney disaster, a smaller landslide occurred on the South Nation River 4.5 kilometres upstream from Lemieux.[1] As a result, the South Nation Conservation Authority began a program of soil testing along the river to identify sites at risk. In 1989, Lemieux was identified as a risk site, and after consultations with the township, the provincial Ministry of Natural Resources and the local residents, it was decided to relocate the residents to a safer area.[2] Over the next two years, the residents were relocated to existing nearby communities at provincial government expense.[3] Buildings in the community were either relocated or demolished. The last building remaining in Lemieux, the Saint-Joseph church, was demolished on August 4, 1991. Only the parish cemetery remains at the former town site. On June 20, 1993, two years after Lemieux was abandoned, heavy rains caused a retrogressive earthflow which destroyed 17 hectares of farmland at the town site. The scarp retreated 680 meters (2,230ft) from the riverbank in less than an hour and left a crater some 320 meters (1,050ft) wide and 18 meters (59ft) deep. An estimated 2.8 to 3.5 million cubic metres of sand, silt and liquefied clay collapsed into the river, damming it for 3.3 kilometers (2.1mi) for several days.[2][3] A portion of Prescott and Russell County Road 16, the main road through the town, was also consumed by the landslide. As the site was no longer populated, there were no fatalities. A local man, Steve Washam, was driving along Country Road 16 when the slide occurred. He and his truck fell into the crater, Washam having broken several bones in the crash, was rescued a short time after. Direct and indirect costs related to the event were estimated at CA$12.5 million.[3] The South Nation Conservation Authority began a revegetation program in 1994, seeding the landslide site with grasses, legumes and 7,600 trees to help stabilize the soil and reclaim the landslide scar as a wildlife habitat. The government of Ontario erected a historical plaque at the site of Lemieux's former main street.[2] Coordinates: 452343N 750333W / 45.39528N 75.05917W / 45.39528; -75.05917
