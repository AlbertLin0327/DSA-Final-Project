Camp Jossman was a United States Army cantonment constructed near the town of Buenavista on Guimaras Island in the Philippines after the Spanish-American War. Camp Jossman was named for Albert L. Jossman. Jossman, a graduate of the University of Michigan enlisted for the Spanish-American War as a member of the 35th Michigan Volunteer Infantry. He subsequently transferred to the 27th Michigan Regiment, and later joined the regular Army as a member of the 22nd Infantry Regiment. Jossman was subsequently commissioned as a Second Lieutenant, and was wounded at the Battle of Bayan. Second Lieutenant Jossman died in Manila on July 28, 1902 while en route to the United States on a furlough. Jossman's remains were returned to Michigan, and he received a military funeral in Detroit.[1] [2] The construction of a post on Guimaras Island was authorized by Congress in July, 1902. Subsequent acts of Congress authorized the expansion of the camp.[3] Camp Jossman was the base for the 19th Infantry Regiment and two battalions of Philippine Scouts.[4] In 1909 the facility was expanded to include the Punta Blanco target range.[5] 67 buildings were planned for Camp Jossman.[6] Not all of these buildings had been completed when the post was vacated.[7] While serving with the 3rd Engineer Battalion from 1902 to 1903, Douglas MacArthur, then a First Lieutenant, was responsible for construction of a wharf at Buenavista, as well as the road from the wharf to Camp Jossman.[8] Brigadier General George W. McIver, commander of the 81st Infantry Division's 161st Brigade in World War I, served at Camp Jossman from 1903 to 1905.[9] General Joseph Stilwell was assigned to Camp Jossman as a First Lieutenant from 1904 to 1906.[10] Lieutenant General William H.H. Morris served at Camp Jossman as a Second Lieutenant in 1911.[11] In 1912 the U.S. Army determined that there was no longer a need for bases on Guimaras Island, and Camp Jossman was vacated. The buildings and other infrastructure were subsequently demolished.[12] The site of Camp Jossman is now a reservoir under the jurisdiction of the Water District of Buenavista.[13]
