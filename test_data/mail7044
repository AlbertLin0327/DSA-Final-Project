Pierre Vimont (born June 15, 1949) is the Secretary-General of the European External Action Service (EEAS).[1] Vimont holds a licence in law. He is a graduate of the Institut d'tudes Politiques de Paris and the cole nationale d'administration (1977). His current rank in the French civil service is "Ambassadeur de France", which is properly not a rank but a "dignity" bestowed upon a diplomat for life (unlike the other career ranks which cease to produce effect upon retirement or otherwise leaving the foreign service). His first post was at the French Embassy in London, where he served as Second Secretary from 1977 to 1978 and First Secretary from 1978 to 1981. He then served at the Press and Information department in Paris from 1981 to 1985. From 1985 to 1986 he worked at the EastWest Institute in New York. Then he moved back to Europe to become the Second Councillor at the Permanent Representation of France at the European Community in Brussels, from 1986 to 1990. He subsequently became chief of staff to the minister delegate of European affairs from 1990 to 1993. He was the director for development and of scientific, technical, and educational cooperation (1993-1996) and subsequently the adjunct general director of cultural, scientific, and technical relations (1996-1997), and the director of European cooperation (1997-1999). From 1999 to 2002 he was the ambassador and permanent representative of France at the European Union in Brussels. From 2002 to 2007 he was the chief of staff for the minister.[2] French President Nicolas Sarkozy appointed him to the position of Ambassador to the United States on 1 August 2007. On 25 October 2010, he was selected by the European Union's (EU) High Representative to be the first Executive Secretary General of the European External Action Service, which began operation on 1 December 2010. He is a knight of the National Order of Merit. He speaks French, English and Spanish. Media related to Pierre Vimont at Wikimedia Commons
