The 1972 France rugby union tour of Australia was a series of nine matches played by the France national rugby union team in Australia in May and June 1972. The French team went through the tour unbeaten by winning eight of its nine matches and drawing the other. France won the two-match test series against Australia (the Wallabies) 10 with the other match drawn. As of 2010 this remains France's only series victory on Australian soil. 1949 1954 1960 1974 1977 1985 1986 1988 1992 1996 1998 2002 2003 2010 1961 1968 1972 1981 1986 1990 1997 2002 2005 2008 2009 1961 1968 1979 1984 1986 1989 1994 1999 2001 2003 2007 2009 1958 1964 1967 1971 1975 1980 1993 2001 2005 2006 2010 1991 USA 1994 Canada 1998 Fiji 1999 Samoa and Tonga 2004 USA and Canada
