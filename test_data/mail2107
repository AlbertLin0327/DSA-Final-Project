Claye Michael Young (31 December 1964 in Hobart, Tasmania) is a former Australian cricket player, who played three First-class cricket matches for Tasmania in the 1987-88 season. Clay Young was a right-arm fast-medium bowler who performed well in the Tasmanian Grade Cricket competition, earning him a call up to the state side in 1987. Although performing well in one match, taking figures of 6/120 in one innings, he failed to cement a place in the side, and was not recalled. Clay is the older brother of the Tasmanian cricketer, Shaun Young.
