The 1st arrondissement of Paris is one of the 20 arrondissements (administrative districts) of the capital city of France. Situated principally on the right bank of the River Seine, it also includes the west end of the le de la Cit. The arrondissement is one of the oldest in Paris, the le de la Cit having been the heart of the city of Lutetia, conquered by the Romans in 52 BC, while some parts on the right bank (including Les Halles) date back to the early Middle Ages. It is the least populated of the city's arrondissements and one of the smallest by area, a significant part of which is occupied by the Louvre Museum and the Tuileries Gardens. Much of the remainder of the arrondissement is dedicated to business and administration. The 1st arrondissement is very small, with a land area of only 1,83km2 (0.705 sq. miles, or 451 acres). The area now occupied by the first arrondissement attained its peak population in the period preceding the re-organization of Paris in 1860. In 1999, the population was 16,888, while the arrondissement hosted 63,056 jobs, making it one of the most active for business after the 2nd, 8th, and 9th. The peak of population actually occurred before 1861, but the arrondissement was created in 1860, so there are no figures before 1861. Each of the 20 Paris arrondissements is divided into four quarters (quartiers). The table below lists the four quarters of the 1st arrondissement: figures from 1999 French census Korean Air's France office is in the 1st arrondissement.[1] At one time Air Inter's head office was located in the first arrondissement.[2] When Minerve, an airline, existed, its head office was in the first arrondissement.[3] In terms of state-operated schools, the first arrondissement has two nursery schools (coles maternelles), two primary schools (coles lmentaires), one cole polyvalente, one high school (collge), and one sixth form college (lyce).[4] The state-operated nursery schools are cole Maternelle Auxerrois and cole Maternelle Sourdiere.[4] The state-operated primary schools are cole lmentaire Arbre Sec and cole lmentaire D'Argenteuil.[4][5] The arrondissement has one cole polyvalente, cole Polyvalente Cambon.[6] Collge Jean-Baptiste Poquelin is the sole state-operated high school in the arrondissement.[7] Lyce Professionnel Commercial Pierre Lescot is the sole state-operated sixth form college in the first arrondissement.[8] Private primary and secondary institutions in the arrondissement include cole lmentaire Prive Notre-Dame-Saint-Roch, cole du 2nd Degr Professionnel Prive Pigier, and cole Technologique Prive de Dessin Technique et Artistique Sornas.[4] Coordinates: 485136N 22028E / 48.86N 2.34111E / 48.86; 2.34111
