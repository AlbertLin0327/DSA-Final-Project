Louise Lorraine (October 1, 1904  February 2, 1981) was an American film actress. Born Louise Escovar in San Francisco, California in 1904,[1] Louise Lorraine's rise to film happened quite accidentally.[citation needed] A photography salesman knocked on the door of the Los Angeles home where Louise lived with her widowed mother and five siblings one day. It was the 13-year old Louise who answered the door. The salesman was so taken aback by her look and demeanor that he told her mother that she should be in movies, and he had a contact at the Ince Studio who could make it happen. At first, Louise's mother refused, but eventually gave in.[citation needed] The young woman started out in two-reel comedies for independent studios, then spent time at MGM and Universal. She became very popular in action-filled serials such as The Radio King and With Stanley in Africa in 1922. She starred in 11 in all, showing much energy and charisma, not as much seen in many of her colleagues in that genre. Louise was selected one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars in 1922. Louise is perhaps best-remembered for being the third actress to portray Jane, having portrayed the character in the 1921 movie serial The Adventures of Tarzan. Louise starred in only five talkies in her film career, including Near the Rainbow's End in 1930, co-starring Bob Steele. Following this film, she retired from the film industry to devote her time with her husband and two children. She married twice. Her first marriage to actor Art Acord ended in divorce in 1928. Her second marriage to Chester J. Hubbard ended in 1963 upon his death. She had two children. She died in 1981 in New York City, aged 76. Her interment was in Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery.
