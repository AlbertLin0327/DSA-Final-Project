Human Rights in China (simplified Chinese: ; traditional Chinese: ; pinyin: Zhnggu Rnqun) is a New York-based international, Chinese, non-governmental organization with a mission to promote international human rights and advance the institutional protection of these rights in the People's Republic of China.[1][2] HRIC is a member organization of the International Federation for Human Rights.[3] According to Fang Lizhi, HRIC s committed to an independent, non-political, and intelligent approach[4] Founded by Chinese students and scholars in March 1989, HRIC [Human Rights In China] implements programs to generate institutional, systemic change in China while also engaging in critical advocacy strategies on behalf of individuals in China.[2][5][6] With offices in Hong Kong and New York,[7] HRIC serves as a source of analysis and information on the human rights situation in China, as well as an active NGO advocate in the international arena. In 2005, HRIC was also recognized for its creative and effective use of technology by The Tech Museum of Innovation as one of twenty-five Tech Award Laureates of the year.[8] HRIC's Executive Director from 2002 to present[update] is Sharon Hom. Its former Executive Director is Xiao Qiang. With a diverse network of domestic and international partners[citation needed], HRIC links individual advocacy with systemic and policy interventions addressing human rights, technology, legal and administrative reform issues. HRIC's core programs and reports address human rights violations affecting China's rural population,[9] migrant workers,[10] ethnic minorities,[11] women,[12] and children.[13] HRIC's domestic work with political prisoners provides support for legal representation and assistance to activists in China[citation needed]. HRIC works with domestic Chinese groups internationally and domestically[citation needed] in calling upon the Chinese government to engage in a constructive reassessment of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and subsequent crackdown and to move toward greater reforms and social stability. By supporting domestic groups such as the Tiananmen Mothers, HRIC links Chinese calls for redress to current international debates such as lifting the European Union arms embargo on China. HRIC's online June 4 Archive,[14] is a Chinese-language archive documenting the history of the 1989 Tiananmen democracy movement. HRIC also maintains Fill the Square,[15] an online petition mobilizing individuals and organizations worldwide to support the Tiananmen Mothers' demands for accountability for the June Fourth crackdown[citation needed]. HRIC's advocacy initiatives contribute to multilateral and bilateral human rights policy discussions, analyses, and recommendations. HRIC provides briefings and reports to United Nations bodies, international conferences, WTO processes, and the EU-China Dialogue. As of 2006, HRIC has submitted over 40 individual cases of the victims of human rights abuses to the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; 13 of the cases have had decisions made on them, and all of the 13 have been deemed arbitrary.[16] HRIC regularly addresses the relationship between corporate social responsibility, trade, and human rights through reports, briefings, and presentations, thus contributing to a global framework that respects and promotes human rights. HRIC has outlined a best practices matrix for IT companies doing business in China[17] involving information communication technology (ICT), surveillance and security, multilaterals, the media, governments, and NGOs. HRIC's online advocacy project supports Chinese citizens' increasing activism and promotes the free flow of information in China by building a technology platform that uses proxy server technology and a biweekly e-newsletter[18] sent to hundreds of thousands of subscribers in China.[citation needed] The project includes the development of six interrelated Web sites with online Chinese publications, tools for accountability, and advocacy resources. China Rights Forum is HRIC's bilingual quarterly journal. Since its founding in 1990, it has covered a range of issues regarding China's human rights developments. It includes articles from Chinese scholars, artists, writers and activists promoting democratic reform, labor rights, freedom of expression, and the rights of religious and ethnic minorities and disadvantaged groups. Archives of the articles are available online. Biweekly Chinese Journal () is a Chinese-language biweekly journal publishing in-depth analyses, current events commentaries, theoretical discussions, and law reviews, in addition to news from China that has been banned and censored in the mainland. Issues covered have included torture and corruption in China, Internet censorship, and China's legal system. The majority of the contributors and readers are mainland Chinese Internet users. Daily News Brief is HRIC's daily news roundup. HRIC's research fuels a range of reports and publications such as thematic reports and briefings, issues backgrounders, trends bulletins, and short reports on topical issues involving ethnic minorities, women and children, control of the media, labor rights and state secrets, legal reform, and social unrest. HRIC regularly issues reports on human rights issues and circulates them to multilateral bodies, media, policy makers, governments, and NGOs. In 2004, HRIC published researcher and economist He Qinglian's Media Control in China, a Chinese-language report countering China's claims to easing controls on the media by openly portraying the oppressive, often violent, and lethal consequences of overstepping the government's limitations on freedom of speech and of the press. An update was released in July 2006. This report has been widely circulated on Chinese Web sites, in classrooms, and at conferences. In 2008 the report was translated into English and published as The Fog of Censorship: Media Control in China; an ebook is also available on the organization's homepage. HRIC is funded by private foundations and individuals from Europe, Asia, and North America. HRIC obtained supported from the Open Society Institute, the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development, the European Human Rights Foundation, Human Rights Watch, Asia Watch, etc.[19] It also receives funding from National Endowment for Democracy (NED).[20] The New York University School of Law honored Robert L. Bernstein by establishing the Robert L. Bernstein Fellowship in International Human Rights in 2006, annually providing an opportunity for a recent School of Law graduate to engage in full-time human rights work at HRIC.[21]
