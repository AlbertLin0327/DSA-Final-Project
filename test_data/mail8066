Jem Magazine was founded by Joe Weider in the 1950s as entertainment for heterosexual men. The monthly periodical was encouraged by American News distributors which asked Weider to start a competitor publication to rival the success Hugh Hefner had achieved with Playboy Magazine. Jem Magazine published photos of topless models and featured articles about dining, nightlife, and wine. Its companion magazine was Monsieur. Jem Magazine was quickly successful although Weider says that he was never very interested in its viability.[1] A number of Jem Magazine issues feature Weider's wife, Betty Brosmer, an attractive blonde model, on their covers.[2] The February 1960 issue of Jem Magazine features fiction, humor, article, and models. Gypsy Rose Lee is the feature interview. Fiction pieces are entitled The Girl From Denmark, The Nude On The Beach, and This Guy.[3] First Issue is November 1956 with Candy Barr on the cover.
