Lake of the Woods County is a county located in the U.S. state of Minnesota. As of the 2010 census, the population was 4,045.[1] Its county seat is Baudette[2]. The county contains the Northwest Angle, the northernmost point of the Lower 48 States, and includes the U.S. portion of Lake of the Woods, shared with Canada. The county also includes the exclave of Elm Point. Since Alaska has no counties, Lake of the Woods is the northernmost county in the United States, by definition. As of the census[3] of 2000, there were 4,522 people, 1,903 households, and 1,267 families residing in the county. The population density was 4 people per square mile (1/km). There were 3,238 housing units at an average density of 2 per squaremile (1/km).

About 6.70% of families and 9.80% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.30% of those under age 18 and 10.60% of those age 65 or over. Lake of the Woods County was named because the lake covers a large portion of the county. Jacques de Noyon, a Frenchman who came from Trois Rivires, (Quebec), explored this area in 1688 and became the first white man to view the lake. He named the lake Lac aux les which means "Lake of the Islands" in English. In 1885 the region of Lake of the Woods got its first settler, Wilhem Zippel, who was a German immigrant and a fisherman. He settled on the south shore of the lake in a place now called Zippel Bay. Shortly after, Alonzo Wheeler settled on a point on the southwest side of the lake which is now called Wheeler's Point. A terrible wildfire, which has come to be known as the Baudette Fire of 1910, broke out in October of that year, burning 300,000 acres (1,200km2) and destroying the towns of Spooner, Baudette, Graceton, Pitt, Williams, and Cedar Spur.[4] Lake of the Woods County was founded January 1, 1923, with Baudette as the original county seat. Lake of the Woods County is also known as Minnesota's youngest county. This county was organized on November 28, 1922, when residents voted to separate the northern Townships. According to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of 1,775.05 square miles (4,597.4km2), of which 1,296.70 square miles (3,358.4km2) (or 73.05%) is land and 478.35 square miles (1,238.9km2) (or 26.95%) is water.[5] Although all the townships are named, as of 2001, there are no township governments. All the townships are officially part of unorganized territory.[citation needed] * These townships were created out of Forest Area Township after the 2000 Census.  Most of Roosevelt is in Roseau County, but according to the 2000 Census, 3 people live on the 0.1km2 (0sqmi) that extends into Lake of the Woods. This populated place also has portions in an adjacent county or counties Coordinates: 4846N 9454W / 48.77N 94.90W / 48.77; -94.90
