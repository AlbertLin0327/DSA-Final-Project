Danielle Senior is a London-based singer and songwriter, originally from Devon in the United Kingdom.[1] Senior also spent part of her childhood in Norway, Scandinavia. She is currently signed to Notting Hill Music Publishing.[2] She has written and performed on a broad range of music including pop, dance, and urban. Danielle Senior's first collaborative effort was on Shystie's single "One Wish", on which she co-wrote and sang backing vocals. "One Wish" was the lead single taken from the "Diamond in the Dirt" album, and was released through Polydor Records[3] in 2004. Around the same time she also contributed vocals to upcoming artist Plan B's debut album Who Needs Actions When You Got Words (679 Recordings), on which she played the part of a newsreader on the album track entitled "Suzanne". Senior then set up her own label called Breakproof through which she released and distributed her own self-penned music, (One Day EP[4]), making waves on the urban underground scene with her cover of the Rose Royce classic "I Wanna Get Next To You", which she simply called "Next 2 U" ft. Plan B & Wretch 32.[5][6] Through persistent underground releases she eventually caught the eye of All Around The World Records who signed her shortly after due to the popularity of her song "Take It To The Dancefloor", which she wrote. A club, radio and TV hit (reaching no.3 in the UK Music Week Commercial/Club Chart 2009), "Take It To The Dancefloor" can be cited as Danielle Senior's commercial breakthrough and brought about a national PA tour, alongside artists such as N-Dubz and the Wideboys.[6][7][8] After signing with Notting Hill Music Publishing in 2009, Senior began to write songs for other artists. Her first song placement "Honeytrap/Satisfaction Guaranteed" was covered by the Asian superstar Jolin Tsai and peaked at number 3 in the Yes 93.3 Music Chart.[9] As the lead single from Jolin's album "Myself", it helped catapult the album to the top of the G-Music chart for several weeks.[10] During this time Danielle also co-wrote "Safety Net" for Lin Yu Chun, dubbed Tawain's Susan Boyle [11]. 'Safety Net" was also used as part of a governmental campaign for Peace in Tawain. Recent releases for Danielle Senior include "Every Emotion" Aura ft. Danielle Senior, which was signed to Love Rush Digital UK in late 2010.[12][13] This release peaked at no.17 in the UK Music Week Upfront Club Chart 2011 and has appeared on various compilations. The follow up Aura ft. Danielle Senior, "Wearing My Shoes" was signed to N.E.W.S Records in Benelux in May 2012 and has been licensed throughout Europe and Asia. "Every Emotion" is due to be released as a Danielle Senior solo record in summer 2012, following on from the success of her feature. In the meantime, Danielle Senior has been working with the Wideboys, Tastemaker Music, The White N3rd, Rob Davis, and Allan Eshuijs. Danielle Senior Discogs
