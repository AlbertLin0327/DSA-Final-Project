It's being published by the Groupe Nicolas group. Before April 2011, when Groupe Nicolas removed "Ltzebuerg" from all the media they publish, the newspaper was known as "Ltzebuerg Privat". The publisher is the third biggest one in Luxembourg. It's the only publisher which is not a member of the "Conseil de Presse" and does not cooperate with the "Service d'Information et Presse". At the moment, the weekly newspaper Privat, the online newspaper LuxPrivat.lu, the web radio Radio-Privat, the web-tv Privat-TV, the paper about celebrities Promi and the satirical paper d'Wschfra are part of the group. On March 30, 2011, the group started a campaign called "Fir eng Fri Press zu Ltzebuerg! Gint Zensur!", which means as much as "For a free press in Luxembourg! Against Censorship!" [1] On November 3, 2006, the first Privat Ltzebuerg newspaper released, with Jean Nicolas as publisher, Heinz Kerp as Editor, and Sven Gnther as Chief Editor.[2] The web page belonging to the newspaper was launched on January 4, 2011. The mark of 2 million web page visitors was reached within one year.[3] The web radio Privat was launched on March 1, 2011 and streams on work days between 8 am and 6 pm.[4] Privat-TV first released on February 25, 2011 online.[5] All the reports created for Privat-TV get created in cooperation with Simba Pro. The first release of Promi Ltzebuerg came out in the beginning of 2008. The topic is mostly about the lives of Luxembourg's celebrities and the high-society. February 5, 2010, the first release of d'Wschfra came out. In the paper, well-known people (e. g. politicians or celebrities) are being made fun of.[6] The paper has got its name from a satirical newspaper which has been very successful.
