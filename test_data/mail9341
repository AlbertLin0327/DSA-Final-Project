Sir Montagu Harry Proctor-Beauchamp, 7th Baronet (19 April 1860  26 October 1939)[1] was a British Protestant Christian missionary. Proctor-Beauchamp was the fourth son of Sir Thomas William Brograve Proctor-Beauchamp, 4th Baronet, and his wife the Hon. Catherine Esther, daughter of Granville Waldegrave, 2nd Baron Radstock. He was educated at Repton and Trinity College, Cambridge.[2] Proctor-Beauchamp was one of the Cambridge Seven, students from Cambridge University, who in 1885 decided to become missionaries in China. He served with the China Inland Mission during the late Qing Dynasty in China. Proctor-Beauchamp married Florence, daughter of Robert Barclay, in 1892. They had several children. He succeeded in the Proctor-Beauchamp baronetcy in 1915 when his elder brother Horace was killed in the First World War. He died in October 1939, aged 79, and was succeeded in his title by his third but eldest surviving son, Ivor. Lady Proctor-Beauchamp died in May 1955.
