Dee Jaywalker is a Belgian punk rock musician and songwriter. He is best known as lead guitar player and songwriter for Marky Ramone & the Speedkings. Jaywalker started his career as a punk rocker in the late 70s, releasing a first single "Tropical Stumble" with Organized Pleasure in 1980. The single immediately became a radio hit and stayed in the charts for 10 weeks. His work with Definitivos gave Jaywalker his first major break in the Belgian punk scene. After putting out several records from 1980 to 1985, Definitivos became The Whydads and released a full album in 1988 before calling it quits in 1989. A couple of Definitivos singles later appeared on the famous Bloodstains Compilations. From then on, Jaywalker performed with many bands, most notably The Midnight Men, Goldengalaxyjerks and Faroutski - with whom he released a CD and toured in the UK. Around the same time, as a side project, Jaywalker started the rockabilly band The Greyhounddogs, which attracted a following in Belgium. In 2004, Devilshitburner Records released We're getting closer to the grave each day, a punk/heavy metal/rockabilly tribute to Hank Williams, for which The Greyhounddogs recorded a cover of "Lost highway". In 2001, Jaywalker joined Marky Ramone & the Speedkings, who put out a first album, No If's And's or But's on White Jazz Records/JVC Japan. The band did three European tours, and released a live album, Alive, on Rawk-A-Hula Records in 2002. The band released the album Legends Bleed in 2002 on Thirsty Ear Records and did a world tour from 2002 to January 2003. Five 7-inches came out from 2002 to the end of 2003, including a split single with Texas Terri. From 2004 on Jaywalker has performed as a solo artist, writing and recording his punk 'n' roll stuff with his solo band. His solo album, 59 O'Clock, was released in 2006 on Nicotine Records In 2007, Jaywalker and music journalist Thomas 'thomaxe' Goze organized a Euro Tour for ex-Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers guitarist Walter Lure.
