Arethusa Leigh-White was the second World Association Director, whose nine years in office ended in 1947. She had the difficult years of World War II to contend with, and spent some time in the Western Hemisphere building Girl Guiding there. The immediate postwar reconstruction in Europe came under her guidance, and she and J. S. Wilson had to address and adjust policy accordingly.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
