Vanetina is a village in the Municipality of Cerkvenjak in northeastern Slovenia. It lies in the Slovene Hills (Slovene: Slovenske gorice). The area was part of the traditional region of Lower Styria and is now included in the Drava statistical region.[2] The local chapel-shrine was built in around 1900 and has a large belfry.[3] Administrative centre: Cerkvenjak
