Mata-Utu (Uvean: Matutu) is the capital of the Wallis and Futuna Territory. It is located on the island of Wallis (Uvea), in the district of Hahake, of which it is also the capital. Its population (2003 census) is 1,191 [1]. Downtown Mata-Utu is dominated by the Mat'Utu Cathedral, a French national monument. Within its vicinity there are, as well as several restaurants, hotels and the post office, the palace of the King of Uva (one of the three traditional kingdoms that the overseas territory is divided into). A short distance out of town are the police station and shopping mall. Near Mata-Utu are two important archaeological sites: Talietumu and Tonga Toto.
