The Vapors is a song by American hip hop artist Biz Markie. It was released in 1988 from his debut album Goin' Off. The song is featured on the fictional radio station Playback FM in the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. "The Vapors" represents the ironic life story of Biz Markie and his fellow Juice Crew members TJ Swan, Big Daddy Kane, and Cutmaster Cool V. It is said in the song that their early lives were miserable and hard, they were unwanted, hated, and disrespected. Now that they are famous musicians, people who disrespected them in their childhood are "getting the Vapors", which means that their treatment to them changed, and now they want to be friends of them, borrow money, offer jobs, etc..
