Queen of the Falls is a 2011 fiction novel by children's writer Chris Van Allsburg. Queen of the Falls is about a 62 year old woman named Annie Edson Taylor who remembers getting closer and closer to Niagara Falls with her father entranced by the sight and sound of the water. Finally, as a 62 year old, she goes over the falls in a wooden barrel, seeking fortune and fame.
