Founded in 1962, Wings of Hope is the oldest and largest volunteer, humanitarian, aviation based charity in the world. Headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, they organize and maintain over 3,000 volunteers in 154 bases in 45 countries. Wings of Hope is strictly humanitarian, meaning they have no religious or political agenda. In fact, they do not accept support from the American government [1] and do not forward funds to any foreign government agencies. The organization focuses strictly on supplying resources to raise the poor to a level of self sufficiency. The charity has been nominated for the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize. Wings of Hope, Inc., operates worldwide in 45 countries and thus is viewed as a world resource. Villages are not required to meet any conditions to receive aid. 90% of all funds generally are directed to their program services [2]. Major portions of their efforts are focused in the following areas: The Medical Air Transport System (MAT) is a unique service offered in the United States in 26 states. The MAT locates and arranges for advanced health care, usually for children with massive birth defects and then transports them to and from that care for years until all treatments are completed. The services is provided at no-cost and the organization does not accept reimbursement from insurers or the government. Wings of Hope operates over 150 bases in 45 countries. The goal is not simply to provide aid but rather to help communities achieve self-sufficiency [3] and sustainable development. The volunteers come from varied backgrounds and professions, from mechanics to doctors, and together they help the sick, teach, build a community, develop businesses, and do everything conceivable to build a region into a level of being able to take care of itself. Bases are located throughout North, Central, and South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Australia. Since 1962, approximately 18 bases have closed because the organization deemed that the communities had achieved sustainable self-sufficiency.
