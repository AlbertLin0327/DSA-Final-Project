Jack Chanin (1907-1997) was a performer, demonstrator, manufacturer, creator, and magic shop owner.[1] He ran Philadelphia's oldest magic studio, Chanin's Studio of Magic, until 1981. He also performed as an Oriental act under the name Cha-Nin. He marketed hundreds of effects of his own invention, including the Mesh Egg Bag.[2] Jack Chanin seemed to be able to reach into the pile behind the counter and produce anything a customer wanted.[3]
