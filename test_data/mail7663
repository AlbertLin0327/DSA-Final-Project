The Digital Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial (DMIST), is a multi-institutional research study on the efficacy for screening of Full Field digital mammography compared to conventional film-screen mammography that was sponsored by the U.S. National Cancer Institute and performed by ACRIN. The findings[1][2] that FFDM was not inferior to the existing technology, and potentially superior in younger women with dense breasts, has led to a rapid proliferation of digital systems in the US.
