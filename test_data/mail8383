Tasos Vidouris (Greek:   1888-1967) was a Greek poet and author. He was born in the village of Dhrovjani (Delvin District) in modern southern Albania. After finishing ground studies in his village Vidouris entered the Phanar Greek Orthodox College in Istambul. With his graduation he became a Greek language teacher in his home place as well as in several other Greek schools in the region. In ca. 1930 he moved to Patras, Greece, and in 1938 he published his first collection of several short stories under the title Diigimata (Greek: ).[1] Vidouris also became Professor in the local University, for a while, shortly before his death in 1967.[2] Tasos Vidouris published his main collection of poetry under the title Ilissia (Greek: ). His poetic style follows Naturalism, as it tried to describe local customs and psychological states. He also translated several known works from French to Greek.[1] Benefactors: Alexandros Vasileiou  Apostolos Arsakis  Evangelos and Konstantinos Zappas  Ioannis Pangas  Georgios and Simon Sinas  Alexandros and Michael Vasileiou  Christakis Zografos  Literature: Theodore Kavalliotis  Katina Papa  Konstantinos Skenderis  Takis Tsiakos  Tasos Vidouris  Stavrianos Vistiaris  Andreas Zarbalas  Politics: Vasil Bollano  Georgios Christakis-Zografos  Vangjel Dule  Spiro Ksera  Military/Resistance: Kyriakoulis Argyrokastritis  Panos Bitsilis  Dimitrios Doulis  Konstantinos Lagoumitzis  Zachos Milios  Athanasios Pipis  Ioannis Poutetsis  Vasilios Sahinis  Spyromilios  Spyros Spyromilios  Sports: Pyrros Dimas  Sotiris Ninis  Panajot Pano  Leonidas Sabanis  Andreas Tatos  Clergy: Vasileios of Dryinoupolis  Panteleimon Kotokos Eulogios Kourilas
