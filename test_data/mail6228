The Mercedes-Benz 5G-TRONIC (also called 722.6) is an electronically shifted 5-speed overdrive automatic transmission. It is in the process of being replaced by the Mercedes Benz 7G-Tronic Transmission which was introduced in 2003. However, all V12-powered cars such as the S600 and S65 AMG still retain the 5G-Tronic, which has a torque capacity of 796 lb-ft, as the newer 7G-Tronic is limited to 542 lb-ft, not enough to handle the torque from the V12 engine.[1] Also, while rear-wheel drive W211 E-Class cars have adapted the 7G-Tronic, those with 4MATIC retain the five-speed automatic, although the current generation W212 E-Class released for the 2010 model year has dropped the 5G-Tronic entirely, except for four-cylinder models. In Chrysler applications this transmission is identified as the New Automatic Gearbox- Generation One, or NAG1. A performance feature set for the Mercedes-Benz transmissions, which includes manual mode, active downshifting. When cornering at high speed, the transmission maintains the same gear above a certain lateral acceleration level. It can also automatically downshift before overtaking. It was first used in 2001 Mercedes-Benz C 32 AMG.[4], 2001 Mercedes-Benz SLK 32 AMG.[5] A version with mechanical lock-up of the torque converter from first gear, steering-wheel-mounted shifter. AMG SPEEDSHIFT is also used in 7G-TRONIC transmission.[6] It was first used in 2002 Mercedes-Benz E 55 AMG, S 55 AMG, C55, CL 55 AMG.[7] A version used in Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren. It includes 3 manual modes.
