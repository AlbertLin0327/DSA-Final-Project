Bronwyn Jane Pike (born 25 January 1956)[1] is a former Australian politician. She was Minister for Education in Victoria in the Brumby Government, and was the Member of Parliament for Melbourne from 1999 to 2012. Prior to entering Parliament, Pike worked as a teacher, a community services manager and as the Director of the Unit of Justice and Social Responsibility in the Uniting Church. She is also a former Board Director of Greenpeace Australia. Pike has a long history of advocating for social change, equality and the disadvantaged. Pike has a son, Paul Coats, who is a former University of Melbourne Postgraduate Association President and an active socialist.[2][3] Pike entered politics in 1999, at age 43. She was appointed the Minister for Housing and Aged Care and Minister Assisting the Health Minister in the government of Steve Bracks. In 2002 she was appointed as Minister for Community Services and Minister Assisting the Premier on Community Building. In May 2007, Pike became the longest-serving female minister in Victoria's history, along with Lynne Kosky. Pike announced her resignation from parliament on 7 May 2012 which will trigger a Melbourne by-election.[4] Following the re-election of the Bracks government in late 2002, Pike was promoted to Minister for Health. On 2 August 2007, newly appointed Premier John Brumby announced a cabinet reshuffle, as a result of which Pike was moved from the Health portfolio and took on Education. Pike spearheaded the $1.9 billion Victorian Schools Plan to rebuild and modernise 500 Victorian schools over the four year term of government. This included upgrades to technology wings; re-equipping science class rooms; building new schools in growth corridors. A key focus of this rebuilding program is encouraging joint-use of school and community facilities in areas ranging from libraries to sports fields. By 2011 more than 900 schools will have been rebuilt or modernised. The program has been tarnished by use of tactics to force school councils to vote for closure or merger of small schools by threatening to limit funds to the minimum amount as well as other tactics.[5]
