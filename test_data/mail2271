Pips, Chips & Videoclips are a rock band from Zagreb, Croatia. They formed in the early 1990s and have released six studio albums and a number of singles. The band first came to prominence in 1992 when they recorded Dinamo ja volim, a rock song which instantly became an unofficial anthem of NK Dinamo Zagreb football club supporters Bad Blue Boys.
