Amod is a town and capital of a taluka in Bharuch district, Gujarat, India. It is situated about a mile south of the Dhadhar River, some 30miles (48km) south-west of Vadodara and 24miles (38km) north of Bharuch,[1] on the NH228 road (the "Dandi heritage route") between Bharuch and Jambusar. Amod was the seat of a Thakore Sahib, who owned about 21,200 acres (86km2) of land at the start of the 20thcentury. The income of the estate was about 72,000, compared with the income of Amod municipality (established 1890) of 6,100.[1]
