SymTorrent is a free GPL-licensed open source BitTorrent client for Nokia Series 60 Symbian phones made by researchers of Budapest University of Technology and Economics. [2][3]Written in Symbian C++, rather than Open C/C++, the client is rather basic and does not support many of the features advanced clients like Torrent have. It is still able to download BitTorrent files and is supported on the Symbian S60v5 touchscreen phones (particularly Sony Ericsson Satio).[4] 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
