Kakusthavarma (435455) was a ruler of the Kadamba Dynasty of Banavasi in Southern India during the 4th century. Under his rule, the dynasty attained the height of its greatness. Talagunda and Halmidi inscriptions praise him as a formidable Kadamba warrior.[1] He was able to maintain a good relationship with the imperial Guptas.[2]
