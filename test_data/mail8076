The Cap of the North (Nordkalotten in Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, or Pohjoiskalotti in Finnish) consists of the provinces / counties Finnmark, Nordland and Troms in Norway, Norrbotten in Sweden and Lappi in Finland. This Arctic area is located around and north of the Arctic Circle in the three Nordic European countries Norway, Sweden and Finland, and the Kola Peninsula in Russia.
