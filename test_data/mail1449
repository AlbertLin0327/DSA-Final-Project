The Ulster Junior Hurling Championship is a junior "knockout" competition in the game of Hurling played in the province of Ulster in Ireland. The series of games are organised by the Ulster Council. The winners of the Ulster Junior Hurling Championship each year progress to play the other provincial champions for a chance to win the All-Ireland Junior Hurling Championship. The competition has not been played sionce 2004, as all the counties now participate in either the Christy Ring Cup or the Nicky Rackard Cup.
