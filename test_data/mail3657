The Jacks River is a 19.4-mile-long (31.2km)[1] river in the Cohutta Wilderness Area of northwest Georgia, United States. The Jacks River flows into the Conasauga River before it crosses over 411 Highway. Due to overuse, the immediate area around Jacks River Falls was closed to camping in March 2003. Other areas along the Jacks River are still open to camping, but there are now restrictions on the number of people allowed to camp per site, the distance between campsites, and others. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
