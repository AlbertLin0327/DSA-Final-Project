She is the daughter of a policeman and a social worker and was born the second of three children in a Belgian provincial town. She first came into contact with the theatrical world when she was only five when she played the role of Snow White in a local play. At school she later attended drama courses. She grew up in Lige which is in the French-speaking area of Belgium and in 2005 she was discovered by two film producers (Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne) who gave her the principal female part in their film entitled L'Enfant  The Child. This kitchen sink drama which takes place not far from Dborahs home town in the run-down industrial town of Seraing features a young couple Bruno and Sonia. The couple live off social security benefits and the proceeds of husbands robberies  he is the head of a gang of thieves. When Sonia gives birth to a child, the father cold-bloodedly sells the child to a dealer for a few thousand euros. This film was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. After her dbut as an actress she left school and plunged into her next film in Denis Dercourt's Thriller La Tourneuse de pages - The Page Turner in 2006 which brought her further acclaim. In the film she plays the cool and calculating butchers daughter Mlanie who takes her revenge on the middle classes. Years before she thought that her promising career as a pianist had been ruined by the carelessness of a famous pianist and member of a jury (played by Catherine Frot), so she now takes her revenge. Through a stroke of luck she manages to insert herself into the family unnoticed as a baby sitter and page turner. In this film Dborah mimes the part of Mlanie, which won her special acclaim from the critics and for which she was awarded a Csar in 2007. In 2009 Dborah Franois won another Csar Award for her role as Fleur in The First Day of the Rest of Your Life. In that same year she was also awarded the Romy-Schneider Prize. She lives in Paris, France, although she grew up in Lige, Belgium, attending the same high school as fellow actress Marie Gillain who features in Les Femmes de l'Ombre.
