Paul Ascher (18 December 1899  27 May 1941) was the artillery officer aboard the Panzerschiff Admiral Graf Spee during her cruise in the South Atlantic. He was later interned in Argentina in December 1939 after the scuttling of the ship, but escaped back to Germany. Paul Ascher was Fregattenkapitn aboard the Bismarck at the time of its sinking. Prior to the war, he was labeled as a Mischling, as being a "half-Jew".
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
