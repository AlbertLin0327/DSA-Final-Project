System: PII 233 or equivalent RAM: 32 MB Video Memory: 4 MB Tetris Worlds is a version of the popular video game Tetris. Originally released in 2001 for PC and the GBA, it later was released for the Xbox, GameCube, and PlayStation 2 in 2002. In 2003, an Xbox Live capable and a single-disc compilation versions (which included this game and Star Wars: The Clone Wars was released for the Xbox. The latter was bundled with Xbox systems,[1] however it is not forward compatible with the Xbox 360. The platform-specific versions of Tetris Worlds were developed by three different companies. Blue Planet Software developed the PC and PlayStation 2 versions, Radical Entertainment developed the GameCube and Xbox versions, and 3d6 Games developed the Game Boy Advance version. All versions were published by THQ. All information is quoted directly from the Xbox game manual. Gameplay consists of normal Tetris games. However, there are several game modes, tweaking the way the game works. The player can send their Mino Tetrinaut to six different worlds, where he/she plays the Tetris variant of that world. When the player plays enough of that world, more Minos are rescued. The better the player does, the more Minos rescued. They will then work to create the world into a home for Minos. This mode is where the player plays two-minute Tetris games of any variant. This is also where multiplayer games are played. The Arcade mode variants are listed as follows: While Tetris Worlds did receive some good reviews;[2] it generally received mediocre and negative reviews.[3] In the PS2, PC, and GBA versions, gameplay contained one major difference from a normal Tetris game. In classic Tetris, when a Tetrimino touches the bottom of the screen, it locks in place. However, in these versions, the Tetrimino does not lock until the player makes it lock, allowing him/her to rotate and move the piece until the player liked it the way it was. Critics said that this made the game too easy and GameSpot said that it "broke Tetris".[4] However, the GBA version features a hidden version of classic tetris (titled "Popular" tetris) that plays without this feature. It is accessed by holding the L button and pressing select on the "Marathon" game select menu. However, since it is not part of the "Default" presentation, many reviews did not factor in this mode. In the GameCube and Xbox versions, the "Easy Spin" feature was made optional. However, they still received mostly mixed reviews,[5] with the Xbox Live compatible version receiving the highest reviews.[6]
