Ginetta Sagan (June 1, 1925  August 25, 2000) was a US human rights activist best known for her work with Amnesty International on behalf of prisoners of conscience. In 1996, US President Bill Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and Italy later awarded her the rank of Grand Ufficiale Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana (Grand Official Order of Merit of the Italian Republic). Amnesty International founded an annual Ginetta Sagan Award for activists in her honor. Ginetta Sagan was born Ginetta Moroni in Milan, Italy, to a Jewish mother and Catholic father.[1] Facing rising antisemitism in Europe, her parents arranged false papers identifying her as Christian to hide her Jewish roots.[2] When World War II began, both of her parents became active in the Italian resistance movement opposing fascist rule, only to be arrested in 1943 by Mussolini's Black Brigades.[3] Her father was later shot in a staged "attempted escape", and her mother sent to Auschwitz, where she died.[1][4] Then seventeen years old, Sagan was already active in the resistance movement, delivering food coupons and clothing to hiding Jews.[3] Following her parents' disappearance, she became a courier for resistance forces in Northern Italy, as well as helping to print and distribute antigovernment pamphlets. On one occasion, she dressed as a cleaning lady to steal letterhead from government offices so that it could be used to write letters of safe passage to Switzerland.[2] Due to her energy and small size (she never grew to more than five feet tall[1]), she received the nickname Topolino ("Little Mouse").[5] In late February 1945, Sagan was betrayed by an informer in the movement, and herself arrested by the Black Brigades.[3] During her 45 days of imprisonment, she was beaten, raped, and tortured, leading up to a scheduled April 23 execution. At one point, a jailer tossed her a loaf of bread that contained a matchbox with the word corragio ("courage") written inside, a moment which would motivate much of her later work on behalf of prisoners.[5] On the day of her scheduled execution, she was being beaten by guards in a villa in Sondrio, Italy, when a pair of German officers forced her Italian captors to release her into their custody. She later recalled watching the stars from the window of their car and thinking, "I will never see another dawn." However, the Germans revealed themselves to be Nazi defectors collaborating with her resistance comrades, and they delivered Sagan safely to a Catholic hospital.[1] Sagan annually celebrated the date of April 23 for the rest of her life.[5] After Sagan recuperated, she lived in Paris for a time with her godfather, attending the Sorbonne.[4] In 1951, she emigrated to the United States of America to study child development at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where she would meet Leonard Sagan, a young medical student. The couple were married the following year, and would remain together until Leonard's death in 1997.[3] Following their marriage, the pair moved to Washington, D.C. for Leonard's work. Sagan also worked part-time teaching cooking classes to the wives of US Congressmen.[1] The couple later lived in Boston and Japan before settling in Atherton, California in 1968. Though Amnesty International had a growing reputation in the UK, the organization was still in largely unknown in the United States at this time. In 1968, only eighteen chapters of Amnesty International USA had been formed, all of them in the Eastern US. Sagan had been involved in the organization in Washington, D.C., and when she arrived in Atherton, she founded the US's 19th chapter, holding its meetings in her living room. The chapter later grew into Amnesty International USA's first West Coast regional office.[4] In 1971, Sagan organized a concert with singer Joan Baez, her neighbor and friend, in order to raise money for political prisoners in Greece; the concert drew more than 10,000 people. Sagan then began to travel throughout the American West, founding 75 more Amnesty International chapters in the next three years. By 1978, Amnesty International USA's membership had increased to 70,000, more than 100 times that of a decade before. An Amnesty International spokesman later attributed Sagan with doing more than anyone to establish Amnesty International in the US, adding that "I think she has probably organized more people than anyone else in the human rights movement globally".[1] She also founded the organization's first newsletter, Matchbox, in 1973.[1] Sagan became a figure of controversy for both right and left in the 1970s when she and Baez shifted their focus from protesting abuses by American forces in the Vietnam War to protesting the abuses of North Vietnamese reeducation camps following the war. A colleague remembers fellow anti-war activists being "furious" that Sagan would criticize the new Vietnamese government in the same terms she had criticized the US Armed Forces,[5] and Sagan later recalled accusations that she was a fascist or undercover CIA operative.[2] Over the next decade, she also advocated on behalf of prisoners in Chile, the USSR, Poland, and Greece.[1] She served on the Amnesty International USA National Board of Directors from 1983-87. In 1994, she was elected the organization's Honorary Chair of the Board.[6] In addition to her work with Amnesty International, Sagan founded the Aurora Foundation, which investigates and publicizes incidents of human rights abuses.[3] In 1987, Sagan won a Jefferson Award for Public Service in the category of "Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged".[6] In 1996, US President Bill Clinton awarded Sagan the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor of the US. In the citation, he stated that "Ginetta Sagan's name is synonymous with the fight for human rights around the world. She represents to all the triumph of the human spirit over tyranny."[7] The same year, she was awarded the Grand Ufficiale Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana, Italy's highest honor.[2][6] Amnesty International created the Ginetta Sagan Fund in 1994 in Sagan's honor. The fund grants a $10,000 annual award to a woman or women "who are working to protect the liberty and lives of women and children in areas where human rights violations are widespread".[7] Previous winners of the award include the following:
