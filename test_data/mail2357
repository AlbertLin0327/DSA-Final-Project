It peaked on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart at #5.[3] She described the meaning of the album's name, "Unbeautiful" as the title of one of her favorite songs on the album; "I called the album that because its when I hit rock bottom. Its the question a lot of people ask when theyre in a relationship, and its like where was the point where you didnt find me attractive anymore? Its a universal feeling and an unusual word. A lot of people ask me about it and relate to it. And the world is not perfect right now. "Unbeautiful" seems like a realistic title for a lot of things that are happening"
