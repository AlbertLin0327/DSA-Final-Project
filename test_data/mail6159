Mount Celeste is the unofficial name for a mountain located on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. It shares the name Celeste with two peaks in the Cariboo region of the BC Interior. Within the boundaries of Strathcona Provincial Park, this peak lies at the north end of Rees Ridge. Iceberg Peak lies at the south end of this ridge. The first ascent of this peak is credited to Jack Horbury and Jock Sutherland on August 18, 1934.
