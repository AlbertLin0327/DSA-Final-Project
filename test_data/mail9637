Voltio is the eponymous second studio album by Puerto Rican reggaeton performer Voltio, released on December 27, 2005, by Sony BMG and White Lion. Released roughly a year after his first solo album Voltage AC, Voltio charted and sold well, partly due to the successful single "Chulin Culin Chunfly", a collaboration with famous reggaeton performer Residente of Calle 13. Released in 2005, at a time that reggaeton was making a major breakthrough into the mainstream audience, the album charted wel,l peaking in the Top 20 at #17 on the United States Billboard Top Latin Albums chart and at #15 on the Top Heatseekers chart. The album was also successful enough to cross genres and to chart on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, peaking at #98.
