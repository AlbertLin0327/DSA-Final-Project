San Fernando is a 2nd class municipality in the province of Bukidnon, Philippines. According to the 2007 census, it has a population of 44,959 people. The natives of Bukidnon known as Tigwahanons and Matigsalugs were the original inhabitants of this area. They settled along the fertile river valleys of the Tigwa and Salug rivers. These people were nomadic by nature and subsisted mainly by hunting and eating forest products but they also maintained small plots of corn and root crops in places were they built their temporary shelters. They have a feudal type of government headed by a political chieftain known as Datu, who also acted as their religious leader and armed forces chief. The municipality was formerly a district of the municipalities of Maramag, Dangcagan and Valencia City pursuant to Executive Order No. 347 of Pres. Carlos P. Garcia dated July 29, 1959.

The government resettlement program for Mindanao during the 1960s and 1970s attracted immigrants from Luzon, Visayas. The arrival of the migrants, attracted by the towns rich agricultural potential, created more settlements in the area and contributed much in the development of the area.
