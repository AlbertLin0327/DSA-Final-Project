Hide 'N Seek Children's Foundation is a foundation based in Salinas, California, founded in 2002 by Executive Director Rebecca Skrdla[citation needed], a single mother of two. Hide 'N Seek Children's Foundation promotes responsible parenting by creating public awareness materials about children's emotional and financial needs. Hide 'N Seek Children's Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to making communities better places for children in single parent homes to grow up through public awareness of child support issues. Their multimedia materials make children's emotional and financial needs a priority of the community. The foundation also offers community service hours to local high school students. In June 2005, Hide 'N Seek announced that it had teamed with the White House to become a Certifying Organization for the President's Volunteer Service Award.[1] The foundation received a $10,000 grant from Harden Foundation.
