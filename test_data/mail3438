Runion Creole or Reunionese Creole (En), or Crole Runionnais in French (in Runion Creole: Krol Ryon) is a creole language spoken on Runion. It is derived mainly from French and a few terms from other languages (Malagasy, Hindi, Portuguese, Gujurati and Tamil).[2] In the recent years, some groups have tried to come up with a spelling dictionary and grammar rules but there is still no official version. Partly because of the lack of an official orthography but also because schools are taught in French, Runion Creole is rarely written. Notably, two Asterix translations into it have been published.[3] It is within the first fifty years of Reunion being inhabited that Reunionese Creole first formed.[2] Most of the people living in Reunion were either French, Malagasy or Indo-Portuguese.[2] Most families at this time had at least one first language French speaker.[4] It is now the native language of 90% of the island's population.
