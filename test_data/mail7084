Saltmarshe railway station is a railway station on the Sheffield-Hull Line between Goole and Gilberdyke stations. It serves the village of Laxton in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. The station, and all trains serving it, are operated by Northern Rail. It was opened in 1869 by the North Eastern Railway. It is named after Saltmarshe which is situated one mile south of the station on the north bank of the River Ouse. The station is served by a limited number of trains between Hull and Doncaster. Currently six trains call in each direction, mainly during the morning and evening peaks. There is no Sunday service.
