The Fiat C-platform is an automobile platform used in small family cars of the Fiat Group. The predecessor of the C-platform was the Type Three platform and the successor is the new Compact platform[1] which debuted in Alfa Romeo Giulietta in 2010. The C-platform was jointly designed by global team of Fiat engineers and small number of Lancia engineers in Fiat development center in Mirafiori, also engineers in Betim, Brazil took part of the development. This chassis uses MacPherson strut front suspension and torsion beam rear suspension. The first model to use this platform was the Fiat Stilo. Between 2007 and 2008 the C-platform was used by the new Fiat Bravo[2] and the new third generation Lancia Delta with longer wheelbase.[3] The C-platform was built in Cassino (Italy) and Betim to be used for the Brazilian versions of Stilo.
