Solidaridad is one of the ten municipalities that make up the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. It is also one of the youngest municipalities in the country and was formed on July 28 of 1993 by decree of the State Congress during the administration of Mario Villanueva Madrid. At this time the municipality of Cozumel was split into two, with the mainland section constituting the new municipality of Solidaridad. Its municipal seat is the town of Playa del Carmen. On March 13 of 2008 Solidaridad was separated from the new municipality of Tulum, as a result its land area and population was adjusted.[2] Solidaridad is home to the Maya archaeological site of Xcaret.[3] The municipality has some small but rich continental sites including the ecotourism park of Xcaret. Prior to the creation of the municipality of Tulum, the municipality was situated between latitudes 20 45' and 19 46' north and longitudes 86 57' and 88 05' west, and had an area of 4,245.67km. Today it borders the municipalities of Benito Jurez, Lzaro Crdenas to the north and Tulum to the south; and is separated in most places from its neighboring municipality to the east (Cozumel) by a stretch of the Caribbean Sea known as the Cozumel Channel. The ecotourism park of Xel-Ha and the Calica limestone quarry are not part of Solidaridad as they belong to the neighboring municipality of Cozumel. These are the only two mainland locations for the municipality of Cozumel with sizes of 90 Ha and 11.9 Ha respectively. All of the limestone from Calica is exported to the US, and the quarry has its own docks and also serves visiting cruise ships.[3] Like most of the Yucatan Peninsula, Solidaridad is almost entirely flat with a gentle slope towards the sea, so from west to east, most of the area never reaches an altitude above 25 meters above sea level . Like the rest of the peninsula's surface the land has a limestone base that does not allow the formation of surface water flows such as rivers and streams, the water instead form flows in underground rivers that sometimes rise to the surface in the cenotes. Lakes and cenotes are the major water bodies of the municipality. The municipality has a population of 159,310 according to the results of the Population and Housing Census of 2010 conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Instituto Nacional de Estadstica y Geografa), of these, 83,468 are men and 75,842 are women.[4] By this time, Tulum Municipality was already separated from Solidaridad. Currently most of its population are immigrants, mainly from the southeastern states of Mexico; but also, according to the National Institute of Migration, Mexico (Instituto Nacional de Migracin de Mxico), the municipality has 12 percent of its population of foreign origin. The largest localities (cities, towns, and villages) are:[5] The Hacienda Tres Ros is located on the Cancn-Tulum Highway Km54, near Playa del Carmen. It is a resort which was built with local materials and has implemented technologies to make the operation more environment-friendly. For example, many of the structure are built on three-meter high piles as to not interrupt the flow of water through the area. Also, garbage is recycled and cold water from deep wells is used for the cooling system. The hacienda, which is located by the sea, also has a desalinization plant to avoid using groundwater. The hotel area is surrounded by two hectares of land with 50,000 plants and surrounding that is 60 hectares of bioreserver with more than 120 species of flora and 90 species of wildlife. The hacienda has been recognized by the Mexican government as a  regional and national model of sustainable tourist development and has been recognized by the World Travel Awards. Part of the operations earning go toward studying the local ecosystems.[6]
