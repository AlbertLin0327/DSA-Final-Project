Arlene Martel (born April 14, 1936, The Bronx, New York) is an American actress and acting coach. Prior to 1964, she was frequently billed as Arline Sax, Arlene Sax, or sometimes as Tasha Martel. Martel appeared in the 1967 Star Trek: The Original Series episode "Amok Time" (as T'Pring) and the original The Outer Limits episode "Demon with a Glass Hand" (1964) written by Harlan Ellison. Martel played the princess Sarafina on Have Gun Will Travel, the evil witch "Malvina" on Bewitched, the French Underground contact "Tiger" on several episodes of Hogan's Heroes, a female cosmonaut on I Dream of Jeannie, a Hungarian immigrant "Magda" on The Fugitive episode "The Blessings of Liberty" (1966), and the woman who repeatedly utters the sinister phrase "Room for one more, honey!" at the entrance to a hospital morgue and an airplane door in the Twilight Zone episode "Twenty-Two". She also appeared in season one of Twilight Zone episode "What You Need". She was billed (as Arline Sax) as a featured actress in the episode of Route 66 called "The Newborn," in which she gives birth. She also made guest appearances on The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Untouchables, Perry Mason, Mission: Impossible, The Wild Wild West, Columbo. 1968 (movie), Angels From Hell, and two appearances on The Monkees. She received top billing when she starred as the lady commandant in charge of the Russian road crew in Zoltan, Hound of Dracula (1978), although it was only a bit part lasting less than five minutes of the 97 minute movie. She also received credit in a font so large that it was almost twice as large as that used for Reggie Nalder or Michael Pataki, the leads who occupied most of the screen throughout the movie. She appeared in the Star Trek webisode Of Gods and Men in the final scene as a Vulcan priestess initiating a marriage ceremony between Uhura and Vulcan native Stonn (a character from the episode "Amok Time", played by original actor Lawrence Montaigne). Ironically, it was Stonn who eventually won the hand of T'Pring in that episode. Martel has been married and divorced three times. Her first marriage was to Robert Palmer. Her second marriage was to actor Jerry Douglas. She has three children: Adam Palmer, Avra Douglas, and Los Angeles Times editor Jod Kaftan. She currently resides in Los Angeles, California.
