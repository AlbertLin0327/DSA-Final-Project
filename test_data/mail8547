Modern Inventions is a 1937 American animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by United Artists. The cartoon follows Donald Duck as he tours the fictional Museum of Modern Marvels. It was directed by Jack King, his first project at the Disney studio, and features original music by Oliver Wallace. The voice cast includes Clarence Nash as Donald, Billy Bletcher as the Robot Butler, and Cliff Edwards as the Robot Barber.[2] Modern Inventions is an example of retro-futurism[3] and pokes fun at modern conveniences. The scene of Donald in the barber's chair was submitted by Carl Barks as his first story contribution at Disney.[4] Donald visits the "Museum of Modern Marvels" which showcases various futuristic electronic appliances and inventions. In the museum, Donald encounters and struggles with many strange and whimsical machines, all of which seem to be against him. A running gag throughout the picture has the Robot Butler appearing to take Donald's hat away, with the words "Your hat, sir." After encountering a robotic hitch-hiker, a wrapping machine, and a fully automated baby carriage, the short ends when Donald attempts to scam a robotic barber chair and winds up getting a haircut on his behind and a shoe-shined bill. Inventions Donald interacts with include: Other inventions seen in the museum include: Throughout the cartoon, Donald pulls hats out of thin air to replace those taken by the Robot Butler (often followed by "So!"). These include:
