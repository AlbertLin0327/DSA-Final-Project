Operation Blockbuster was the completion of the larger Operation Veritable by the Canadian 1st Army, reinforced by the British XXX Corps. It took place in late February and early March, 1945. Veritable had been slower and more costly than expected and the Canadian commander, Harry Crerar, had decided on a fresh start for the operation. Three Anglo-Canadian divisions advanced north-westwards, capturing unprepared German positions in the Hochwald forested ridge, before advancing on Xanten. They linked up with the US Ninth Army at Berendonk, near Geldern on March 3.
