Philip is a given name, derived from the Greek  (Philippos, lit. "horse-loving" or "fond of horses"[1][2]), from a compound of  (phlos, "dear", "loved", "loving") and  (hippos, "horse"). In Ancient Greece, the ownership of horses was available only to those rich enough to afford them. Thus, "lover of horses" can also be understood as "noble".[citation needed] Prominent Philips who popularized the name include kings of Macedon and one of the apostles of early Christianity. Philip has many alternative spellings: Phillip, Philippe, Philipp, Phillipp, Felip, Felipe, Filip, Filippo, Filippu, Filipe, Filype, Phlyp, Phylip, Phillep, Pilib, Flp, Fulup, and has the diminutive (or hypocoristic form) Phil, Phill, Flip, Philly, Pippo or Pip.
