"Happy Hour" is a 1986 single by The Housemartins.[1] It was the third single from the album London 0 Hull 4 and reached number three in the UK Singles Chart.[2][3] The band's first big hit, it stayed on the singles chart for 13 weeks, peaking in the week of June 28, 1986.[4] The song also enjoyed exposure on United States college radio.[5] Rolling Stone noted that despite "irrepressibly giddy music hooks", the song's "sobering" lyrics "hammer away at the hypocrisy and sexism of young British business types on the move."[6] On their 1992 album, Gordon, the Barenaked Ladies paid tribute to this song by breaking into it at the end of the song "Hello City".[7]
