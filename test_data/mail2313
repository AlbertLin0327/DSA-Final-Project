From 1968 the factory began to act as a state company but with the independence of Armenia and market economic transitions the factory was in need of radical change and since 1995 it was privatized. The factory is located in Ararat region, village Avshar, Republic of Armenia. This place is known as the heart of the country, which is rich in fruitful gardens and fields famous for incomparable types of fruits, vegetables and grained pulses. The region is known to have wine treatment history even since BC, when -according to tradition- Noy came down from Ararat mountain, just where he planted the first wine field.
