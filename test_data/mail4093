Sveta Jelena (Croatian pronunciation:[sveta jelena]) is a historic medieval site in Meimurje County, northern Croatia. Originally a distinct settlement, Sveta Jelena is part of the enkovec municipality, about two kilometres away from akovec to the north. The site is well known for its Pauline monastery of Sveta Jelena (St. Helen in English) and associated facilities. Members of the Zrinski noble family were buried in a mausoleum there. From the whole monastery complex, only the Saint Helen's Chapel still exists. The monastery itself was founded by Stjepan II Lackovi (Stephen in English), Lord of Meimurje and Ban of Croatia, on August 27, 1376, and dedicated to Blessed Virgin Mary and All Saints. After Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor and the King of Croatia abolished the Paulists' provinces in his Empire on February 7, 1786, the members of the Order left Sveta Jelena. Over time, the monastery complex had to be rebuilt several times after being damaged by disasters such as fires and earthquakes. In particular, a large earthquake in 1880 nearly destroyed the building. Partial archaeological excavations have been carried out recently by the local Meimurje Museum in akovec.
