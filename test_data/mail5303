The Sugarcubes (Sykurmolarnir in Icelandic) were an Icelandic alternative rock band formed in 1986 and disbanded in 1992. They received critical and popular acclaim internationally. The members of The Sugarcubes had formerly been in a variety of Icelandic bands. Bjrk had the longest career out of any of the members - she had recorded an album as early as 11 years old, and in her late teens, she joined the Icelandic post-punk band Tappi Tikarrass, who released two albums before splitting in 1983. Drummer Siggi (Sigtryggur) Baldursson was a member of eyr, and Einar rn Benediktsson and Bragi Olafsson formed a punk band called Purrkur Pillnikk. By 1984, Bjrk, Einar rn, and Siggi had formed the supergroup KUKL with keyboardist Einar Melax, and released several singles on the independent British record label Crass. The Sugarcubes formed on June 8, 1986, with vocalist Bjrk, Bjrk's then-husband r (Thor) Eldon on guitar, and Bragi Olafsson on bass. (That same day Bjrk gave birth to her and r Eldon's son, Sindri Eldon.[1]) The band's music was characterized by a psychedelic post-punk sound sometimes reminiscent of The B-52's and Talking Heads, whimsical yet heartfelt lyrics, and the imploring, girlish voice of Bjrk, accompanied by Einar Orn's erratic vocal performances. In late 1987, the band signed to One Little Indian in the UK, Elektra Records in the US. The Sugarcubes released their debut album, Life's Too Good, in 1988, to critical acclaim in both the UK and the US. They first came to notice in the UK when radio DJ John Peel played "Birthday".[2] It became an indie hit in Britain, later voted single of the year, and a college radio hit in America. Bjrk received a great deal of praise, which began tensions between her and Einar rn. "Cold Sweat" and "Deus" were also released as singles and made the lower reaches of the UK charts, while the US single "Motorcrash" went top ten in the Modern Rock charts. By the time the group recorded its second album, r had divorced Bjrk and married Magga Ornolfsdottir, who became the group's keyboardist after Einar Melax left. Bragi divorced his wife  who happened to be the twin sister of Siggi's wife  and married Einar rn, making their union the first openly gay marriage in pop music. Their marriage later turned out to be a hoax. Here Today, Tomorrow Next Week!, the band's second album, was released in 1989. The greater vocal contribution by Einar rn on the record was criticized in many of the record's reviews, which were noticeably weaker than those for Life's Too Good. The singles "Regina" and "Planet" topped the UK indie charts but fared poorly in the mainstream charts outside of Iceland. After the release of Here Today, Tomorrow Next Week!, the band embarked on a lengthy international tour. At the conclusion of the tour in late 1990, the bandmembers pursued their own individual interests. Stick Around for Joy, the band's third album, was released in February 1992. Stick Around for Joy received better reviews than Here Today, Tomorrow Next Week!, and spawned the band's first big hit single, the aptly titled "Hit". Further singles "Walkabout" and "Vitamin" failed to make any chart impact however, and shortly after the album's release, the Sugarcubes disbanded. A collection of remixes entitled It's It was released in October 1992 along with a re-release of "Birthday" which was backed by numerous remixes of the song. The band remains friends to this day and are all still involved in the management of record label Smekkleysa (Bad Taste Ltd). On November 17, 2006, the band had a one-off reunion concert at Laugardalshll sport arena in Reykjavk, Iceland, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their debut single with all profits going to the non-profit Smekkleysa SM to promote Icelandic music.[3] They were supported by fellow Icelandic groups mm and Rass. Despite this reunion, the group has expressed that it has no intention to play future shows or record new material.
