Urine organic acids is a medical diagnostic test used to exclude the possibility that a person has an inborn error of metabolism, usually one of the organic acidemias. The usual method of analysis is tandem mass spectrometry. In most cases a random specimen of as little as 1-5 ml is enough for analysis. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
