The Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus, (also known as the LLBC) is an American political organisation composed of African Americans elected to the Louisiana Legislature. The primary purpose of the LLBC is to raise the quality of life for African Americans, the indigent and working people through legislation, education and economic development. To fulfill these priorities the following goals were set by the LLBC: Officers are elected from within the Caucus with equal representation from both the House and Senate members.[1] The LLBC was established in 1977. The ten founders of LLBC were Rev. Avery C. Alexander, Diana E. Bajoie, Sidney Barthelemy, Louis Charbonnet, III, Nick Connor, Joseph A. Delpit, Alphonse Jackson, Johnny Jackson, Jr., Thomas Jasper, and Richard Turnley, Jr. The number of African-American legislators has increased tremendously since the inception of the LLBC. Currently the Louisiana Legislature has thirty-two (32) African-American members consisting of nine (9) senators and twenty-two (23) representatives.
