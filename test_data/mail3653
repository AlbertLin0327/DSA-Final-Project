The Pas (play/p/; French: Le Pas) is a town in Manitoba, Canada, located in Division No. 21, Manitoba in the Northern Region, some 630 kilometres northwest of the provincial capital, Winnipeg, near the border of Saskatchewan. It is sometimes still called Paskoyac by locals as the first trading post was called Fort Paskoyac. The Pasquia River which begins in the Pasquia Hills in east central Saskatchewan runs into the Saskatchewan River at this point. The French in the 1795 knew the river as Basquiau. Known as "The Gateway to the North", The Pas is a multi-industry northern Manitoba town serving a district population of over 15,000 (including the Opaskwayak Cree Nation). The main components of the region's economy are agriculture, forestry, commercial fishing, tourism, transportation, and services (especially health and education). The main employer is a paper and lumber mill operated by Tolko Industries. The Pas contains one of the two main campuses of the University College of the North. The Pas is bordered by the Rural Municipality of Kelsey, as well as part of the Opaskwayak Cree Nation. The area's original inhabitants were the Cree. They are thought to have migrated from the southeastern prairies over 9000 years ago[citation needed]. The first European recorded to encounter the Cree here was Henry Kelsey, an employee of the Hudson's Bay Company. He travelled through the area between 1690 and 1692 on his way to the Canadian prairies. During the years of New France, La Vrendrye, the first western military commander, directed the construction of Fort Pascoyac near here. It was named after the people of the Pasquia River. For years the settlement was called Pascoyac, sometimes shortened to Le Pas. The Pas Indian Band's reserve lands around the site of the Hudson Bay trading post and the Anglican Church Mission were surrendered in the first decade of the 20th century to make way for the railroad and development of the Town of The Pas which was incorporated in 1912. The Pas Indian Band was relocated to the north side of the Saskatchewan River and changed its name to Opaskwayak Cree Nation. The area today is composed of three distinct communities: The Town of The Pas, the Opaskwayak Cree Nation, and the Rural Municipality of Kelsey. The history of the city and the region may be seen at the Sam Waller Museum, located in the old courthouse in downtown The Pas. The Pas is governed by a mayor and six councillors, who are elected by residents. The mayor is Alan McLauchlan. The region is represented in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as part of The Pas riding. The riding was held by New Democratic MLA Oscar Lathlin until his death in November 2008. In the House of Commons of Canada, The Pas is part of the Churchill riding, held by NDP MP Niki Ashton. The people of The Pas enjoy watching ice hockey. The OCN Blizzard is owned by the Opaskwayak Cree Nation. The team competes in the Manitoba Junior Hockey League. The Pas is also home to the Huskies minor hockey league and the MBCI Spartans who compete in Zone 11 of the MHSAA. The Pas's public school system is the Kelsey School Division, which consists of two elementary schools (Kelsey Elementary and Opasquia School), One middle schools (Scott Bateman Middle School), One Adult learning centre (Mary Duncan) and one high school (Margaret Barbour Collegiate Institute) There is also a K-12 school located on the Opaskwayak Cree Nation. The town hosts one of the two main campuses of the University College of the North. CBWIT first went on the air in June, 1962 as CBWBT-1. The station broadcast kinescope recordings sent to the transmitter from CBWT. On March 1, 1969, the province-wide microwave system replaced the kinescope recordings, and The Pas has enjoyed live television since then.[2] All stations serving The Pas are repeaters of Winnipeg-based stations. Shaw Communications is the local cable television provider serving The Pas, and operates the local Shaw TV channel on cable channel 11. The Pas experiences a humid continental climate (Kppen Dfb) that just barely escapes being classified as a subarctic climate (Kppen Dfc).
