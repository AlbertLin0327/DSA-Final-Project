JW Marriott Las Vegas Resort and Spa is a luxury hotel in Summerlin, Nevada, near Las Vegas. The 50-acre (20ha) resort was designed using a Tuscan/Tropical theme. Golf was a component of the project from the start as it acquired tee times at the adjacent Tournament Players Club course with direct access from the resort. The hotel and spa is operated by JW Marriott, while the Rampart Casino on the same property is operated by Cannery Casino Resorts. The Resort at Summerlin made its debut in June 1999. It was described as Las Vegas' first off-Strip luxury resort, according to its developers. The property had 54 acres (22ha) and included a 40,000sqft (3,700m2) spa, 11 acres (4.5ha) of private gardens and pools, and the Regent Grand Palms and Regent Grand Spa hotels. The two hotels combined offer 541 guest rooms and suites. Guests were given access to preferred tee times on seven courses at five area golf facilities.[1] The Resort at Summerlin was managed by Las Vegas-based Seven Circle Resorts, a wholly owned subsidiary of Swiss Casinos of America, the majority owner of the resort. The hotels were operated under license from Regent International Hotels of Minneapolis. Swiss Casinos[2] had built successful luxury casinos as St. Gallen Switzerland and in South Africa. They spent over $270 million to create an exclusive resort with the goal of earning a 5 diamond rating from AAA. In only a little more than two years the property was purchased in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court auction for $80 million by Vancouver-based Hotspur Resorts. Hotspur brought in Marriott to operate the hotel. The casino was leased to Nevada-licensed Millennium Management on a 10-year lease, and renamed the Rampart Casino at the Resort at Summerlin. The hotel rooms have a minimum of 560 square feet (52 m) of space. The 40,000 square foot (4,000 m) spa offers many services and includes a 65,000 square foot (6,000 m) convention center.
