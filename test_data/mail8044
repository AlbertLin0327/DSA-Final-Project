2wo was an English industrial metal band, formed by former Judas Priest lead singer Rob Halford as a side project, after the break-up of his first solo project, Fight. Halford and guitarist John Lowery aka John 5 formed the group in 1996, and were signed to Trent Reznor's Nothing Records label. Reznor produced their sole output, Voyeurs, which sold poorly. Halford disbanded the group two years later. Halford has recently expressed interest in releasing the early demos from Voyeurs, which he has described as "tougher and edgier" compared to the final album.[1] Halford hired porn director Chi Chi Larue to direct the video for the first single, "I Am a Pig".[2] This video featured grainy S&M scenes of the band and various porn stars, including a few brief glimpses of Janine Lindemulder, in a sex dungeon. It also incorporates some of the album's artwork into the concept. It was not widely shown because of its content, but was not banned.
