Arikara is a Caddoan language spoken by the Arikara people, who reside primarily at Fort Berthold reservation in North Dakota. Arikara is very close to the Pawnee language, but they are not mutually intelligible. Arikara is now spoken in North Dakota by a very few elders. One of the last fluent speakers, Maude Starr, died on January 20, 2010.[1] She was a certified language teacher who participated in Arikara language education programs.[2] Language revitalization efforts are continuing. Arikara is extensively documented, with several volumes of interlinear texts of Arikara stories,[3] a learner's introductory text,[4] and linguistic studies.[5]
