St. Norbert College (SNC) is a private Catholic liberal arts college in De Pere, Wisconsin. Founded in October 1898 by Abbot Bernard Pennings, a Norbertine priest and educator, the school was named after Saint Norbert of Xanten. In 1962, the college became coeducational and today enrolls about 2,175 students. St. Norbert College was established when Abbot Bernard Pennings, a Dutch immigrant priest from the Premonstratensian abbey of Bern (Netherlands), founded the college to train young men for the priesthood. Frances I. Van Dyke, a seminarian, was the first and, at the time, the only student. St. Norbert is the first and only institution of higher learning in the world sponsored by the Premonstratensian order. Abbot Pennings later started a commerce program at the college for lay students before retiring in 1955. St. Norbert's second president, Father Dennis Burke, expanded the college, anticipating the student population would eventually reach 2000. Dr. Robert Christin, who became president in 1968, implemented the current course system and the academic divisional structure. In 1973, Neil Webb, a former faculty member and vice president, became president. With his strong fiscal management abilities, Dr. Webb established the first substantial permanent endowment for the school. Serving as the college's president from 1983 to 2000, Thomas Manion brought national recognition to the institution and led the expansion of facilities and the development of additional academic programs. Under his leadership, the enrollment topped 2000, and extensive renovations and construction activities expanded the college's physical facilities. Mr. Thomas Kunkel, former Dean of the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park, became the seventh president of the college on July 1, 2008. St. Norbert College offers undergraduate programs in more than 40 areas of study, leading to a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Business Administration degree. A Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree is also offered through a joint effort with the Bellin College of Nursing. The most popular undergraduate majors are Business Administration (22%), Education (18%), and Communication (12%).[1] In addition to its undergraduate offerings, St. Norbert College offers three masters-level graduate programs in education, theological studies, and liberal studies. The Master of Theological Studies department hosts a branch program in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Program studies take place on the Norbertine Community grounds in Albuquerque. Students on that campus can earn the full MTS degree. St. Norbert College has a student-to-faculty ratio of 14:1 and an average class size 22. Regardless of their major, students enrolled at St. Norbert College complete a 12-course (48 credit) General Education Program that emphasizes writing and the liberal arts. The school places an emphasis on its honors program, student-faculty collaborative research (as early as freshman and sophomore years), professional internships and study abroad.[citation needed] Over the past 15 years, St. Norbert has been ranked as one of the top five comprehensive (bachelor's-level) colleges in the Midwest, by U.S.News & World Report.[2] In 2008, St. Norbert moved into the national liberal arts colleges category and is now ranked 127th of the 264 schools in the nationwide category.[3] The college is also listed among the "best in the Midwest" by Princeton Review,[4] and is ranked 84th of out 600 by Forbes on their list of America's Best Colleges.[5] The campus consists of 93 acres (38ha), much of which borders the Fox River. Students typically walk to classes, even in the winter. The many trees and statues on campus provide a scenic view, especially in Fall, when the foliage changes colors. Directly behind the Campus Center is a pavilion and docks where St. Norbert hosts its fall Back to School Festival, a kick off to the new school year, with fireworks, a picnic, and live entertainment on the Fox River waterfront. Gries Hall was recently added to SNC campus, as well as a new library. Important social buildings include the Ray Van Den Heuvel Family Campus Center (Campus Center), which includes a fitness center, gymnasium, and diner (Phils Diner) and a reading lounge with a picturesque view overlooking the Fox River. There is also an events hall for movies and public speakers. Special events put on by student groups are also held there, such as comedian appearances and awareness speeches. The Baer mall, in front of Main Hall, is another scenic location. More than 74% of students live on campus in residence halls, apartments and townhouses. St. Norbert requires all traditional undergraduate students not registered as commuters to live on-campus to strengthen the bond of community. A limited number of seniors are released to live off-campus in recent years, though the administration has made it clear that this is an exception, not the rule. Typically only seniors find off-campus housing, which is still within blocks of campus. Freshman housing includes four traditional residence hall options: Madelaine-Lorraine Hall (co-ed), Sensenbrenner Hall (women-only), Bergstrom Hall (co-ed), and Burke Hall (co-ed). Campus housing options for sophomore and juniors include Mary Minahan McCormick Hall, Michels Hall, and Victor McCormick Hall. Upperclassmen enjoy the "Townhouses" (apartment-like housing), College-owned houses, and College-owned apartments. There are more than 67 registered student clubs and organizations on campus. More than half of students participate in one of these groups,[citation needed] making student involvement an important aspect of campus life. St. Norbert encourages its students to become involved in their community through community service, and also by participating in one of the 16 fraternities, sororities, and independent social groups. The school also has 10 National Honor Society chapters, two student publications, and eight musical and performance ensembles. A major activity for St. Norbert students participate in is the annual "Into The Streets" community service project that provides service to organizations in De Pere and neighboring cities. This event is staffed by first year students and is part of the FYE program. The Student Government Association (SGA) vision is to serve as the relevant, representative voice of the student body before the wider community within and outside of St. Norbert College. The Student Government Association is split into three governing bodies: 1) Executive Board, 2) Student Assembly and 3) Committee Representatives. The entire organization holds in excess of fifty representative positions. The student representatives serve as a link between students and the administration to serve the interests of the student body. Greek life at St. Norbert includes four sororities and four fraternities, as well as two Greek governing groups. Greek groups sponsor fund-raising activities, food drives, and benefits to support charities. Greek groups collectively completed a total of 1,385 hours of service during the 2006-2007 school year.[6]  Alpha Delta Gamma recently reactivated in the '09-'10 school year, and will celebrate its rechartering in the Fall 2010 semester.[dated info] At only six members large, ADG used to be the largest fraternity on campus.

Created in 2006, the Wheel Chair Bowl is a game of football played on a basketball court with wheel chairs. This event, put on exclusively by the St. Norbert chapter of Delta Upsilon, has received local media attention.[7]  The Phi Delta Theta St. Norbert chapter contains around 30 members.[6] Members participate in many campus-wide causes, with the chapter dedicated to the ALS Association as its international philanthropy.

Delta Phi Epsilon International Sorority, founded in 1917, is a sorority dedicated to diversity, known as one of the first sororities not to discriminate based on ethnicity, race, or creed.  Kappa Beta Gamma helps with multiple causes, including the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Relay for Life, and Red Cross blood drives. For the last six years KBG has hosted a benefit to raise money for the National MS Society. A Theta Phi Alpha This group is the oldest sorority on campus founded in 1954. It is active in philanthropies, including serving at the House of Hope in Green Bay.
