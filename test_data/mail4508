Aspotogan is a small fishing community in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, located in the Chester Municipal District on the Aspotogan Peninsula. Aspotogan is at the head of Aspotogan Harbor, which gets its name from the Mi'kmaq Ashmutogun or Ukpudeskakun meaning "block the passage way" or "where the seals go in and out"[1]. Aspotogan is on the Lighthouse Route (Nova Scotia Route 329). There is a public wharf in Aspotogan Harbor.
