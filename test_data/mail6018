Aim and Ignite is the first album from the indie pop band Fun. It was released on August 25, 2009, through Nettwerk.[9] The two bonus tracks are re-imagined versions of two other songs on the CD.[10] The title of the album comes from the track "Light a Roman Candle with Me". All songs written by Nate Ruess, Andrew Dost, Jack Antonoff and Sam Means except as indicated.[11] iTunes Bonus tracks: Aim and Ignite was released to positive reviews. AbsolutePunk.net's Drew Beringer praised the album, calling it "what a pop album should sound like" and "the most essential pop album of 2009".[1] Allmusic called the album "progressive, but in the best possible way" and admired Ruess's lyrics for purple penguins "investigating the larger truths of life...with a witty approach that keeps the songs bubbling merrily along on a positive note".[2] Dave de Sylvia of Sputnikmusic wrote, "Aim and Ignite isnt the most consistent pop album around," but he ultimately commended the album as "a superbly mixed and arranged album made by musicians who clearly understand the limits and potential of pop music".[8] Estella Hung of PopMatters was less impressed with the album, praising songs "Be Calm" and "The Gambler", but criticizing the lyrics and production of the album's early tracks. Hung concluded that while Aim and Ignite is "pretty original to say the least", it "fails to live up to the Formats last outing".[5] Popdose's Ken Shane called the album "an interesting and unusual listen". Shane applauded the album's songwriting and said "many of the songs are really good", but he objected to the "cute" production, desiring to hear the band "in a more stripped-down form. He ended his review with: "I have a similar problem with Dr. Dog, a band that was recommended to me by a number of people. I think much of their recorded work is too fussed over, but when I saw them live and their sound was more stripped down out of necessity, emphasizing their powerful songwriting, I thought they were wonderful. Perhaps the same fate awaits me with Fun."[12] The album reached number 26 on Sputnikmusic's top 50 albums of 2009.
