Mark Fiora (born May 16, 1962 in Mount Barker, South Australia) is a former Australian international Motorcycle speedway rider. He is a four time South Australian Champion and rode for 13 different teams in the United Kingdom between 1981 and 1988. "Felix" Fiora, as he was known, was one of the earliest graduates of Adelaide's Under-16 Sidewinders Speedway and started his senior racing career on South Australia's speedway's Rowley Park (Adelaide) and Riverview (Murray Bridge) and was seen by many as a possible successor to John Boulger as South Australia's best rider. Mark Fiora impressed in his early years and his experience in the UK during 1981 and 1982 finally saw his potential tapped when he won the 1983 South Australian Championship at Speedway Park. He made it two in a row in 1984 at the North Arm Speedway in Adelaide and made it a hat trick of state title wins when he won again in 1985 at the Riverview Speedway. After finishing second to former World (European) Under-21 Champion Steve Baker in 1986, Fiora made it four wins in five years when he won his last SA title in 1987 at the Westline Speedway in Whyalla. Fiora would finish second to Craig Hodgson in 1988 and he finished second again the Hodgson in 1989 at North Arm. As South Australian Champion or runner-up, Fiora gained automatic qualification to the Australian Championship but he failed to place in any Australian final. Mark Fiora's best result at the Australian titles was winning the Best Pairs Championship in 1988 at Murray Bridge with Craig Hodgson. Following the 1989/90 season, Mark Fiora at the age of 28, retired from competitive riding. Mark Fiora first raced in the British leagues in 1981 and he rode for 13 different sides until retiring from riding in Britain after 1988.
