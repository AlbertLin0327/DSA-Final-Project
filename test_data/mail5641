The Campaspe River is a river in Victoria, Australia. It was named by Major Mitchell in 1836 for Campaspe, a mistress of Alexander the Great.[1] The river was known as yalooka by the local aboriginal people of the Rochester area.[2] From its source in the foothills of the Great Dividing Range, the river flows north and joins the Murray River. The Campaspe River begins in the Wombat State Forest northwest of Bullengarook and southwest of Macedon, near Ashbourne and Firth Park, a local camping ground and historical area. The river then flows west of the township of Woodend and then through the town of Kyneton. The Calder Freeway crosses the river tree times near Kyneton. The middle reaches of the river are dominated by Lake Eppalock, a constructed reservoir. The Coliban River, the most significant tributary of the Campaspe, also flows into Lake Eppalock. Towns located on the river in this area include Redesdale located just above Eppalock and Axedale, located just below Eppalock, where the McIvor Highway crosses the river. The towns of Elmore and Rochester lie on the river's lower reaches. The Midland Highway and the Northern Highway cross the river at Elmore. The river meets the Murray River near the town of Echuca. After European settlement, native vegetation was removed from part of the area[citation needed], which was replanted with willow trees and hedgerows of hawthorn bushes, some of the latter remaining today. Over a number of years the willow growth has been progressively cleared and eradicated by local groups of volunteers. The willow-free parts of the river have been subsequently replanted with indigenous species. Walking routes and cycle tracks have been installed along one bank of the river, creating a sustainable leisure resource for the town. Aborigines lived in the catchment for millennia. Europeans arrived in the upper catchment area in 1834. Coordinates: 364527S 144318E / 36.7575S 144.51889E / -36.7575; 144.51889
