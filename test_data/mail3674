Baclaran LRT Station is a station on the Manila LRT Yellow Line (LRT-1). The station is located right near the border of Pasay City with Baclaran, Paraaque City at the southern end of Taft Avenue and, like all other stations on the LRT-1, Baclaran is above-ground on viaduct. The station is named after the famous shopping district of the same name, Baclaran. Being one of four major stops in LRT-1, it is called Baclaran Terminal. Baclaran is one of the four LRT stations serving Pasay City, the others are Gil Puyat, Libertad and EDSA. It is the southern terminus of the LRT-1, where trains from Roosevelt terminate. The line's depot, where its trains are stored, maintained and cleaned, is located near the terminal. The terminal is near one of the country's most famous landmarks, the Baclaran Shrine, home of Our Mother of Perpetual Help. It is also near to the numerous dry goods and flea markets (tiangges), selling everything from clothes and electronics to home decorations and traditional medicine. Baclaran Terminal is a major transportation hub, with many buses and jeepneys terminating here. Buses coming from the terminal usually head to points south of Manila and the province of Cavite. Jeepneys that terminate here usually head to various destinations in Metro Manila (Las Pinas City, Paranaque City, and Muntinlupa City to the south; City of Manila, Pasay City, Quezon City, and Caloocan City to the north), and the province of Cavite. Taxis also ply for hire near the station, with dedicated taxis available for passengers headng to the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, which is only about two (2) kilometers from the station. Cycle rickshaws can also be used to navigate the interior streets of Baclaran from the station. The station is set to be the transfer point for the Yellow Line extension, also known as the LRT-6, which is currently at the proposal stage. If and when the extension is realized, the line is set to extend all the way to Bacoor in Cavite, with the first station south of Baclaran being Redemptorist.
