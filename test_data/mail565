Harry Travis Summersgill, M.D., (1876  June 16, 1931) was an American physician and college football and baseball coach. He served as the head football coach of Tulane University from 1900 to 1901 and the head baseball coach in 1902. A native of Vermont,[1] Summersgill originally attended Brown University, where he played on the football team in 1896,[2] but transferred to the University of Virginia in 1898.[3] He played football at Virginia as an end from 1898 to 1899,[4][5] and was elected the team captain for the 1899 season.[6] He was a member of Beta Theta Pi.[7] Summersgill then attended medical school at Tulane University. He took over as the part-time head football coach from H. T. "Pop" Collier for the 1900 season.[8][9] In his first season, Tulane finished undefeated and unscored upon with a perfect 50 record, which was an impressive turnaround from a scoreless 061 campaign the year prior.[10] The team outscored the Southern Athletic Club, Alabama, Millsaps, Louisiana State, and Mississippi by a combined 1050 margin.[10] The next year, Tulane finished 1901 with a 42 mark.[11] Against the Mobile Y.M.C.A., Tulane lost, 20, despite Summersgill's protests to the officials that there was still time remaining in the game.[10] The Olive and Blue later beat Louisiana State, 220, on the field, but was forced to forfeit 110 by the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association over the use of a professional player.[10] Today, Tulane records still count this as a win, which Louisiana State records dispute.[10][12] Summersgill received a Doctor of Medicine degree from Tulane in 1900.[3] In May 1901, he was licensed after passing the medical examination at Tulane.[13] In 1902, Summersgill coached the Tulane baseball team and amassed an 85 record.[14] In 1905, he was the medical officer in charge at the Bohio Hospital in the Canal Zone at Bohio, Panama.[3] He served as superintendent of the City Hospital in Cincinnati,[15] and later, as the head of the University of California Hospital in San Francisco.[15] After a ten-week illness, he died on June 16, 1931 of a cerebral hemorrhage at the Jamaica Hospital in Queens, New York.[15]
