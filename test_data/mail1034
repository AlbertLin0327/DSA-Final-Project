Collingwood (1950-1960) 180 games, 148 goals Thorold Merrett (born 30 September 1933) is a former Australian rules footballer, who played in the Victorian Football League, (VFL). From Victorian town Cobden, Merrett was a small sized footballer who was a keen Richmond fan who wanted to play league football for his beloved side. At 16 years of age, Merrett was rejected by legend Jack Dyer with his light frame the problem, but he was given another opportunity at Victoria Park, where he stood out in a set of practice games for Collingwood just before the 1950 season. It was initially thought by followers and players that he would be 'killed' because of his size (168cm, 59kg). He made his debut in 1950 for the black and white and his main asset, his left foot, would open a door of success. At the age of 16 he was one of the youngest players to debut in VFL. Merrett played as a wingman and established a great amount of respect as his lethal kick (which was mastered in unique fashion, as he practised at his farm as a kid kicking stab passes through a tyre swing) made him one of the best players in the competition, and to add to that, his small stature made it unbelievable to see his success as a league footballer. In 1952, Merrett polled his way to equal sixth in the Brownlow Medal, All-Australian selection and a top three finish in the Copeland Trophy. A year later he finished in the top 10 once more in the Brownlow Medal and celebrated the 1953 premiership with the Magpies. Merrett was named in the best in the Grand Final. In years that followed, Merrett performed consistently and he continued to be regarded as one of the best kicks in the league, as well as one of the best wingmen. He played in two more losing Grand Finals in 1955-56 (he also played in the 1952 losing side). In 1958, Merrett changed roles to become a rover, and it succeeded. He won the Best and Fairest. It was a special win because the Pies also won the 1958 flag, with Merrett being named best on ground. In 1959, Merrett again starred as a rover, winning a second consecutive Best and Fairest, and finished in the top 10 in the Brownlow Medal for a third time in his career (he ended up with 77 career Brownlow votes). A second broken leg in 1960 saw Merrett miss most of the season and, aged 26, he retired prematurely, feeling his best football was past. Merrett played 180 games in 11 seasons and kicked 148 goals. He was also a dual Best and Fairest and premiership player, All-Australian, and Victorian representative on seven occasions. In 1997 he was included in the Collingwood Football Club Hall of Fame and Team of the Century, on the wing.
