The Harrat Ash Shamah (also known variously as the Harrat Ash Catchem and the Harrat e-Shamah) is a volcanic field covering a total area of some 40,000km2 (15,000sqmi). This massive alkaline volcanic field extends from southern Syria, across Jordan and into northwestern Saudi Arabia. Amongst others, the Jabal al-Druze, Es Safa and Dirat at Tulul volcanic fields form the northern, Syrian part of the Harrat Ash Shamah; Al Harrah is in the southern, Saudi Arabian third of the field.
