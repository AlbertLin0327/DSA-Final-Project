Steri-Spray featured on Series Five, Episode 6 of the BBC Two programme Dragons' Den. Ian Helmore of Steri-Spray presented a range of showers designed to combat a range of bacterial diseases including Legionnaires disease and MRSA. The invention uses low voltage ultraviolet technology to remove water-borne bacteria from the shower head and kill bacteria in the incoming supply water. Two of the Dragons, Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis, invested a total of 145,000 in the business.
