Pheneridine is not currently used in medicine. Presumably it has similar effects to other opioid derivatives, such as analgesia, sedation, nausea and respiratory depression, however unlike most opioid derivatives it is not specifically listed as an illegal drug, although it would probably be regarded as a controlled substance analogue of pethidine on the grounds of its related chemical structure in some jurisdictions such as the USA, Canada and Australia, and would be classified as a "Pethidine Analogue" under the New Zealand Misuse of Drugs Act Class C7.  
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
