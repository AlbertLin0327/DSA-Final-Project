Beryl Hallam Augustine Tennyson (10 December 1920, Chelsea, London  21 December 2005, Highgate) was a British radio producer. He was the son of Charles Tennyson and Ivy Pretious, and the great-grandson of the Poet Laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson. He was educated at Eton College and Oxford University.[1] He married Margot Wallach in the autumn of 1945 in Kensington, London: they married in 1946.[1] She was born 30 March 1921 in Moenchengladbach, Germany, and died 19 April 1999 in Highgate, London. He was homosexual, a fact known to his wife at the time they married. He was convinced by a therapist that his homosexuality would be cured if he married a woman. He and his wife Margot nevertheless had satisfactory sexual relations, and they had a son and a daughter. He was stabbed to death in his bed in 2005.[2] Hallam joined the BBC World Service in 1956, working as a radio producer and becoming assistant head of drama.[1]
