Cornucopia is a ghost town of the gold mining boom of the 1880s in Eastern Oregon, United States. The name of the town was chosen since it meant "Horn of Plenty".[1] Gold was discovered in Cornucopia in 1884. The town was platted in 1886.[2] It is located east of Baker City high in the mountains of Pine Valley almost due north of Halfway, Oregon, on Oregon Route 86. Coordinates: 450030N 1171134W / 45.008214N 117.1926751W / 45.008214; -117.1926751
