Gilberte H. Dallas (1918 - 1960), real name Gilberte Herschtel, was a French poet. Her mother died when Gilberte was seven months old; her father, a Parisienne jeweller, died of tuberculosis when she was twelve. This loss had a big impact on her. At the age of ten she set sail to the open sea in a small boat, trying to find her mother in the infinity [1] and nearly died. Apart from writing, she was a painter too, but her paintings were lost by an art trader. She spent the Second World War in Switzerland with her fiance, but after he left her, she was interned. She worked as an actress in Nice and Monaco. After the war, she travelled a lot, e. g. through Oceania. She died of cancer. She is considered one of the most important potes maudits of post-war France.
