The Minnesota Monsters was an indoor football team that played in the Professional Indoor Football League (PIFL) in 1998. The Monsters franchise was owned by Robert and Joann Edwards. The team office was based in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, and played their games at Warner Coliseum on the Minnesota State Fairgrounds. The team colors were: Blue, Black, and White/Gold. The Monsters were coached by Ron Simmons for the few PIFL games they did participate in. The Monsters played two preseason PIFL games in '98. Both were victories at home: Minnesota's first three PIFL regular season games were losses. Then, the Monsters forfeited a home game scheduled against the Colorado Wildcats on May 16, 1998. The following weekend, on May 22, 1998, a road trip game at the Honolulu Hurricanes was on the schedule. Due to a shipping error, the Monsters had to play the first half of the game wearing the Hurricanes' road uniforms. Minnesota actually got their lone regular season victory in that game. The victory was taken away by the league president for unpaid bills. The team was officially folded on May 28, 1998. After forfeiting another home game the following weekend against the Utah Catzz, The Monsters lost to Madison 20-36. The league ruled this game as an "exhibition game" for the standing purposes. From that point on, all remaining Minnesota Monsters games were ruled to be forfeits.  Exhibition Game  victory was taken away by the league president for unpaid bills
