Money Key is a small island in the lower Florida Keys. It is located in the Atlantic Ocean between Little Duck Key and the Molasses Keys. U.S. 1 (or the Overseas Highway) passes the key at approximately mile marker 42, about 800 ft south of the Seven Mile Bridge. There is no road access to the island. A July 27, 1969 article in the Key West Citizen by E.R. Adams states that the key received its name because pirate loot was found there.[1] The island has a small beach, several coconut trees and is frequented by boaters and campers. Coordinates: 244101N 811256W / 24.683482N -81.215454E / 24.683482; -81.215454
