Established in August 2003, Highbury Korfball Club (HKC) is based in North London, England and is a member of the England Korfball Association.[1] Highbury Korfball Club succeeded Arsenal Korfball Club, which was established by Hugh Barker in 1998. Rebranding occurred to avoid unwanted attention from curious football fans. With four teams, HKC competes across a range from highly competitive to highly social indoor korfball leagues, generally in the London area during the winter months. During the summer, Highbury competes at many standards in many tournaments held over weekends throughout the UK, Holland, Luxembourg and Hungary. The summer tournaments are often but not always played outdoors. The club has been established in the London League for many years. In the season of 2006-2007, Highbury expanded to become a 2 team club including 4 Australian's who did Highbury and Australia proud as they participated in the Commonwealth & Friends Korfball Tournament that was held in Croydon during the summer of 2006. In the season of 2006-2007, Highbury expanded to become a 3 team club. To ensure the quality rose with the quantity, Highbury travelled to Holland once again to compete in an outdoor tournament but this time took in a couple of extra days to participate in a training camp run for Highbury's benefit by Mart Huijbregts. Highbury looked internally to strengthen its coaching staff base and subsidised that attendance of two of its members to the annual Avon Tyrell Level 2 Coaching Qualification course. In the season of 2008-2009, Highbury expanded to become a 4 team club. This was the year that the EKA disbanded the National Reserve and National Division 1 Leagues and introduced a new Regional League structure. Highbury took their place in the new structure by competing in the newly formed South East Regional League. For the first time, Highbury brought in an external full time coach to train the elite squad; Tamara Burnell, a National Premiere League player with Bec KC[2] and Scottish representative was given the job which also included training the players of Highbury 2 which competed in the London 1st Division. Highbury 3 swept aside most opposition in the London 3rd division only losing two games, both by a single goal but a scheduling technicality lead to a game being forfeited and the title slipping from their grasp. There could be no hard feelings though as the eventual winners of the league, Supernova 2, were the only team not to suffer defeat at the hands of Highbury 3 with the head-to-head battles resulting in a draw and a single goal win to Supernova.[3] During the 2009-2010 season Highbury welcomed the news that London would form their own Region due to the restructuring of Regional Leagues. Pre-season Highbury were looking for a new head coach and Laurie Swan, head coach on Supernova KC, stepped in to assist the club with player selection during the month running up to the season start while a coach was sought. Before the season was under way, Stuart Ironmonger, a National Premier League player and coach with a successful history took the role of head coach. Highbury played in the London Regional League (LRL) and was represented with a team in each of Divisions 2, 3 and 4 of the London Korfball Association (LKA). Highbury put in many good performances and clinched a proud second place in the LRL behind winners Bec 2. Thus, achieving their goal of beating Croydon KC[4] in to the single position awarded to the LRL in the annual Champions Trophy[5] (Bec 2 were ineligible as Bec were already playing in the National League). While Highbury didn't win promotion into the National League they did show throughout the Champions Trophy that they could compete with the teams that were being promoted in to the top league in the country. Meanwhile in the LKA, Highbury 4 were regularly requiring to field two players from the higher leagues to form a complete and legal team. While this was completely within the rules of the LKA, the LKA committee decided to withdraw Highbury 4 from their league without notice. Andrew Speck was elected chair. The club maintained 3 teams although there was an exodous of men from the regional league team as they moved out of London for employment opportunities.
