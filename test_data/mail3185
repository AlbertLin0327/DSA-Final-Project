Induku Zethu is an album by the South African isicathamiya group Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The album (#BL 393) featured the group on the front cover photograph wearing traditional Zulu attire, with lead singer and founder Joseph Shabalala out front brandishing a spear (the album's title translated into English is "Our Fighting Sticks"). The album was released in 1983, and reissued internationally (one of many early Mambazo albums) in 1987 by Shanachie Records.
