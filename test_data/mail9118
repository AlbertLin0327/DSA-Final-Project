Content:
neXtProt is an on-line knowledge platform on human proteins. It strives to be a comprehensive resource that provides a variety of types of information on human proteins, such as their function, subcellular location, expression, interactions and role in diseases. Currently, the major part of the information in neXtProt[1] is obtained from the UniProt Swiss-Prot database but is gradually being complemented by data originating from high-throughput studies. It is developed jointly by the CALIPHO group[2] directed by Amos Bairoch and Lydie Lane of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) and by GeneBio SA.
