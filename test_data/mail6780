Dangerously Excited {  Naneun Kongmoowonida lit. "I am a Civil Servant") is a 2012 South Korean comedy-drama about a stuffy municipal bureaucrat who learns to embrace life when a budding rock band moves into his basement. The film premiered at the 2011 Busan International Film Festival and also screened at the 2012 Udine Far East Film Festival.[1][2] Han Dae-hee (Yoon Je-moon) is a low level city government employee in the Mapo district of Seoul. His department handles various issues like trash, noise, and public safety. Dae-hee isn't married, nor does he have a girlfriend at the moment. He also doesn't have many hobbies. Dae-hee enjoys memorizing facts from books to impress his colleagues and watching television until falling asleep. You can say he is conservative and his job at the city government office suits him well. Within the Mapo district lies the Hongdae area famous for the thriving indie rock music scene. Dae-hee leaves with a co-worker to talk with a band who has received numerous complaints from neighbors about loud noise in a residential neighborhood. The band is practicing for their next album which is coming out in the upcoming days. They are disheartened when Dae-hee and his co-worker informs them they have to stop playing in their rented basement. During their talk, a man comes by and offers the band to rent his attic room for a generous price. Dae-hee and his co-worker knows something is fishy, but just go about their business. The next day, the band discovers their musical instruments and rent money stolen by the con man who offered to rent his apartment. Meanwhile, they become angry at civil worker Dae-hee who introduced them to the con man. They go visit Dae-hee at his office. To avoid a scene in front of his boss, Dae-hee quickly offers the band his basement for their practice sessions. Dae-hee seems to have little interest in music or the kids. Yet, days later when 2 members quit the band, Dae-hee is recruited to join the band as their bassist... Koreanfilm.org calls it "wry, funny" and "one of those unexpected pleasures: a film that is able to take a very ordinary situation, and turn it into something vivid, memorable and thoroughly entertaining." Recognizable to many fans of Korean cinema for his supporting roles, Yoon Je-moon as the protagonist is described as "one of the most memorable screen performances of 2012." Koreanfilm.org adds that "one hopes that the film's modest budget and lack of star power won't prevent it from reaching the widest possible audience."[3] Twitch Film also praised Yoon's performance, which "never veers into caricature. Instead, his slight mannerisms and idiosyncrasies add expressive layers to a standard fish-out-of-water character." Despite a few misgivings, they found the film "pleasant viewing" and that director Koo Ja-hong has "potential as a strong storyteller."[4] The Hollywood Reporter was not so positive, finding "little else going on here to make the film as cutting edge as it wants to be."[5]
