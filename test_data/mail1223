Olga Lugina and Karina Habudov were the champions last year when it was a Tier III event. Habudov did not compete this year, while Lugina teamed up with Sandra Nacuk. She was defeated in the quarterfinals. First seeds Ctlina Cristea and Irina Selyutina won the tournament, defeating Amlie Cocheteux and Janette Husrov in the final.
