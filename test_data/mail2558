Dilshan won the award of Twenty20 International Performance of the Year at the 2009 ICC Awards for his 96 off 57 balls against West Indies in the semi-final of the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in England. He also won man of the series trophy for his indiviual batting performances in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 tournament. Dilshan was born to a Malay father and a Sinhalese mother. He converted from Islam to Buddhism at the age of 16.[3] He was educated at Kalutara Vidyalaya National School in Kalutara. He is now married to Sri Lankan teledrama actress Manjula Thilini. The marriage was celebrated in India during the 2008 IPL series, following Hindu rituals.[4] Dilshan has a daughter from his second marriage and a son from his first marriage. Dilshan's brother, Tillakaratne Sampath, is a first-class cricketer in Sri Lanka.[5] Debuted against Zimbabwe in 1999. He scored his maiden Test hundred in the series with a 163. Dilshan also made his One day international debut against Zimbabwe before spending the next 15 months in and out of the side. Even when he played he never knew his place in the side as he was constantly being pushed up and down the order. His revival as an international cricketer came in 2003. In four consecutive Test innings he scored 63, 100, 83 and 104. The latter came against the world champion Australian side at Galle. In the first final of the 2005-06 VB Series, Dilshan's fielding made headlines when he made four runouts. In November 2007, Dilshan scored 188 for Bloomfield Cricket and Athletic Club against Colts Cricket Club in a 50 over game.[6] The innings is the joint 14th highest score made in any List A cricket match (alongside Gary Kirsten's 188 in 1996), and came from just 135 balls, at a strike rate of 139.25. He hit 14 fours and 12 sixes before being bowled by fellow Sri Lankan international Nuwan Kulasekara. The scorecard for the game can be found here [7] In the 2009 T20 world cup series, Dilshan became player of the series with 317 runs in seven matches which includes three half centuries. He maintained a 52.83 batting average throughout the series, which was the fourth best among all the cricketers, behind AD Mathews (Sri Lanka) with 75, J Kallis (South Africa) with 59.5 and Younis Khan (Pakistan) with 57.33.[8] Dilshan courted controversy for his apparent role in the Suraj Randiv no-ball incident that deprived Sehwag a century in the ODI between Sri Lanka and India on 16 August 2010. He was later fined his entire match-fee for allegedly instigating Randiv.[9] His scoop, played straight over the wicket keeper's head, was displayed for the first time during this tournament and came to be known as the Dilscoop in his honour. In the fourth season of Indian Premier League, he was contracted by Royal Challengers Bangalore for US$650,000. Tillakaratne Dilshan was the top run scorer in the 2011 Cricket World Cup. He scored 500 runs from nine One Day international innings with a best score of 144 runs against Zimbabwe. He scored two centuries, two half centuries, 61 boundaries and four sixes during the tournament which ended at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, India on 2 April 2011.[10] Immediately after the end of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011, with Kumar Sangakkara stepping down as captain, Dilshan was appointed captain of Sri Lanka in all three formats of the game.[11][12] However, shortly after his appointment as captain, cricket fans and pundits in Sri Lanka questioned if he was the right man to lead Sri Lanka.[13] On 29 December 2011, Sri Lanka registered their first ever Test win in South Africa. This also became their first Test win under Dilshan's captaincy.[14] However, after losing the Test series 21 and the subsequent ODI series 32, Dilshan resigned and was replaced by Mahela Jayawardene.[15] His highest score in One Day Internationals came against India at the Bellerive Oval on 28th February, 2012. He scored 160* off 165 balls. During this innings, he also shared a 200 run second run partnership with Kumar Sangakkara. This was the highest second wicket partnership for Sri Lanka in ODIs.Despite his performance Sri Lanka lost the match to India.
