Content:
AH receptor-interacting protein (AIP) also known as aryl-hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein, immunophilin homolog ARA9, or HBV X-associated protein 2 (XAP-2) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the AIP gene.[1][2][3] AIP may play a positive role in aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated signalling possibly by influencing its receptivity for ligand and/or its nuclear targeting. AIP is the cellular negative regulator of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein.[1] AIP mutations may be the cause of a familial form of acromegaly, familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA). Somatotropinomas (i.e. GH-producing pituitary adenomas), sometimes associated with prolactinomas, are present in most AIP mutated patients.[4] AIP has been shown to interact with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor,[3][5][6] peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha[7] and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator.[3][8]
