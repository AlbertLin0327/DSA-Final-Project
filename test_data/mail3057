Grand Kalle et l'African Jazz (often referred to simply as African Jazz) was perhaps the first full-time, professional band in what was then called Belgian Congo, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It was founded by Joseph Kabasele Tshamala, popularly known as Grand Kalle. Pablo Machine,Kumwimba sabiti makangira. Among their most popular songs was "Independence Cha Cha"[1] (1960) the pan-African hit which, like much of their recorded output, used Latin American rhythms like the Cuban chachach. They were, together with among others Franco Luambo's OK Jazz band, pioneers of the African variant of rumba, that later evolved into Soukous. Band members Dr Nico Kasanda, Tabu Ley Rochereau and Sam Mangwana were later successful with their own bands.
