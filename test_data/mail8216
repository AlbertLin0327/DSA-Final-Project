Perturbazione are an Italian indie pop rock band formed in Rivoli, Italy at the end of the 1980s. In 1988, in Rivoli, Tommaso Cerasuolo (singer), Rossano Antonio Lo Mele (drums) and other two schoolmates are the founders of the band. The following year Stefano Milano (bass) and Gigi Giancursi (guitar) will join them. Their debut (without the official singer, who will go back in again in 1991) is in 1990 at the end-of-the-school concert. In 1994, in order to enrich the sound, Elena Diana (cello and piano) joins the band. Two years later their first single will be Corridors/A Huge Mistake. In 1998 their first album Waiting to Happen, entirely sung in English, comes out. That very same year Cristiano Lo Mele (guitar) is the last member joining the band and Italian is chosen as the official language of their songs. At the beginning of 1999 their second album, the EP 36, comes out, with five songs in Italian and one in English. Between 1998 and 2002 there are other new songs and gigs. At the beginning of 2002 another new album, In circolo, comes to light. The band will be on tour till 2004, with more than 120 gigs. They will also be given the award of Best Italian Tour 2003. In 2005 they have a concert tour with the album Canzoni allo specchio. On April 13, 2007 there is a new album, entitled Pianissimo fortissimo (EMI). In 2008 Stefano Milano leaves the Perturbazione. The new entry is Alex Baracco (bass). In 2009 comes to light the albums Le citt viste dal basso, a long play record published in only 999 copies which include all the best songs of the homonym tour, and Enlarge your English, an LP to download which include 12 songs to teach English in the schools.
