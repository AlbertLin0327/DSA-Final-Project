Renkin 3-ky Magical? Pokn (3 ?, Renkin San-ky Majikaru? Pokn?) is an anime series that tells the story of the everyday life of four princesses from the Makai who are oblivious to the happenings in everyday life in the human world.[1] The name of the anime is often shortened to Magipoka. The opening sequence of the anime is deceptive to the viewer as it is not apparent that the anime's genre is comedy. There is no plot continuity to this anime (though three episodes are loosely connected to each other), but the story depicts the misadventures of four princesses from the Netherworld: Uma the Witch, Pachira the Vampire, Liru the Werewolf, and Aiko the Android along with their invisible chaperone Keimie. These princesses are adapting to life in the human world and reside in their Garakuta House (a makeshift treehouse complex with the name being a homage to the author of the same name) in Hikarigaoka (a fictional Japanese city that's not to be confused with Hikarigaoka Station). The girls are faced with small self-centered problems such as finding a boyfriend, blending in to society, learning about Earth's cultures, and staying one step ahead of scientist Super Doctor K-Ko. Each of the episodes were split into two segments. A. Dr. K-Ko and Hongo have devised traps that end up trapping Pachira, Liru, and Aiko. Thus, Uma ends up coming to the rescue. A. Following an incident at the prehistoric mammal section of the museum, Liru discovers love when she meets a man named Ryo who turns out to be another werewolf. A. When encountering a cute guy outside of a Blood Donation Bus, Pachira ends up donating some of her blood and ends up weak. This ends up tempting her to try to suck blood from Uma and Liru. A. During the rainy season, Aiko's systems are covered in mildew making her voice sound bad. While Liru is playing in the rain, Uma and Pachira try to clean Aiko's systems upon deactivating her. A. When a typhoon ruins their day at the beach, the girls try to improvise at the nearest hotel. A. In a follow-up to the ending of the previous episode, Uma has died and is condemned to Hell by Enma (played by Dr. K-Ko). In each level of Hell, Uma encounters hellish and demonic counterparts of her fellow princesses where she ends up driving them crazy. A. Liru prepares for the viewing of the Full Moon by obtaining the supplies to it and finding a perfect spot in the park to view the Full Moon at. A. People throughout Hikarigaoka are being attacked by a vampire at night. Jun, Tan, and Liru each suspect Pachira for the attacks upon seeing her silhouette attack someone. Pachira suspects that someone else is behind these attacks. A. While out getting Ishiyakiimo (yams baked on hot stones), Liru ends up saving a guy from being beaten up. She then ends up seeing a fallen CD with its shape turning her into her werewolf form. When Aiko invites him to their house, Liru doesn't want to be seen in her current form and Pachira wants him to herself. A. The girls hit the slopes and learn how to ski. When they fail to make a reservation at one of the lodges, they end up staying with some snow people who attempt to add them to their frozen collection. A. The girls play a "speaking English" game hosted by Keimie and a mess-up has them drinking the bad-tasting Natto drink. A. Aiko finds a VCR that contains her memories as a rerun of the girls' favorite show is airing. When the girls plan to use the VCR to tape it, they end up needing D/A Converter to hook it up to their Digital Television and search the entire country for one. The following episodes were exclusive to the DVDs. Lantis has released three CD albums:
