Radio and club DJ Gilles Peterson every three months or so does an All Winners Special in which he replays the previous few months' best new tracks --both singles/individual album tracks as well as whole albumshe has either played out when DJing or played on his BBC Radio 1 show Worldwide. At the end of the year, these winners, plus a few further favourites that may have been overlooked, get compiled into a longlist. Listeners of the show then get to vote this longlist down to a shortlist of ten Worldwide Winners in each section, via the Radio 1 website, which Gilles then plays over the last couple of editions of his radioshow at the end of the year. It has been compiled in various forms at the end of every year since 1998 to present, though the first few years did not involve any public vote. In recent years, from 2004 onwards, this has been expanded into the Worldwide Winners Awards with an event held at a London club venue during the very end of December or beginning of January, with outside broadcast recording by Radio 1, edited highlights of which are broadcast on a further one or two editions of the radio show at the start of January. Also further sections were added, like "Best Clubnight", "Best Recordshop", "Best Compilation Album", and a special award called "The John Peel 'Play More Jazz' Award" (a tribute to his Radio 1 colleague who died suddenly in 2004) given to an artist, often a newcomer, who has displayed special noteworthy work over the year.
