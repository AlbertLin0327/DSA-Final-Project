The Honda CM250 is a motorcycle produced by the Honda corporation from 1982 - 1984. It is the precursor to the current Honda CMX250C, also known as the Honda Rebel 250. It is based on the Honda CB250, but given more cruiser-like styling. This includes a wheel-hugging rear fender and fold-back handlebars. In the 1982 and 1984 production years, it had a chain drive whilst in the 1983 production year it featured a belt drive.
