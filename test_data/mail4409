Paul W. Bryant High School serves grades 9 through 12 and is located in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, forming part of the Tuscaloosa City Schools. The school is named after former Alabama Crimson Tide football head coach Paul William "Bear" Bryant. The school competes as part of the Alabama High School Athletic Association in Region 5 of the 5A division. With the 1999 lifting of the desegregation order that resulted in the creation of Central High School in 1979, the School Board began exploring the option to construct three new high schools to replace Central.[1] By the early 2000s (decade), Tuscaloosa City Schools announced that three new high schools would be constructed that would become Bryant, Northridge and a new Central High School. By September 2001, the board would award construction contracts totaling $100 million to implement the Five-Year Facilities Plan.[2] Costing $31.5 million to complete, the school would celebrate its ribbon-cutting on August 24, 2003, with U.S. Representative Artur Davis delivering the keynote address.[3] In January 2002, the Tuscaloosa City Schools School Board voted to name the school after Alabama Crimson Tide football head coach Paul William "Bear" Bryant.[4] The name was selected after being suggested by a resident during a community meeting regarding the new school.[4] Originally, the mascot was to be the "Bears" playing on the famous nickname of Paul Bryant.[5] However, because of a court order relating to the consolidation of the Druid High School Dragons and the Tuscaloosa High School Black Bears in the 1970s that stated that no new school in Tuscaloosa may take a nickname used by any of the former segregated schools, "Bears" could not be used for the new Bryant High School.[5][6] Additionally, the name "Titans"voted on by students of schools that would feed into Bryantwas rejected because Holy Spirit High School's teams were already named the Titans.[5] "Stampede" was ultimately chosen as the mascot for the school.[7] Paul W. Bryant has a program offered to junior and seniors called Co-Op that provides students with the technical and hands on experience of the work force while in school. The Program is taught by Mrs. Jenna McCombs, who is also one of the DECCA supervisors.[8] Paul W. Bryant High School currently fields a varsity team in nine men's and eight women's sports.[9] They are: Men's sports Women's sports
