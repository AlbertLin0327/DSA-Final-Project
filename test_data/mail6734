Thomas Frederick "Fred" Shaw (27 March 19091994) was an English professional footballer who scored 23 goals in 94 appearances in the Football League playing for Birmingham, Notts County, Mansfield Town and Bournemouth & Boscombe Atletic.[2] Shaw was born in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. He began his football career with Annesley Colliery and also played for Darlaston before turning professional with Birmingham in October 1932.[3] Shaw made his debut in the First Division on 29 January 1934 in a 31 defeat at Blackburn Rovers.[4] A mobile, lightweight inside forward, Shaw did not fit into Birmingham's style of play, and enjoyed greater success when he moved to Notts County. Put straight into the starting eleven for the Second Division match at home to Swansea Town, Shaw repaid his manager with a hat-trick, becoming only the second player in Notts County history to achieve the feat on his debut.[5][6] After scoring 21 goals in 56 league games in two-and-a-half seasons, Shaw spent a season with Mansfield Town and another with Bournemouth & Boscombe Atletic before returning ot his native Nottinghamshire on the outbreak of the Second World War.[2][3]
