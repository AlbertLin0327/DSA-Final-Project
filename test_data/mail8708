Quarry tile is a building construction material, usually 1/2 to 3/4 inches (13 to 19 mm) thick, made by the extrusion process from natural clay or shales. [1][2] The most traditional size in the US is nominally 6 inches by 6 inches by 1/2 inch thick. Other common sizes include 4 inches by 8 inches and 8 inches by 8 inches. Traditional quarry tile was unglazed and either red or gray; however, modern "decorator" tiles come in a variety of tints and finishes. Industrial quarry tile is available with abrasive frit embedded in the surface to provide a non-slip finish in wet areas such as commercial kitchens and laboratories. Quarry tile is extensively used for floors where a very durable material is required. It can be used either indoors or outdoors, although freeze-resistant grades of tile should be used outdoors in climates where freeze-thaw action occurs. Quarry tile is used less often as a wall finish and is occasionally used for countertops, although the wide grout joints can make cleaning of countertops difficult. In the kitchen, quarry tile serves as a great low cost baking stone. Since it is fired at high temperatures while in production, there is no worry about the stone being susceptible to moderate temperatures that the standard house oven is capable of. The natural pores of the quarry are great for absorbing moisture. This can be a real bargain for the cook on a budget since it can save you in upwards of $100.00 that you would normally spend on a baking stone. For floors, quarry tile is usually set in a thick bed of cementitious mortar. For wall applications, it can be set in either a thick bed of cementitious mortar or a thin bed of mastic. For both floors and walls, the joints between tiles are usually grouted with cementitious grout. Grout joints are traditionally about 3/8 inch in width. Matching trim shapes such as coves, bases, shoes, and bullnoses are available to turn corners and terminate runs of the tile.
