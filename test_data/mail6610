He was particularly known for his portrayal of Wagner and Meyerbeer heroes.[1] Born in Verviers, Warot studied initially with his father and then in Paris with Giulio Alary. He made his professional opera dbut at the Opra-Comique in 1858 in Armand Marie Ghislain Limnander de Nieuwenhove's Les montngrins. The following year he created the role of the Reaper in the premiere of Meyerbeer's Dinorah. In 1860 he sang the role of Beppe in the premiere of Donizetti's Rita. From 1861 until 1869 he was engaged at the Paris Opera. While there he portrayed roles in several world premieres, including Tebaldo in Victor Masss La mule de Pedro (1863) and Don Alvaro in Meyerbeer's L'Africaine (1865). He also sang Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni, the title hero in Le comte Ory, Henri in Les vpres siciliennes, and Masaniello in La muette de Portici.[1] Warot was committed to La Monnaie from 18681876 where he portrayed such parts as Riccardo in Un ballo in maschera, Manrico in Il trovatore, Erik in The Flying Dutchman, the title role in Tannhuser, Raoul in Les Huguenots, Elazar in La Juive, and John of Leyden in Le prophte. From 1876 until his retirement from the stage in 1888 he remained active as a freelance artist at major opera houses in France and Belgium.[1] Warot devoted himself to teaching singing after his opera career ended, ultimately being appointed to the faculty of the Paris Conservatoire.
