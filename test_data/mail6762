Club Gimnasia y Esgrima de Rosario, or simply GER, is a rugby union team, part of the sports club from Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina. The squad currently plays in the Unin de Rugby de Rosario league system and also takes part in the Torneo del Litoral. GER has won the provincial title 5 times. The club was originally founded as Club Atltico Argentino on September 10, 1904, when the old Club Atltico Argentino merged with Estudiantes Football Club de Rosario. In 1914, the club changed its name to its current denomination. Although GER had always hosted many sports, rugby union did not appeared at the club until 1927. By 1929 a rugby section was officially formed and GER entered the Unin de Rugby de Rosario league system in 1931.
