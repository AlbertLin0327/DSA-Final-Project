"Sittin' Sidewayz" is a song by American rapper Paul Wall, released as the first single from his album The Peoples Champ. It features rapper Big Pokey and was produced by Salih Williams. The single's music video had cameo appearances by Bun B, Three 6 Mafia, Big Hawk and Jim Jones. The song samples a line by Big Pokey from his verse on DJ Screw's "June 27th". The song is featured prominently in the game Def Jam: Icon and also made appearances in the games SSX on Tour and Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix. It is also featured in the 2006 theatrical film Grandma's Boy. Months later, Lupe Fiasco and Jay-Z made a remix to "Sittin' Sidewayz" with permission, but without the use of Paul Wall. Later on, a Latin remix was also made by Stunta, Chingo Bling, and Lucky Luciano under permission but did not include Paul Wall in it. In 2010, Crooked I also released a freestyle to the song.
