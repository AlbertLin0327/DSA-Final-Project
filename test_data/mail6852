Canadian Accredited Independent Schools (CAIS) is a national organization for independent schools in Canada. It was formed in October 2009, as the result of a merger between the Canadian Educational Standards Institute and the Canadian Association of Independent Schools.[1] Until February 2011, the organization went by the name of Standards in Excellence And Learning (SEAL Canada).[2] CIAS encompasses 93 accredited independent schools, and its aim is to collaborate in the pursuit of leadership, training, research and innovation, and application of international standards. The stated vision of the organization is to be "the voice of excellence in learning and leadership, we shape the future of education in Canada and the world."[3]
