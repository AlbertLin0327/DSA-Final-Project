The Genie Award for Best Live Action Short Drama is an awarded by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television to the best Canadian live action short drama film. Note that because of variable scheduling of the ceremony, the eligibility period has not always been consistent. Accordingly, ceremonies are listed here by the year in which they were held, not necessarily the year in which nominated films were released.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
