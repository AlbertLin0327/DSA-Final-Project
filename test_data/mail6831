Content:
A wildlandurban interface refers to the zone of transition between unoccupied land and human development. Communities that are within 0.5 miles (0.80km) of the zone may also be included. These lands and communities adjacent to and surrounded by wildlands are at risk of wildfires. Hydro-pyrogeography is the term of art used to describe the prevention of and/or the interruption of the spread of wildfire occurrences, with the use of atmospheric generated water grassland and vegetation sprinkling and soaking systems, also known as the atmospheric generated water wildfire prevention system, placed strategically within any wildlandurban interface, anywhere world wide. The term, coined by the inventor of the atmospheric generated water wildfire prevention system, hydro-pyrogeography compliments the geoscience study of wildfire and its behavior. http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hydro-Pyrogeography.tif
