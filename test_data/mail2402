Carolyne Wright (born Bellingham, WA) is an American poet.

She is Translation Editor of Artful Dodge.[3] Her work appeared in AGNI,[4] Artful Dodge, Hotel Amerika, Hunger Mountain, Iowa Review, Michigan Quarterly Review, New England Review, New Orleans Review, North American Review, Poetry, Poets & Writers, Southern Review. From 2004-2008, she served on the Board of Directors of the Association of Writers & Writing Programs (AWP). Since 2005, she teaches at the Whidbey Writers Workshop.[5] In 2008, she is Thornton Poet in Residence at Lynchburg College,[6] and Distinguished Northwest Poet at Seattle University. She lives in Seattle.[7] Carolyne Wright's journey through nearly four decades shows that the past is often a world that resists disclosure, and yet the fact is less a fact about the past than a fact about our ability to find signposts among contingent scenarios. Wright has this ability; which is less a concession to the spell of technique (which she owns) than a kind of knowledge about poetry's secret sway and coterie wisdom and therefore of abiding interest to poetry's serious readersbe they ever so fewwho know that the intramural is what we used to call the universal, but know also that that is no come-down but a field promotion fitting for the lean hereafter.[8] Carolyne Wright's latest poetry collection, A Change of Maps, may remind those with keen memories of Matthew Arnold's poem "The Scholar Gipsy," in which a mysterious male figure abandons the safety of Oxford's "dreaming spires" to wander the world in search of truth.[9]
