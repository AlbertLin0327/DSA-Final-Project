Qwt or Qt Widgets for Technical Applications is a set of custom Qt widgets, GUI Components and utility classes which are primarily useful for programs with a technical background. Beside a 2D plot widget it provides scales, sliders, dials, compasses, thermometers, wheels and knobs to control or display values, arrays, or ranges of type double. [1]
