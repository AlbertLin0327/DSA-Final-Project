clade Euthyneura clade Nudipleura clade Pleurobranchomorpha The warty pleurobranch, scientific name Pleurobranchaea bubala, is a species of marine gastropod mollusc in the family Pleurobranchidae. This species is endemic to the South African coast, and is found only from Hout Bay to Jeffreys Bay[1] in 5-30 m of water.[2] The warty pleurobranch has an oval sandy-coloured body with large opaque white bumps on the notum. It has a spade-shaped head and two widely separated rhinophores. There is a single gill on right hand side of body. It can be confused with the dwarf warty pleurobranch, which is smaller, has a smoother skin and can be found in deeper water.[1] This pleurobranch is a voracious predator on other opisthobranchs. It has been seen eating smaller individuals of the same species.[3] Its egg ribbon is a sizeable roll of several white loops.
