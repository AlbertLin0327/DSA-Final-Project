Fagraea berteriana (sometimes as F. berteroana), commonly known as the Pua keni keni or Perfume Flower Tree, is a small spreading tree or a large shrub which grows in the sub-tropics, where temperatures are 10C or more. It is indigenous to the Samoa Islands where it is known as the pua-lulu and occurs from New Caledonia to eastern Polynesia. [1] The plant has quad-angular branches, blunt tipped leaves, and fragrant 7cm tubular shaped flowers of creamy white. The flowers are popular for making lei. The tree's name, in Hawaiian, means "ten cent flower," referring to the sale price for the flower in the past.
