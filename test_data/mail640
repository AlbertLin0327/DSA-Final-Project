Maurice "Mush" Dubofsky (19091970) was an American football player and coach. Dubofsky was an offensive lineman at Georgetown University from 19291931, earning honorable mention All-American honors in 1930. After graduating, he played five games for the New York Giants in 1932. Following this brief professional career, he returned to Georgetown as an assistant coach until the program was disbanded in 1951. With the revival of Hoya football in the 1960s, Dubofsky would return as head coach in 1968, compiling an 8-4 record in two seasons of coaching the club level team. Georgetown annually awards the Dubofsky Award to the best student athlete on the team.
