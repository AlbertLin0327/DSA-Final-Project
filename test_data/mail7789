The Shuggling Stone or "Clochnabogaddy" is a 13 ton boulder that sits at the edge of the moorland road between the Lackagh Bridge and Glen village in County Donegal in Ireland, so called because it 'shuggles' very easily.[1] Shuggling is an Irish word meaning to rattle, shake or jiggle something. With the aid of a short stick the huge boulder can be rocked or shuggled backwards and forwards. The stone is a lump of glacial granite and was first recorded in 1834 by Lt. Lancey during the first Ordnance Survey of Ireland; he noted then that it could be rocked back and forth with one finger.[2]
