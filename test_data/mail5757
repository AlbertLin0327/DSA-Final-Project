Vivir Intentando (English: Go for it) is an Argentine 2003 family, musical film starring the 5 members of girl group Bandana. The film provides a fictional account of the band's formation, and premiered on 14 June 2003 in Buenos Aires. The film met with mixed reviews. One critic claimed it a success "thanks to the competent technical aspects, precise use of emotion that plays with the audience, but above all, the atmosphere which it creates in the cinema."[1] Others were less complimentary, commenting "their acting talents are just passable.....the songs shine due to the absence thereof..... and the script comes straight from the 'teenager dreams of being a singer' handbook"[2] In spite of this, the movie grossed over ARS 1,500,000.[3]
