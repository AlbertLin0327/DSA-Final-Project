The 49th Brigade was a formation of British Army. It was part of the new army also known as Kitchener's Army. It was assigned to the 16th (Irish) Division and served on the Western Front during the First World War. The infantry battalions did not all serve at once, but all were assigned to the brigade during the war. [1]
