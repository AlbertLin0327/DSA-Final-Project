Villajoyosa (Spanish:[biaxoosa]) or La Vila Joiosa (Valencian:[la vila dojoza]) is a coastal town and municipality in the province of Alicante, Valencian Community, Spain, by the Mediterranean Sea. It is the historic and administrative capital of the comarca of Marina Baixa and is located 32km from the city of Alicante, in the coastal area known as Costa Blanca (White Coast). La Vila Joiosa literally means Joyful Village, although the inhabitants often abbreviate it to La Vila. It has over three kilometers of beaches, including La Platja Centre (Central Beach), close to the city centre. The river Amadrio runs through La Vila. The area is famous for its chocolate industry and tourism. One of the most popular tourist attractions is its Gothic Catholic church, with a Baroque altar piece. Another popular destination is the Royal Palm Casino (formerly Casino Costa Blanca). The town is also important for its festival of Moros i cristians, declared an International Tourist Interest Festival.
