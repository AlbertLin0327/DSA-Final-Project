Andrew Schar, or Andrew "Schr" as is correctly spelt, is a singer/songwriter from South Africa known for his informal gigs, and ability to make up songs on the fly. He has spent time recording in London, but returned home to South Africa, where his heart is. With somewhat of a Jack Johnson/John Mayer style, and lyrics that tell a story of broken hearts and idealistic hopes, his music will hit home with a resounding glow.[1] Although he shares the same name as lead singer of the American Christian Band "The W's", they are in no way related. Andrew's 2006 Album entitled "You, Me, and the Great Escape", features 13 of his original tracks, including 3 studio recorded radio edits, and 1 live bonus track.[2] KIA Motors America has recently purchased Andrew's song entitled "Where I'll Be" for use in their new KIA Sorento: Frames, 2008 Commercial currently flighting on American TV[3] His song "Over You" is currently at #22 on the Take40 SA Charts (http://www.take40sa.co.za/) after being at #29 the week before, and entering at #38 the week before that.[4] He is also featured in a South African Airways Commercial entitled "Speed Dating" currently flighting SA TV.
