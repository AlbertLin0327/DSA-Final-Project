Colinette  la cour, ou La double preuve, is an opra comique (designated as a comdie lyrique) in three acts written by Andr Grtry in 1782 to a French libretto by Jean-Baptiste Lourdet de Santerre, based on Charles Simon Favarts Ninette  la cour. It was first performed at Acadmie Royale de Musique, Paris in 1 January 1782.
