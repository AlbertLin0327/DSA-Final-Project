The F.O.D. Control Corporation[1] is the first private company dedicated entirely to serving the aviation industry's need for specialized equipment and information to address FOD (Foreign Object Damage/Debris) issues at military and civilian airfields. Based in Tucson, Arizona, the company helps the aviation industry to implement or improve successful FOD prevention programs by providing educational and training materials and equipment. This includes the first and only FOD Prevention Program manual, "MAKE IT FOD FREE",[2] and the online news and information resource FODNews.com.[3] Founder and General Manager Gary Chaplin started the business in March 1983 in San Bernardino, California, in response to the US Air Forces need for improved methods to remove debris from their airfield pavements and aircraft operating surfaces. The first product introduced was a truck-bumper mounted permanent magnetic sweeper (trade name Power Bar[4]) at Norton AFB in California. The product was a success, replacing its less efficient predecessor, the gas-powered electromagnetic sweeper, at over 90% of military airfields and many civilian airports. With the success of the magnetic sweeper, the firms military customers requested additional help in clearing their airfields of more than just ferrous metal material. Sand, rocks, broken paving materials and non-ferrous work generated hardware presented a problem that conventional truck mounted vacuum sweepers and FOD walks were not thoroughly handling. Chaplin came across a traction driven lawn and leaf sweeper, and realized that that if made larger it would offer a solution for sweeping non-ferrous debris. He went on to invent and develop the Fodbuster RockSweeper in 1987. A towable, traction driven sweeper with brush drive mechanism geared to its wheels, the Fodbuster was brought to market to serve military and civilian airfields. Soon after the RockSweeper introduction, the company embarked on a multi-year expansion of their product offerings to meet the growing requirements of the aviation industry. A number of new lines were added, including walk-behind vacuum sweepers, small parts organizers, debris deposal containers, and promotional and awareness training materials such as posters, decals and downloadable PowerPoint training presentations. Over the ensuing several years Chaplin developed and in 2004 published "MAKE IT FOD FREE, The Ultimate FOD Prevention Program Manual[2] in response to client requests for assistance in designing, implementing, and/or upgrading effective FOD prevention programs. For the effort he recruited a multinational team of FOD program experts from all sectors of aviation to provide detailed guidance for helping others in the industry fight FOD. Following the MAKE IT FOD FREE book[2] project, FODNews.com[3] was launched as a free online news publication. Specializing in news and information about FOD control methods and FOD related issues, it includes links to news articles, instructional materials, research reports, photos, videos and other useful information. As part of the aviation worlds increasing awareness of the need for comprehensive FOD prevention strategies, the company continues to develop new products, distribute new information and serve as an advisor to industry and governmental initiatives in the field of airside safety.
