Anthony John Russell (born 25 January 1943) was the previous Bishop of Ely in the Church of England. Russell was educated at Uppingham School, St Chad's College, Durham and Trinity College, Oxford, where he earned a DPhil degree. He studied for ordination at Ripon College (Cuddesdon). Russell was a curate in the Hilborough group of parishes in the Diocese of Norwich from 1970 to 1973. From 1973 to 1976 he was priest-in-charge of Preston-on-Stour with Whitchurch and of Atherstone on Stour in the Diocese of Coventry. For the next 11 years he was the vicar of Preston-on-Stour and Whitchurch with Atherstone and also canon theologian of Coventry Cathedral. From 1973 to 1982 he was chaplain of the Arthur Rank Centre and its director from 1983 to 1988. From 1983 to 1988 Russell served as a chaplain to The Queen.[1][2] He was nominated as Bishop of Dorchester in 1987[3] and consecrated in 1988, before being nominated as the Bishop of Ely in 2000.[4] Russell initiated proceedings in the church courts against the Vicar of Trumpington, Tom Ambrose. He retired on 28 February 2010.[5] Russell has published a number of books, especially on the role of the church in the countryside. These include The Country Parson (1993), The Country Parish (1986) and The Clerical Profession (1980). He is a leading spokesman for the church on rural and farming matters. Russell, as a keen horseman, upon appointment as Bishop of Dorchester, changed his Oxfordshire episcopal residence in order to secure suitable stabling.
