Agustin Fuentes is an American primatologist and biological anthropologist whose work focuses largely on human and non-human primate interaction, pathogen transfer, communication, cooperation, and human social evolution. Fuentes graduated from University of California, Berkeley with a B.A. in Anthropology and Zoology, as well as an M.A. and PhD in Anthropology, and has since been researching his main interests in the fields of biological anthropology and primatology. He is currently a professor in the Department of Anthropology at University of Notre Dame, as well as the director for their Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts. One of Dr. Fuentes' major impacts on the field of primatology has been his work on human and non-human primate interactions. He has worked extensively with populations of macaques in Bali and Gibraltar, where the monkeys are a large tourist attraction, focusing on the spread of diseases between humans and macaques.[1] He has also done extensive work in the area of human social evolution, particularly relating to the neurological aspects. Dr. Fuentes believes that increased social complexity was necessary for our interaction with the environment and within our own social groups.[2] It is this increased complexity along with primate biology and a changing environment that he believes is responsible for the success of humans in terms of expansion beyond the limits of most animal species.
