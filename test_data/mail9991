Xbia (Valencian:[aia]) or Jvea (Spanish:[xaea])[1] is a coastal town located in the comarca of Marina Alta, in the province of Alicante, Valencia, Spain, by the Mediterranean Sea. Situated behind a wide bay and sheltered between two rocky headlands, the town has become a very popular small seaside resort and market town. Xbia/Jvea is situated in the north of the province, on the eastern-most point of the Mediterranean Sea coast. The island of Ibiza lies some 90 km to the east, and it can be seen on clear days. Flat, fertile agricultural land stretches for miles inland, criss-crossed by small streams and used primarily for growing citrus and olive trees. The coastline of Xbia/Jvea features four capes; Cabo de San Antonio, Cap de la Nau (the largest), Cap Negre and Cap Mart. The Montg, which shelters Xbia/Jvea, is the highest summit of the region standing at a height of over 750m. From the Xbia/Jvea side, it is said to resemble an elephant. The Natural Park of Montg was declared in 1987, it stretches across the area of La Plana to the cape of Sant Antoni. Xbia/Jvea is protected from harsh winter winds of the north by the massif of Montg (753 m / 2,471ft) and it enjoys a unique microclimate that the World Health Organisation named as one of the healthiest in the world.[2] There are more recorded hours of sunshine per year in Xbia/Jvea than in any other place in Spain, making it a popular destination for Northern Europeans during the cold winter months. Since the 1970s Xbia/Jvea has become a popular place for affluent Northern European expatriates to purchase retirement villas and the town has an active property industry. Around 7,700 British nationals are registered as resident in the area,[3] as well as some 2,000 Germans[3] and many other nationalities. The town's population is now around 31,100;[3] but this is greatly swelled to well over 100,000 by the annual influx of summer tourists, with Spanish tourists predominating at the height of August. Since 2000, Xbia/Jvea's infrastructure has been undergoing significant expansion and improvement work, but the local government has restricted the height and types of new buildings and thus helping to retain much of the town's character. Many new estates of villas have been built in the wooded hills around the bay whilst apartment complexes are being constructed along the coastal strip between the port and the Arenal. The plain remains largely untouched and the groves still produce crops of oranges. Since 2004 the town has been running a local Agenda 21 programme. This is a UN-sponsored non-political initiative in which the inhabitants of Xbia/Jvea can have a say in plans for the long-term sustainable development of the town.[4] The town is currently (2008) drawing up a general town plan for development over the next 15 years. Xbia/Jvea has good road connections to regional capitals. Both Alicante and Valencia airports are just over an hour's drive away. There are regular and direct coach links to both Alicante and Valencia as well as a daily service to Madrid. The nearest rail station is at Gata de Gorgos, about 10km inland, with a regular service to Alicante. There is a regular car ferry to Ibiza and the other Balearic Islands from Xbia/Jvea's close by neighbouring town, Dnia. The town can be split into three distinct areas: the old town, the port and the Arenal. The old town was once a walled town to protect the inhabitants from marauding pirates that once sailed this coast and there is still evidence of the presence of these fortifications; stone crosses mark the original gates in three locations. In the centre of town, mostly built in original Tosca stone hewn from the rocky shore, sits the church of Sant Bartomeu which dates back to the late 14th century but there is evidence that some of the structure may date back a further 300 years. The church suffered extensive damage during the Spanish Civil War and its southern and western walls remain pockmarked with bullet and shell holes. It was listed as a National Historic and Artistic Monument in 1931 and remains a centrepiece of Xbia/Jvea's Old Town. The modern municipal market sits opposite on the northern side of the church and stands on the site of the convent of Agustines Descalces (the barefoot Augustine nuns). Built in 1946, and recently refurbished, the market retains the style of the area and sells fresh fruit and vegetables, locally-caught fish, and meat from the local area. There is also an ethnographical museum (Museu Arqueolgic i Etnogrfic "Soler Blasco") and an established art gallery in the old town, Atelier 1 with regular art exhibitions are held in the gallery at the town's library. There is range of bars and restaurants which serve local and international cuisine. The port also has a number of restaurants (some on the sea front), a gravel beach and marina. Whilst the history of the harbour stretches back to the 15th century, the first jetty was built in 1871 and it became an important gateway for the export of raisins. The raisin trade collapsed at the end of the 19th century and the settlement became a mere fishing harbour. The modern harbour was built in the 1950s and 1960s. The nautical club has been in the central area of the harbour since 1963. The landmark is the church of Mare de Du de Loreto, built in 1967 to represent the heart and feelings of Xbia/Jvea's fishing quarter. Its shape is that of an oval boat keel and it was built to resemble a fishing vessel bursting through the waves. The sandy beach area is an arc of wide white sand flanked by a promenade of shops, bars and restaurants. During the summer evenings there are a number of stalls selling handmade crafts. Many of the bars offer live music and stay open until the early hours. Sand artists and street entertainers work along the Arenal beach during the summer months. The Punta de l'Arenal behind the Parador Nacional Hotel was once an important Roman settlement where the fish sauce garum was produced. On the other end of the small bay once stood the Fontana Castle, built in 1424 and destroyed by the English during the Peninsular War in the early 19th century; the ruins of the castle now lie under modern apartment buildings but some of the castle's surviving cannons sit outside the church of Sant Bartomeu in the old town. The Montg Natural Park was founded on 16 March 1987. It covers approximately 21.5km situated between Xbia/Jvea and its neighbours Jess Pobre and Dnia. Standing at 753 m high, the summit of Montg is the second highest peak so close to the sea in the Mediterranean; on a clear day the island of Ibiza can be seen. Traces of the earliest human presence in this area date back 30,000 years, from the upper Paleolithic. They were small nomadic groups which occupied the Foradada cave and ravines facing the sea at Cap de la Nau. These were hunter/gatherer communities. Around 5000 BC the first agriculture and livestock communities developed with the appearance of pottery and polished stone. Arrowheads, fragments of various vessels, carved stone and bone, as well as remains of human burials from this period have been found in the caves of Montg and Barranc de Migdia where schematic paintings are also found. Metal utensils dating from the Bronze Age (3000 BC) have also been found in these caves. The villages were situated on small hills, like the one where Xbia/Jvea's chapel of Santa Llcia is located. The indigenous Iberian culture began to develop in the 8th century BC. At the top of Benimquia, (western-most tip of the Montg) is an Iberian settlement of seventh century BC. Here Phoenician amphorae have been found. Findings of pottery, coins, ornaments in the area of the Coll de Pous (Western end of the Montg) and the Penya de l'guila with its defensive walls (on top of the ridge), confirm the presence of the Iberians until 1st Century BC. The Romans continued to use the Montg as a place for observation and surveillance to protect the increasingly important trading port of Dianum (Dnia), which was already a sizeable town in the first century AD. Remains from excavations can be seen in the Xbia/Jvea archaeological museum. A range of abandoned windmills crown La Plana, most of which date back to the 18th century. The park besides its archaeological importance has flora which includes a large number of Iberian endemic plants. The Moorish Caliph Abd-ar-Rahman III who, at the beginning of the 10th century, made a special journey from Crdoba,to collect over a hundred medicinal herbs from the slopes of Montg. The area was first inhabited in prehistoric times, 30,000 years ago by cave dwellers on Montg. Subsequent residents have included Stone Age, Romans, Greeks, Phoenicians, Visigoths, Germanic, Carthaginians, and Moors, Bronze-age peoples. Roman fishing boats used the port, and there is evidence that dates the Roman occupation of Xbia/Jvea to the 2nd century BC, it makes Xbia the oldest known Roman site on the coast with a commercial port for fish and minerals. In the 6th century AD. Christian Visigoth monks, came to Xbia and founded the monastery of Sant Mart, now gone but probably gave its name to the Cap San Mart. Hermenegild, son of the Visigoth king Leovigild of Toledo, sought refuge in the Monastery after angering his father by marrying a Christian girl. When his father's troops arrived to arrest him all but one monk fled to Portichol but Hermenegild and the old monk were killed.[citation needed] A number of locals with Visigoth names can be found even today. There is little left of the Moors other than some inscribed gravestones and ceramics, although they were here from about 714AD until being expelled from Xbia/Jvea in 1609. Also alongside the Montg is the 14th century hermitage of Popol, most likely on a very ancient sacred site, possibly built over an underground stream as were many religious buildings. The town's market day is on Thursdays, except when there is a local or national holiday. There are four main fiestas: the festivities of Jess Natzar (April / May) in honour of the perpetual mayor of the town, the Fogueres de Sant Joan (June) which are pagan in origin and commemorate Midsummer and are widespread throughout the Valencian Community, the Moros i cristians (July) parades, which take place in the port area and celebrate the defeat of the Moors by Christian forces in the 13th Century, and the Mare de Du de Loreto (September) with the bull-running on the harbour walls and a firework display. Sports and hobby activities are catered for in the area, including cycling, diving, fishing, golf, horse-riding, mountain-biking, photography, bowls, sailing, trekking; there are many shops & rental centres that serve these pursuits. The nightlife in Xbia/Jvea is centred around the Arenal where there is a selection of bars and clubs. During the summer, several chiringuitos (beach bars) spring up along the seafront between the Arenal and the port area. The old town region also hosts a wide variety of nightlife options, ranging from the more traditional Spanish bars to modern nightclubs frequented by the locals. A night out in Jvea can be enjoyed by the Arenal beach with a sea view at busy night clubs such as Achill or Atalya. The area also contains the local Spanish favorite Socco and plenty of smaller cervezerias. The prices on the Arenal Beach are relatively high for the Javea area, you are paying for the sea view and vicinity to all the tourist accommodations. If you prefer a cheap night out in Jvea heading up to the historic centre and exploring the night clubs such as Penelope and Embruix is generally a better option. You can read more detailed information about night clubs in Jvea or try out some of the many pleasant choices by the beach, in the old town or in a beach bar. In general the night life in Jvea is a safe place to enjoy yourself. Unlike other resorts you will rarely see any forms of crimes, brawls or other disturbances. CD Jvea play in the Valencia Regional Preferente, the equivalent level of the Football Conference in England. Jvea Green Bowls Club play in the Costa Blanca Bowls Association Northern & Winter Leagues. Xbia/Jvea is served well by a number of schools. Junior education is available at C.P. Grall (town), C.P. Port de Xbia, C.P. Vicente Tena (town), C.P. Trenc d'Alba (town) and secondary education at I.E.S. Antoni Llid (town) and I.E.S. Nmero 1 de Xbia (port). Being a popular destination for ex-pats, both English and other nationalities, there is a market for international education. The first "International" school to start-up in the area was The Lady Elizabeth School, started by Veronica Barnes. Since then, Xabia International College has also formed. The Lady Elizabeth School and Xabia International College both have junior schools, and offer full-time education up to A-Level standard. The Lady Elizabeth School Senior School has since moved to Xal, an inland area 30 minutes from Xbia/Jvea, while the Junior school has moved to 10km away to Cumbre del Sol in Benitatxell to a brand new school. Xbia International College is now the only international school in the town.
