George S. Middleton High School is a high school in Tampa, Florida named in honor of George S. Middleton, an African American businessman and civic leader who moved to Tampa from South Carolina in the late 19th century. Middleton was established for black students in 1934 during the segregation era. The current facility opened in 2002 on North 22nd Street in East Tampa. Middleton's mascot is the Tiger. Its rival school in Hillsborough County is Howard W. Blake High School. A historical marker recounts the school's history.[1] It was an all-black school for nearly 40 years and remains predominantly black along with its surrounding neighborhood. In 2002 it reopened with community support. In 2008, a report recounted the school's struggles to improve academic achievement.[2] Middleton High School was the first high school for African Americans in Hillsborough County when it opened in 1934 on 24th and Chelsea Streets in East Tampa. Booker T. Washington School (Tampa) had accommodated junior and senior high students. A 1940 fire destroyed the school and was rebuilt through the Works Progress Administration (WPA). There was a second fire in 1960. [1] Middleton closed in 1971 as a result of desegregation, becoming Middleton Junior High School renamed A.J. Ferrell Middle School of Technology in 1993. The high school reopened in a new location in 2002 with the support of alumni.[3] The magnet school programs at George S. Middleton High School are designed to help students enter career paths in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The objective is to give students a balanced and rigorous curriculum leading directly to industry, technical school, or university training. Students take science, mathematics, and technical classes leading to college credit through Advanced Placement, Dual-Enrollment, and/or articulated agreements. Middleton graduates have computer experienceand take elective classes in fine art and performing arts, business, journalism in addition to clubs and organizations. Magnet students at Middleton choose one magnet program for their major, but they are encouraged to explore classes in other magnet programs that may be of interest to them. Magnet students may complete more than one magnet program, although they are only required to complete their major. Taking online classes with Florida Virtual School is recommended so that students can complete all their required and elective classes by graduation.[4] The school offers magnet programs in Urban Teaching, Biomedicine, Computer Systems Technology, Computer Game Design, and Engineering. Both biomedicine and engineering are Project Lead The Way programs.  The engineering program is based on the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) model, a nationally recognized high school pre-engineering curriculum [5] PLTW Courses in this curriculum include: After completing Middletons Engineering Magnet Pathway, students are well-prepared for the rigors of engineering courses at the university level. Middleton is a certified PLTW high school, which means students can earn college credit for their engineering classes at PLTW Engineering Universities, such as Purdue and Duke.  The Academy of Computer Game Design prepares students for video game design and animation. Students practice the technology skills in programming, graphic design, management, and 3D modeling. Creating games includes the building and management of complex data bases. Students receive hands-on experience in planning and actually building their own original games. Games can be designed to play on multiple platforms such as online, personal computer, cell phone, Nintendo DS, and Xbox 360. Students are educated with the foundational knowledge to pursue further training and a career in game design and animation, earned Industry Certifications, such as MOS (Microsoft Office Specialist), Adobe Certified Associate-Photoshop, Adobe Certified Associate-Flash, and Autodesk Certification (3D Studio Max or Maya) learned complex technology skills that can be transferred to other careers, such as data base development and management for business systems.[6]  The Cisco Networking Academy is an education program that teaches students how to design, build, troubleshoot, and secure computers and computer networks for increased access to career and economic opportunities. The Networking Academy provides online courses, interactive tools, and hands-on learning activities to help individuals prepare for careers in virtually every type of industry. Students will begin the program by studying the hardware and software of personal computers in preparation for the nationally recognized A+ Certification Exam. Hands-on labs and virtual desktop learning tools will help students develop critical thinking and complex problem-solving skills. The Cisco CCNA curriculum will then provide an integrated and comprehensive coverage of networking topics, from fundamentals to advanced applications and services, while providing opportunities for hands-on practical experience and soft-skills development. Students will be prepared for the CCNA and CCENT exams. This program allows students to develop the skills necessary to enter all fields of computer programming and computer engineering at the postsecondary level.[7] Biotechnology is a field of applied biology that involves the use of living organisms and bioprocesses in engineering, technology, medicine and other fields requiring bioproducts; work in biotechnology includes genetic engineering as well as cell culture and tissue culture technologies. Students in this magnet program take a total of eight courses, four courses in Biotechnology and four in the Biomedical Sciences PLTW Program: The highlight of the school is its award-winning Robotics teams 1369 Minotaur, 3846 Aionios Tyfonas, and 4997 Masquerade. All three teams compete against teams from all over the world in the FIRST Tech Challenge. Teams Minotaur and Masquerade won the Florida state championship at Embry-Riddle University on February 18th, 2012. Masquerade was one of only three teams in the state of Florida and the only team in Hillsborough county to earn a spot in the World championship to be held in St. Louis, MO this April, 2012.[9] Middleton's Mu Alpha Theta team is one of the highest-ranked in the nation. In 2007, their team placed ninth in the FAMAT state convention, and seventh in the Mu Alpha Theta National Convention. The school's rival high school is Howard W. Blake High School (Middleton and Blake were the two African-American high schools during segregation). The yearly football game, held at Tampa's Raymond James Stadium, is highly anticipated.[10][11] As of 2010, the Blake vs. Middleton game was held at Blake High School. During the 2009 school year, only 25% of students scored "proficient" on the reading section of the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, while 53% passed Mathematics and 90% passed Writing. The average among the Hillsborough County School District (SDHC) is 61% for Reading, 68% for Mathematics, and 96% for Writing.
