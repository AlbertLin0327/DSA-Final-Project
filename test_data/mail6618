The Mountain Calls (German: Der Berg Ruft) is a film directed by Luis Trenker which recreates in detail the first successful ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865 by Edward Whymper. The film is a remake of Der Kampf ums Matterhorn (The Fight for the Matterhorn) in which Trenker acted in 1928. The Italian mountaineer Jean-Antoine Carrel wants to be the first man to reach the summit of the Matterhorn. He meets the British mountaineer Whymper and they decide to climb together. But due to an intrigue this agreement is dropped and the two men try it on the same day with two different teams, Carrel on the Italian side and Whymper on the Swiss side. The latter will successfully reach the summit along with his six companions, Hudson, Hadow, Douglas and the guides Croz and Taugwalder father and son. Only Whymper and the guides Taugwalder will survive the descent.
