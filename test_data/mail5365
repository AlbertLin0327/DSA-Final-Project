The Harvest Moon video game series was originally produced by Victor Interactive Software (acquired by Marvelous Interactive in 2002), with Natsume handling the English translation and distribution in North America. The series debuted in Japan on August 9, 1996 with Bokuj Monogatari (-, lit. "The Farm Story"?), which later was released in the North American and PAL regions as Harvest Moon.[1] Harvest Moon is a series of farm simulation/role-playing video games where the main objective is to maintain a farm over a period of time, tending the crops and livestock throughout the seasons, while befriending the nearby townsfolk and getting married in some games.[2] Harvest Moon titles have been released on numerous different video game consoles and handheld game consoles. Several titles have been re-released on multiple platforms as special editions which include an updated gameplay.[3] Eleven spin-off titles have been released, featuring related elements. One of these titles, Rune Factory: A Fantasy Harvest Moon, was released to mark the 10th anniversary of the Harvest Moon series.[4] One reason the Harvest Moon series has remained popular is because of the unchanged core system of the games. According to Yasuhiro Wada, Harvest Moon's lead designer, it has been the development team's response to the audience's requests which have allowed the series to maintain its popularity.[5]                         There are 11 spin-off games under the Harvest Moon series featuring related elements or characters.
