Her highest finish on the LET Order of Merit was 15th, also in 2005. Sandolo earned notoriety by publishing a calendar in 2005,[1] in which she posed semi-nude. She has continued to release the calendar every year since. On the topic of the calendar, Sandolo has said, "My first sexy calendar is intended to represent my love for golf, my desire for freedom and a touch of coquetry and Im instinctively attracted by fashion, elegance and glamour."[citation needed] She is often invited on TV shows. She participated in a reality show called The Big Break: Ka'anapali on the Golf Channel.
