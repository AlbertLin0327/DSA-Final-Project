Castanospora is a monotypic genus of tree in the soapberry family Sapindaceae. It is native to the rainforests of southeatern Queensland and northern New South Wales in Australia. It is known to horticulture as the brown tamarind, though it is only distantly related to the true tamarind. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
