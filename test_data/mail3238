Mulgaras are the two species in the genus Dasycercus.[2] They are marsupial carnivores, closely related to the Tasmanian Devil and the quolls, that live in deserts and spinifex bush of central Australia. They are 12.522cm long with a 713cm tail. They are nocturnal but occasionally "sunbathe" in the entrance of the burrow they dwell in. They tend to stay in places that have been in shadow. Their kidneys are highly developed to excrete extremely concentrated urine to preserve water, as the animals never drink. They feed mostly on insects, but also eat lizards and newborn snakes. They breed from June-September and have litters of 6-7 young. The pouch comprises two lateral folds of skin. The genus once contained other species, but they were moved to other genera, leaving only D. cristicauda. Recent research has shown that there are two distinct species, which are very similar. The Brush-tailed Mulgara (D. blythi), synonymous with D. hilleri, has a non-crested tail, two upper premolars, and six nipples. The Crest-tailed Mulgara (D. cristicauda) has a crested tail, three upper premolars, and eight nipples.[3] Much is still to be learned about the mulgaras, such as their social behaviour. The generic name Dasycercus means "hairy-tail."[4]
