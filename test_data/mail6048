83000692 Massasoit Fire House No. 5 is a historic fire station located at 83 Freedom Street in Fall River, Massachusetts. The building was designed by Boston architects Hartwell & Swasey and was built in 1873. This same firm also designed several other fire stations in Fall River during this period, including the Quequechan No. 1, Anawan No. 6 and Pocasset Firehouse No. 7. The building was originally designed to also contain a police station. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It now contains residential apartments.
