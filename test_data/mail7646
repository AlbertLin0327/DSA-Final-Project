Lyari Town (Urdu:   ) is one of the eighteen constituent towns of the city of Karachi, in the province of Sindh, Pakistan. It is the smallest town by area in the city but also the most densely populated town. It is bordered by the towns of SITE Town to the north across the Lyari River, Jamshed and Saddar to the east, and Kiamari to the west across the main harbour of Karachi. Lyari is one of the oldest places in Karachi. There are few schools, substandard hospitals, a poor water system, limited infrastructure, and broken roads. Lyari is a stronghold of ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). Lyari is also the centre of Karachi's African-descended Sheedi community. Ubiquitous gang activity and a thriving narcotics industry make Lyari one of the most disturbed places in Karachi. Lyari is known as a football hotbed in Pakistan. Many of the nation's top players come from the area. Football is so popular that crime levels dip significantly during the FIFA World Cup season. The federal government introduced local government reforms in the year 2000, which eliminated the previous third tier of government (administrative divisions) and raised the fourth tier (districts) to become the new third tier. The effect in Karachi was the dissolution of the former Layari Division and the merger of its five districts to form a new Karachi City-District with eighteen autonomous constituent towns including Lyari Town. Lyari Town is home a large number of Baloch Muslim Communities, such as the Sulemani Baloch, Makrani Baloch, Mandi Baloch, Khosa Baloch, Durrazai Baloch, Broai Baloch, Jadghal Baloch, Mullazai Baloch and many more, the are is also home to other Kutchi Muslim , Gujarati Muslim and Chhipa.
