The Sydney Turf Club (STC) was founded in 1943 and is the youngest of Australia's Principal Race Clubs. It was formed following an Act passed by the New South Wales parliament called the Sydney Turf Club Act. The Act had taken 40 years to draft and gave the club the power to hold 62 race meetings a year at the Rosehill and Canterbury tracks and empowered it to wind up other proprietary clubs that still existed in the Sydney area through a special Racing Compensation Fund. In 2011, the STC merged with the Australian Jockey Club to create the Australian Turf Club. Some of the major races staged by the STC were the Golden Slipper Stakes, Rosehill Guineas and Canterbury Guineas.
