Salvia mairei is a perennial plant that is native to Yunnan province in China. The plant grows on one to a few stems from 20 to 40 cm (7.9 to 16 in) tall. The leaves are cordate-ovate to subhastate-ovate, typically ranging in size from 3.5 to 5 cm (1.4 to 2.0 in) long and 1.8 to 5 cm (0.71 to 2.0 in) wide, though they are sometimes larger. Inflorescences are 4-flowered verticillasters on terminal racemes or panicles that are 8 to 11 cm (3.1 to 4.3 in) long. The corolla is violet or purple, 1.5 to 1.8 cm (0.59 to 0.71 in) long.[1]
