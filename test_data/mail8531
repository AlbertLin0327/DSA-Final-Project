Fools and Worthless Liars is the second album from English pop-punk band Deaf Havana. Fools And Worthless Liars was produced by Matt O'Grady (You Me at Six, Architects) and was released on 6 November 2011.[7] The album marks a departure from the band's earlier post-hardcore style of music in favour of a song orientated power pop approach heavily influenced by bands such as Jimmy Eat World as well as the modern British wave of pop punk. Despite an 18 month struggle to write the album, the majority of "Fools and Worthless Liars" was written and demo'ed in a ten day period at some point in 2010. Recording began on 19 February 2011 and lasted until the album was completed in late summer 2011. 18 songs were recorded for the album. Several earlier written songs played live prior to the album do not feature on the record, the most notable of which is the absence of intended first single "Smiles All Round". However, some songs such as "Little White Lies" (then titled "pop"), "I Will Try" and "Youth In Retrospect" were aired frequently in the live environment. The album charted at Number 49 on the UK album charts. The band are set to tour Europe with Skindred in December 2011 in order to promote the album. All songs written by James Veck Gilodi and Tom Ogden. All Lyrics written by James Veck Gilodi unless specified. The following personnel contributed to Fools And Worthless Liars: Other Musicians: Regular lead guitarist Chris Pennells and bassist Lee Wilson did not perform on the album due to work commitments. The first single "I'm A Bore, Mostly" was released on 9 October 2011.[11] The video for the single was released on 3 October 2011.[12] "Leeches" was the second single released from the album, followed by "Little White Lies".
