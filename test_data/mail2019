The Baldwin-Whitehall School District is a large, suburban public school district which covers the Boroughs of Baldwin and Whitehall and Baldwin Township. Baldwin-Whitehall School District encompasses approximately 10 square miles. According to 2000 federal census data, it serves a resident population of 36,687 people. Per school district officials, in school year 200708 the BWSD provided basic educational services to 4,217 pupils. In 2009, the district residents' per capita income was $21,872 a year, while the median family income was $53,196.[2] Baldwin-Whitehall School District employed 346 teachers, 67 full-time and part-time support personnel, and 13 administrators in 2008. Baldwin-Whitehall School District received more than $16.5million in state funding in school year 200708. The district operates Baldwin High School, Harrison Middle School (6th8th), McAnnulty Elementary School (K-1st), Paynter Elementary School (K-5th) and Whitehall Elementary School (2nd5th). The district is governed by 9 individually elected board members (serve four year terms), the Pennsylvania State Board of Education, the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Pennsylvania General Assembly.[3] The federal government controls programs it funds like Title I funding for low income children in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the No Child Left Behind Act which mandates the district focus resources on student success in acquiring reading and math skills. The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives Sunshine Review gave the Baldwin-Whitehall School Board and school district administration a "D-" for transparency based on a review of "What information can people find on their school district's website". It examined the school district's website for information regarding; taxes, the current budget, meetings, school board members names and terms, contracts, audits, public records information and more.[4] Baldwin-Whitehill School District was ranked 206th in 2011, among 498 Pennsylvania school districts by the Pittsburgh Business Times. The ranking was based on five years of student academic performance on the PSSAs on: math, reading, writing and three years of science.[5] The school district ranked 34th out of 105 western Pennsylvania school districts in 2008 in the Pittsburgh Business Times rating. In 2009, the academic achievement of the students of the Baldwin-Whitehall School District was in the 49th percentile of Pennsylvania's 500 school districts. Scale (099; 100 is state best)[9] In 2010, the Pennsylvania Department of Education issued a new, 4 year cohort graduation rate. Baldwin-Whitehall School District's rate was 94% for 2010.[10] In 2010, the high school is ranked 19th out of 123 western Pennsylvania high schools for student academic achievement on the PSSAs for: reading, writing, math and two years of science by the Pittsburgh Business Times. In 2009, the high school ranked 19th of western Pennsylvania 11th grades.[14] 11th-grade science: College remediation According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 19% of Baldwin-Whitehall School District graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges.[21] Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.[22] Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. The high school offers a Dual Enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books.[23] Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions.[24] For the 200910 funding year, the school district received a state grant of $12,575 for the program.[25] The Baldwin-Whitehall School Board requires the student earn 23 credits to graduate: English  4, Social Science  4, Science  3, Mathematics  4, Physical Education  1, Health  0.5, Arts and/or Humanities  2, Electives  5.50 credits.[26] Graduation project By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district.[27] In 2009, the 8th grade was ranked 68th out of 141 western Pennsylvania middle schools based on three years of results in PSSAs in: reading, math writing and one year of science.[28] (Includes schools in: Allegheny County, Beaver County, Butler County, Fayette County, Westmoreland County, and Washington County In the year 2000 a student brought a shotgun to the school and pointed it point blank at the head of a fellow student. A health teacher tackled this individual in the cafeteria (Mr. Thorn) preventing a murder. This particular teacher directly saved the life of at least one middle-schooler, if not several students including the shooter. This act should not be forgotten, simply because he acted selflessly in the defense of my fellow students. In 2009 and 2010, the school achieved AYP status.[29] The attendance rate was 94% in both 2009 and 2010.[30] In 2010 the school declined to School Improvement level I AYP status due to chronic low student achievement of several student subgroups. In 2009, the school was in Warning status for low student achievement.[36] In 2010 and 2011, the school was eligible for a federal School Improvement Grants which would provide over $1million in extra dollars for improving achievement. 5th Grade Reading: 5th Grade Math: In 2009 and 2010 the school achieved AYP status.[38] In 2010 and 2009 the attendance rate was 95%.[39] 5th Grade Reading: 5th Grade Math: The school achieved AYP for attendance in 2010.[41] In December 2009, the district administration reported that 467 pupils or 11% of the district's pupils received Special Education services.[42][43] In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding.[44] Baldwin-Whitehall School District received a $2,458,688 supplement for special education services in 2010.[45] For 201011 the school received the same funding level. The District Administration reported that 197 or 4.71% of its students were gifted in 2009.[46] By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the students building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility.[47] The Baldwin-Whitehall School Board established a district student wellness policy in 2006  Policy 246.[48] The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108  265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) "shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006." The Superintendent annually reports to the Board on the district's compliance with law and policies related to student wellness. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.[49] The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. In 2007 the district employed 266 teachers. The average teacher salary in the district was $52,597 for 180 days worked.[50] In 2009, the district reported employing over 360 teachers with a salary range of $40,000 to $144,200 for 184 days.[51] Teachers receive a benefits package that includes: health insurance, life insurance, reimbursement for college courses, paid personal days, sick days, paid bereavement leave, and a defined benefits pension.[52] The teachers union has been granted 25 paid days to conduct national, state or local union business. An additional 10 paid days is available to a union member who serves as a state or national officer. The union must pay for a substitute teacher. Added compensation is paid for after school activities, training time, and required meetings. A paid class preparation time is provided daily. The contract stipulates maximum class sizes. Baldwin-Whitehall School District administrative costs per pupil were $676.83 in 2008. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil.[53] Reserves In 2008, the district reported an unreserved designated fund balance of $3,953,626.00 and a unreserved-undesignated fund balance of $4,801,698.00.[54] In 2010, the reserves had increased to an unreserved designated fund balance of $4,788,400 and a unreserved-undesignated fund balance of $7,274,208.[55] In July 2011, the Baldwin-Whitehall School District underwent a performance audit by the Pennsylvania Auditor General. Serious findings were reported to the school board and administration including that a district business office employee had made $298,556 in unauthorized disbursements.[56] In 2009, a payroll clerk was linked to $300,000 missing payroll, athletic and construction funds.[57] The district is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.50%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the income level.[58] In 201112, Baldwin-Whitehall School District will receive $8,796,585 in state Basic Education Funding.[59][60] Additionally, the district will receive $228,878 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget includes $5,354,629,000 for the 20112012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount is a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 20102011. The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011-12.[61] In 2010, the district reported that 1,118 pupils received a free or reduced lunch due to their family meeting the federal poverty level. For the 201011 budget year the Baldwin-Whitehall School District received a 4.57% increase in state basic education funding for a total of $9,228,632.92. South Fayette Township School District received a 11.32% increase, which was the highest increase in state funding among Allegheny County school districts. One hundred fifty school districts in Pennsylvania received the 2% base increase for budget year 201011. Thirty of them were Allegheny County school districts. The highest increase in the state was awarded to Kennett Consolidated School District of Chester County which was given a 23.65% increase in state basic education funding.[62] In the 20092010 budget year the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 6.67% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $9,228,633. Four county school districts received increases of over 6% in Basic Education Funding in 200810. Chartiers Valley School District received an 8.17% increase. The majority of Allegheny County districts received a 2% increase. In Pennsylvania, over 15 school districts received Basic Education Funding increases in excess of 10% in 2009. Muhlenberg School District in Berks County received the highest with a 22.31% increase in funding. The state's Basic Education Funding to the Baldwin-Whitehall School District in 200809 was $8,651,339.27[63] The amount of increase each school district receives is determined by the Governor and the Secretary of Education through the allocation made in the budget proposal made in February each year. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 1,132 students received free or reduced lunches due to low family income in the 20072008 school year.[64] The state provides additional education funding to schools in the form of Accountability Block Grants. The use of these funds is strictly focused on specific state approved uses designed to improve student academic achievement. Baldwin-Whitehall School District uses its $621,231 to fund all day kindergarten for the seventh year and to provide assistance to struggling students. These annual funds are in addition to the state's basic education funding and all federal funding.[65] Schools Districts apply each year for Accountability Block Grants.[66] In 200910, the state provided $271.4million dollars in Accountability Block grants $199.5million went to providing all day kindergartens.[67] The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Mathematics) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 20062009. Baldwin-Whitehall School District did not apply for funding in 200607. In 200708, the district received $475,997 funding. For the 200809, school year the district received a $99,971 for a total funding of $575,968. Of the 501 public school districts in Pennsylvania, 447 of them received Classrooms for the Future grant awards.[68] In the summer of 2011, the district administration again, did not apply for School Improvement Grant funding, from the federal government (over $9.9million available). Whitehall Elemenetary School was eligible for funding due to chronic low achievement. The grant stipulates the funds be used for improving student achievement using one of four federally dictated strategies. The strategies are: transformation, turnaround, restart with new faculty and administration or closure of failing schools. The Pennsylvania Education Secretary awarded $66Million to reform Pennsylvania's lowest achieving schools in August 2011. The funding is for three years.[69] For the 201011 school year, Baldwin-Whitehall School District administration did not apply for a School Improvement Grant. It was eligible for funding due to the chronic, low achievement of subgroups of students, at the Whitehall Elementary School.[70] In 2010, Pennsylvania received $141million from the federal department of education, to turn around its worst-performing schools. The funds were dispersed via a competitive grant program.[71] The Pennsylvania Department of Education has identified 200 Pennsylvania schools as "persistently lowest achieving," making them eligible for this special funding.[72] Pennsylvania required low performing schools to apply or provide documentation about why they had not applied. The funds must be used, by the district, to turn around schools in one of four ways: school closure, restart  close the school and reopen it as a charter school. The other two options involve removing the principal. One would require at least half the faculty in a chronically poor performing school be dismissed. The second involves intensive teacher training coupled with strong curriculum revision or a longer school day.[73] The district received an extra $2,015,610 in ARRA  Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low income students.[74] This funding will be for two years. School district officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district hundreds of thousands of additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement.[75] Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate.[76] Pennsylvania was not approved in the first round of the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. A second round of state RTTT application judging will occur in June 2010.[77] A proposal was made, by David Wassel, a prominent citizen, to consolidate Allegheny County school districts to save tax dollars. focus dollars on student achievement, and improve student services. The plan calls for a proposed district that includes: Brentwood Borough School District, Baldwin-Whitehall School District, Keystone Oaks School District and Mount Lebanon School District. The proposed district would serve the communiities of: Baldwin, Baldwin Township, Brentwood, Castle Shannon, Dormont, Green Tree, and Mt. Lebanon.[78] Governor Edward Rendell proposed that consolidation with adjacent school districts, in each county, would achieve substantial cost savings. The savings could be redirected to improving lagging reading and science achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing residents' property taxes.[79] Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. Less than 95 of Pennsylvania's 501 school districts have enrollment below 1250 students, in 2007.[80] This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity.[81] In a survey of 88 superintendents of small districts, 42% of the respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools.[82] The Baldwin-Whitehall School District School Board participated in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program in 2008. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars.[83] After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. Multiple suggestions for substantial savings were proposed. One example cited was that Baldwin-Whitehall spends almost twice as much as the majority of Allegheny school districts for transportation. In 2010, the Baldwin-Whitehall School Board set the budget for 201011 school year at $62million. The board reduced the real estate tax rate to 23.4 mills. Each mill generates about $1.5million in revenue.[84] A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 20102011 school year is 2.9 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.[87] The School District Adjusted Index for the Baldwin-Whitehall School District 20062007 through 20102011.[88] 200607  4.8%, Base 3.9% 200708  4.3%, Base 3.4% 200809  5.5%, Base 4.4% 200910  5.2%, Base 4.1% 201011  3.7%, Base 2.9% 201112  1.8%, Base 1.4%[89][90] In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases.[91] The property tax relief amount for the Baldwin-Whitehall School District was set at $145 for 11,424 approved applicants by the Pennsylvania Department of Education in May 2010.[92] In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Baldwin-Whitehall School District was $147 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 11,277 property owners applied for the tax relief. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Among Allegheny County school districts, Duquesne City School District received the highest tax relief at $346 in 2009. In Pennsylvania the highest tax relief was given to Chester Upland School District of Delaware County at $632 in 2009.[93] Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Allegheny County, 60% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009.[94] Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, so people who make substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).[95] The district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility to participate is determined by the policies of the Baldwin-Whitehall School Board. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.[96]
