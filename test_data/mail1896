Content:
The 1995 season of the 3. divisjon, the fourth highest association football league for men in Norway. Between 22 and 24 games (depending on group size) were played in 19 groups, with 3 points given for wins and 1 for draws. All group winners were promoted to the Second Division, as well as some of the best runners-up.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
