As If to Nothing is the second independent album by Scottish composer Craig Armstrong, featuring collaborations with Bono of U2, Mogwai, Photek, Evan Dando, King Crimson, and former Big Dish vocalist Steven Lindsay. It was released on 19 February 2002, on the EMI label in the United Kingdom, and Astralwerks in the United States. The song "Finding Beauty" was also covered by the band Escala on their album Escala. The song "Ruthless Gravity" was prominently featured in the 2004 film Layer Cake. The song was also used in an episode of Top Gear when the presenters were racing from Surrey to Monte Carlo in an Aston Martin DB9 and the TGV. The song "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" is a cover of a song of the same name that appears on U2's 1993 album Zooropa, and contains a vocal performance recorded by Bono in 2001 whilst the band were on their Elevation Tour.[2]
