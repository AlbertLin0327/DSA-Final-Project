This article is part of the series: Politics and government of Somalia The Somali Council of Ministers is the Cabinet of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) of Somalia. It consists of high-ranking political officials appointed by the Prime Minister. Then Prime Minister, Nur Hassan Hussein, announced on December 16, 2007 that he had dissolved the cabinet and would form a new one, which would have much fewer ministers than the previous thirty. He also stated half of them would be from outside the transitional parliament.[1] Fifteen ministers and five assistants were appointed on January 4, 2008, with three more ministers to be appointed later. Among the newcomers in the new line-up were several ministers from outside parliament, including the ministers of defence and finance. The country's interior minister, Mohamoud Mohamed Guled, lost his position, while Ahmed Abdi Salan, co-founder of Horn Afrik Media Corporation and a Somali Canadian, was appointed deputy prime minister and information minister.[2] On October 14, 2010, diplomat Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed was appointed the new Prime Minister of Somalia.[3] Per the Transitional Federal Government's (TFG) Charter,[4] the Premier named a new Cabinet on November 12, 2010.[5] As had been expected, the allotted ministerial positions were significantly reduced in numbers, with only 18 administrative posts unveiled versus the previous government's bloated 39 portfolios.[5][6] Only two Ministers from the previous Cabinet were reappointed: Hussein Abdi Halane, the former Minister of Finance and a well-regarded figure in the international community, was put in charge of a consolidated Ministry of Finance and Treasury; and Dr. Mohamud Abdi Ibrahim was reassigned to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.[7] Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a, a moderate Sufi group and an important military ally of the TFG, was also accorded the key Interior and Labour ministries.[6][7] The remaining ministerial positions were largely assigned to technocrats new to the Somali political arena.[8] On June 19, 2011, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed resigned from his position as Prime Minister of Somalia. Part of the controversial Kampala Accord's conditions, the agreement would also see the mandates of the President, the Parliament Speaker and Deputies extended until August 2012, after which point new elections are to be organized.[9] Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, Mohamed's former Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, was later named permanent Prime Minister.[10]
