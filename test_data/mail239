Maryland Route 350 marker Maryland highway system Interstate US State Scenic Byways Turnpikes Maryland Route 350 (MD 350) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known as Mount Hermon Road, the state highway runs 11.80 miles (18.99km) from Main Street in Salisbury east to MD 354 in Powellville. MD 350 provides access to a large area of farmland and forest in southeastern Wicomico County as well as Salisbury-Ocean City Wicomico Regional Airport. The state highway was constructed from Salisbury to Mount Hermon in the 1910s and from Mount Hermon to Powellville in the first half of the 1930s. MD 350 begins as the east leg of a six-way intersection in Salisbury. Main Street, which was formerly U.S. Route 50 (US 50), runs through the intersection from southwest to northeast, while Long Avenue, Truitt Street, and William Street are the south, north, and west prongs of the junction, respectively. MD 350, which is maintained by the city of Salisbury for its first 0.18 miles (0.29km), heads east as a four-lane undivided highway. The state highway parallels the partially controlled access US 50 Business (Salisbury Parkway) on the south and provides access to businesses situated between the two highways.[1][2] After the intersection with Beaglin Park Drive, a county arterial highway on the east side of Salisbury, MD 350 veers away from US 50 Business and reduces to a two-lane road. The state highway passes under US 13 (Salisbury Bypass) with no access and crosses Beaverdam Creek. MD 350 continues through the hamlet of Mount Hermon, where the highway intersects Hobbs Road and Airport Road, which leads to Salisbury-Ocean City Wicomico Regional Airport. The state highway passes through a mix of farmland and forest, traversing Horsebridge Creek, Gate Creek, and Nassawango Creek in succession on the edge of the Wicomico Demonstration Forest, which is accessed via Sixty Foot Road. MD 350 enters Powellville and reaches its eastern terminus at MD 354 (Powellville Road).[1][2] The first portion of MD 350 was constructed between Salisbury and Mount Hermon as a state-aid road by 1915; this highway was improved and brought into the state highway system by 1919.[3][4][5] Work began on the Mount HermonPowellville portion of the highway in 1929.[6] A small segment in Powellville and the section between Mount Hermon and Sixty Foot Road were completed by 1933.[7][8] The gap between Sixty Foot Road and the west end of Powellville was closed in 1935.[9] The entire route is in Wicomico County.
