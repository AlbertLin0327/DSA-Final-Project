The Cab is an American Alternative rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada. Their debut album, Whisper War, was released on April 29, 2008. They have been called "The Band You Need to Know 2008" by Alternative Press magazine. They were also featured in the '100 Bands You Need To Know in 2010' by the magazine and were one of the three bands featured on the cover page, along with Never Shout Never and Hey Monday. Their second album Symphony Soldier was released on August 23, 2011,[1] with its first single "Bad" released to iTunes July 11, 2011[2] and announced by the band on July 18. The Cab funded the entire album by themselves and left their Fueled by Ramen/Decaydance label, self-releasing Symphony Soldier. AbsolutePunk gave an extremely positive review with a rating of 95%, calling the album a "masterpiece."[3] The pre-orders featured eleven packages, ranging from $10 to $9,999 and are now available as packages on the band's webstore.[4][5] Symphony Soldier is digitally available on iTunes,[6] and only available as physical CDs from the band's webstore. Band members Alexander DeLeon and Cash Colligan first began playing music together at Liberty High School (Henderson, Nevada) and recorded demos as a duo which they put up on their MySpace page.[7] At this time, future guitarist Ian Crawford went to school in Auburn, WA and started out playing his guitar in talent shows and getting them put on YouTube. DeLeon asked drummer Alex Johnson, who was playing in a local hardcore band, to join The Cab. In late 2005, it became a full band with guitarist Paul Garcia, guitar/pianist Alex Marshall, and drummer Alex Johnson, playing its first show at The Alley in Las Vegas. The band signed to local label Olympus Records in January 2006[8] but released no material. After giving a demo to Spencer Smith and Jon Walker of Panic! at the Disco at a Cobra Starship/Boys Like Girls/Cartel show,[citation needed] Smith helped them sign to Decaydance Records in May 2007.[9] Shortly after this, the band's members graduated from high school.[10] During this time they decided to replace Garcia with Ian Crawford, who moved from Washington to join the band.[11] In August 2011, The Cab gained a new guitarist, Frank Sidoris, and drummer, Dave Briggs. Blender named them #420 on their Top 100 Hot Report in September 2007, before they released any official material.[12] The group has toured with Panic! at the Disco, We the Kings, Metro Station, Cobra Starship, There For Tomorrow, Charlotte Sometimes, Forever the Sickest Kids, Dashboard Confessional, Plain White Tees, The Hush Sound, and others. In February 2008, their touring van turned over in Wisconsin, but none of the members were seriously injured, and they only missed one tour date.[13] In March 2008, the band played SXSW.[14] Their Matt Squire-produced first album, Whisper War, was released on April 29, 2008, featuring Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco and Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy on "One of Those Nights," co-written by Stump and the first single from the CD.[15][16][17] The video for "One of Those Nights" features members of both Panic! at the Disco and Pete Wentz and Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy. By February 15, 2008, the featured song from the album, "I'll Run", received over 300,000 hits on the band's MySpace page.[18] On October 30, their third single, "Bounce", was revealed in a new music video on the Fueled by Ramen page on YouTube. This song peaked at #69 on the defunct US Billboard Pop 100 chart.[19] On May 7, 2008, Whisper War debuted on the US Billboard 200 at #108,[20] placing it at #1 on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart for new and developing artists.[21] The Cab began the Dance Across the Country Tour with The Hush Sound, Steel Train and The Morning Light on July 7 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The "Why So Serious? Tour" began in September with support from This Providence, Hey Monday and A Rocket to the Moon. In October, they also joined Panic! at the Disco, Dashboard Confessional, and the Plain White T's on the Rock Band Live tour. Their songs "Bounce" and "One of Those Nights" are featured as downloadable tracks in Rock Band 2, although "One of Those Nights" is an alternate version than that of the one on "Whisper War". The Cab has appeared on Punk Goes Pop 2, covering Rihanna's "Disturbia". In February and March 2009 the band toured with We the Kings, There for Tomorrow and Versaemerge on the "Secret Valentine Tour". On May 1, 2009, the band performed an entire set dedicated to Queen.[22] After a short break, they toured with We the Kings, Forever the Sickest Kids, Nevershoutnever! and Mercy Mercedes on the "Bamboozle Road Show Tour". Shortly after, the band announced their first national headlining tour, called the "What Happens In Vegas..." tour, with the support of The Secret Handshake, A Rocket to the Moon, Eye Alaska, Anarbor, The Summer Set, and My Favorite Highway. The tour began on June 18 and ended on August 9. On June 1, 2009 lead singer Alex DeLeon announced on his blog[23] that guitarist Ian Crawford had decided to leave the band. Although DeLeon did say that Crawford had decided to leave due to creative differences, there seemed to be no animosity between him and the band. For their upcoming "What Happens in Vegas..." tour, The Cab announced that their friend Bryan Dawson would be replacing Ian Crawford, who is now the touring guitarist of Panic! at the Disco. On August 19, 2009, bassist Cash Colligan announced that he would also be leaving the band.[24] The news of Colligan's split first appeared on The Cab's official MySpace blog. Colligan's departure, like Crawford's, seemed to be amicable as the band wrote, "We wish him the best and I'm sure he'll be no stranger at a Cab show or anytime we're back in town." The same day Colligan posted his own explanation for leaving the band on his official MySpace blog. He wrote, "I'm proud as a founding member of this band to say the things I've done, the people I've met and the friends I've made. After five years it's time for me to take a mental nap. Being home I can collect my thoughts and move forward." Colligan went on to say that he would be settling down in Las Vegas and that now is just not the right time for him to be touring on the road. In a blog Deleon posted after Cash decided to leave the band he said, "Thank you again to everyone for your unending support, you've made the tour and this summer one we'll never forget. We hope to see everybody again soon. We are happier than ever and have so many songs we are dying to show you guys! Get ready... the best is yet to come." They announced they will be featured in the Alternative Press Tour 2010 and Warped Tour 2010. On January 16, 2010, Alex DeLeon announced via Twitter that "Bryan is going to be a father!". Bryan later confirmed, and confirmed his leave from the band, saying via his own Twitter that he "wanted to thank everyone for the support and love in this crazy time. Love you all now watch out the guys are gonna do great things, promise." A day later, Alex DeLeon announced that The Cab are looking for a new guitar player: "Anyone know any guitar players? serious submissions only. Here is your chance. We need someone who can really play. Big shoes to fill." They were recently featured on "The Real World". The Cab was on the "Ap Tour" in MarchMay 2010. They played songs off Whisper War and are also performed a song, "Locked Up", from their new album. On March 5, Alex DeLeon posted on his Twitter account "singing on the las vegas house of blues stage tonight. it's been too long. been craving the lights. can anyone guess with who?" Later that night he appeared on stage with former Cab bassist Cash Colligan's new band Play For Keeps. DeLeon sang guest vocals on the Play for Keeps song "Just Like the Movies" live, where normally Travis Clark from We the Kings sings on the recording. On June 22, 2011, The Cab announced on their website that they were departing from their label Fueled by Ramen and Decaydance Records before finally releasing their new record, Symphony Soldier. The first single from the record is "Bad," which debuted on Sirius XM Radio. Symphony Soldier was released on August 23, 2011.[1] with its first single "Bad" released to iTunes early July and announced by the band on July 18. AbsolutePunk gave an extremely positive review, calling the album a "masterpiece."[3] The Cab guitarist alumnus Ian Crawford played guitar for the album. It features several guest artists co-writing, including Pete Wentz, Bruno Mars and Adam Levine. The band toured with Simple Plan, Forever The Sickest Kids, and Mariana's Trench in the fall of 2011. The band co-headlined the "Everything's Fine Symphony Soldier" tour during January and February 2012 with best friends The Summer Set. Supporting acts were He Is We, Days Difference, and Paradise Fears.
