The American Forces Press Service (AFPS) is the news service provided by the Defense Media Activity (formerly the American Forces Information Service), part of the United States Department of Defense. It supplies news stories pertaining to the activities of U.S. military forces around the world. All news releases by the AFPS necessarily reflect DOD's policies.
