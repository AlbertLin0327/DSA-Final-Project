The album received critical recognition.[3] David Fricke of Rolling Stone said, "The whole thing is a weird mix folky self-obsession, crackling pop, heavy, metallic sighing but Three Fish is definitely worth, in the words of one song, 'a lovely meander.'"[2] Music videos were made for the songs "Laced" and "Song for a Dead Girl". All songs written and composed by Jeff Ament and Robbi Robb. All songs written and composed by Ament and Robbi Robb.
