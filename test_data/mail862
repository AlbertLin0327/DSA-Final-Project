"The Laughing Policeman" is a music hall song by Charles Jolly, the pseudonym of Charles Penrose. In 1922, Penrose made the first recording of this song, (Columbia Records FB 1184). The composition of the song is officially credited to his wife Mabel under the pseudonym "Billie Grey"; however, the music and melody are taken from The Laughing Song by George W. Johnson which was originally recorded in the 1890s.[1] The Penroses wrote numerous other laughing songs (The Laughing Major, Curate, Steeplechaser, Typist, Lover, etc), but only "The Laughing Policeman" is remembered today, having sold over a million copies. Its popularity continued into the 1970s, as it was a frequently requested recording on the BBC Radio 1 show Junior Choice. It even had a dance mix made of it, which was released on a 10inch 45rpm disc, resembling an old-style 78rpm record, with the original version on the other side. Stikkan Anderson gave the song lyrics in Swedish, as "Den skrattande polisen" ("the laughing police officer"), which was recorded and released in 1955 by Ole Flodin.[2] The song is referenced in the novel and film of the same name: Fictional Swedish detective Martin Beck gets it as a Christmas present from his daughter Ingrid, but doesn't think it is funny. Beck's first laugh after the murder comes when Stenstrm's death is fully vindicated[clarification needed]. The chorus (of the singer laughing) has been used twice as a buzzer on the television panel game QI, and in 2007 for a Cuprinol television advertisement. In The Man who Blew Away, an episode of One Foot in the Grave, the Meldrews are constantly kept awake by a late night party across the road, the worst comes when the partygoers join in the chorus of the song. In an episode of the BBC police drama City Central criminals stole an officer's radio and used it to broadcast the song continuously, disrupting police communications. In the BBC detective drama, Bergerac (TV series), the episode Natural Enemies features the song being played on a gramophone in a children's home, as several children laugh at Charlie Hungerford.
