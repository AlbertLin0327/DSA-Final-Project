Open-Site, the Open Encyclopedia Project, is a free internet encyclopedia founded in 2002 by Michael J. Flickinger in an effort to build a free categorized community-built encyclopedia, inspired by the Open Directory Project. The Open Site software is open source under the Mozilla Public License and the content is free content under the GNU Free Documentation License. The Open-Site encyclopedia uses an ontology based on that of Open Directory Project, of which it is a spin-off. Open-Site has the following main categories, under which most content is organized in several layers of subcategories. In addition to these major topical English categories, the Open-Site encyclopedia also has the following other top-level categories. On the main page of Open Site, it states: "Open-Site is edited by volunteer editors and its content is freely available for everyone under the GNU Free Documentation License." The live pages and an RDF file are both available for public use, provided an appropriate notation of credit is provided. Open-Site lists nine websites that use its data.[1] In August 2004 the Open Site Foundation launched a children's encyclopedia based on the Open Site encyclopedia and the Kids and Teens Open Directory Project. It was formed by a group of editors from both projects. Open-Site Meta Editor and Open Directory Project KCatmv editor lufiaguy originated the idea. The new encyclopedia aims to provide mostly original content written specifically for children. It is currently in the pre-publication production stage. Open Site operates under a charter written by the founders of Open Site when it started in 2002. The key elements of the charter are: October 2, 2007: Michael J. Flickinger releases Open Site 2.0. The new version allows the general public to apply for editing privileges at Open Site. The content is then reviewed by Open Site managers before being published.
