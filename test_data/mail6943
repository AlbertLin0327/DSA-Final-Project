Macroglossum saga is a moth of the Sphingidae family. It is known from Nepal, north-eastern India, southern China, northern Vietnam, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and northern and western Thailand. The single record from the Russian Far East is of a vagrant.[2] The wingspan is 54-66 mm. The head and thorax upperside have a darker mesial streak. The abdomen upperside has two yellow lateral patches, with a further vestigial patch on the second segment and a double series of dark dorsal spots. The thorax underside is greyish wood-brown and the abdomen underside is uniform in colour. The forewing upperside has well contrasted pale and dark areas. Both wing undersides are dark russet, somewhat shaded with grey on the hindwing. Larvae have been recorded on Daphniphyllum macropodum in Korea.
