Paul Scholes (play/pl skolz/; born 16 November 1974) is an English footballer, a one-club man who has played his entire professional career for Manchester United. Born in Salford, but later moving to Langley, Scholes excelled in both cricket and football whilst at school. He first trained with Manchester United at the age of 14 after being spotted by a scout visiting his school, signing for them as an apprentice on leaving school in 1991, and turning professional in 1993. He made his full debut for United in the 199495 season. He went on to play a key part in the club's Treble-winning success in the 1998-99 season, and has won ten Premier League, three FA Cup and two UEFA Champions League winners medals. Scholes represented the England national team from 1997 to 2004, gaining 66 caps and participating in the 1998 and 2002 World Cups, as well as the UEFA Euro 2000 and Euro 2004 tournaments. Cited by some of his footballing peers as one of the best midfielders of his generation, Scholes has also been criticised for his discliplinary record, amassing over 120 bookings in all competitions during his career and being sent off ten times.[3][4][5][6] Scholes has made 689 appearances for United, the third highest number of appearances by any player for the club. Scholes officially announced his retirement from playing duties on 31 May 2011 and began his coaching career at the club from the 201112 season onward. Scholes reversed this decision on 8 January 2012, to play for the club until the end of the 201112 season. Scholes was born at Hope Hospital in Salford, Greater Manchester, to parents Stewart and Marina Scholes. The family moved to Langley area of Middleton, Greater Manchester when he was 18 months old where he lived on Bowness Road, and later Talkin Drive.[7] He attended the St Mary's RC Primary School in Langley. The first team he played for was Langley Furrows. Scholes also excelled at cricket. At age 14, he began training with Manchester United.[8] He then later joined as a trainee upon leaving the Cardinal Langley Roman Catholic High School in Middleton during the summer of 1991.[7] In his final term at school, he was selected to represent Great Britain National Schools in football. Scholes was not a member of Manchester United's 1992 FA Youth Cup-winning squad that included future senior teammates David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs, but he was part of the youth team that reached the final in the following season, alongside Phil Neville.[9] Scholes turned professional on 23 July 1993 and was issued with the number 24 shirt, but did not make his breakthrough into the senior squad until the 199495 season, when he made seventeen league appearances and scored five goals. His debut came on 21 September 1994, where he scored both goals in a 21 victory over Port Vale in the Football League Cup. His league debut came three days later against Ipswich Town at Portman Road, a game which United lost 32 and Scholes scored a consolation goal. He scored two league goals came on 10 December when United beat QPR 32 at Loftus Road. On 3 January 1995, he got onto the scoresheet at Old Trafford for the first time with the opener in a 20 league win over Coventry City. He scored once more that season, in a 32 away win over Coventry City on 1 May.[10] Scholes came on as a substitute in the 1995 FA Cup final against Everton, which United lost 10. He came close to scoring twice late in the game, only to be foiled by Neville Southall both times. In 199596, after Mark Hughes moved to Chelsea, Scholes had more first-team opportunities, standing in for the suspended Eric Cantona as Andrew Cole's strike partner for the first two months of the campaign. Scholes (now wearing the number 22 shirt) scored fourteen goals in all competitions as United became the first English team to win the double twice.[11] He picked up another Premier League winners medal in 199697 - in this season he changed his shirt number to 18, which he held for the next 15 years. In the 1996 close season, when United unsuccessfully tried to sign Alan Shearer from Blackburn Rovers, the Ewood Park club reportedly demanded that United should offer Scholes in exchange if any bid for Shearer from United was to be considered. By this stage, Scholes was rated at 5million, and Blackburn had already rejected a part-exchange deal involving 7million-rated Andy Cole.[12] However, Shearer never came to Old Trafford, instead joining Newcastle United for 15million.[13] After Roy Keane suffered a knee injury in late September 1997 and was ruled out for the season, Scholes moved to central midfield in the 199798 season. However, United finished the season without a major trophy, only the second time in the 1990s that this happened.[14] In 199899, Scholes was a key player in Manchester United's Premier League title, FA Cup, and UEFA Champions League Treble success. He scored one of Manchester United's two goals against Newcastle in the FA Cup final. He also scored an away goal against Internazionale in the Champions League quarter-final. He came on as a substitute in the second leg of the semi final against Italian club Juventus[15] as Sir Alex Ferguson opted for Nicky Butt in the starting line up. He picked up a yellow card which ruled him out of the final victory over Bayern Munich through suspension.[16] In 200102, Manchester United completed the signing of Argentine international Juan Sebastin Vern.[17] In order to accommodate Scholes and Veron, Ferguson persisted with the 4411 formation, which saw Scholes playing at the withdrawn striker role behind Ruud van Nistelrooy as Roy Keane and Veron played in central midfield.[18] In European away fixtures, Scholes was often played in central midfield alongside Veron as Keane anchored.[19] However, Scholes failed to adapt to the system and his form suffered. Scholes netted a career-high twenty goals in all competitions in the 200203 season, a number that dipped to fourteen the next year. This was despite a career-best four FA Cup goals, in comparison to his total of five FA Cup goals scored in his first nine seasons. He helped Manchester United reach the 2005 FA Cup Final but saw his penalty saved by Jens Lehmann as they lost to Arsenal in a penalty shootout. He was ruled out for the second half of the 200506 campaign with blurred vision. The cause of this was initially uncertain, sparking fears that it could end his career. He overcame this problem through the beginning of the year and he appeared in Manchester United's final game of the season against Charlton Athletic. Reportedly, Scholes' vision has not completely recovered.[20] On 22 October 2006, in the 20 Premier League victory over Liverpool, Scholes became the ninth United player to play in five hundred matches, joining Bobby Charlton, Bill Foulkes, and current teammate Ryan Giggs.[21] Scholes was dismissed during Manchester United's 10 away victory over Liverpool on 3 March 2007, for swinging an arm at Xabi Alonso. It marked his first league expulsion since April 2005.[22] A month later, he was sent off in the first leg of Manchester United's Champions League quarter final at A.S. Roma. On 23 August 2007, he was shortlisted for a place in the English Football Hall of Fame, which ultimately went to Dennis Bergkamp as voted for by Football Focus viewers.[23] Scholes suffered knee ligament damage during a training session the night before Manchester United's Champions League Group F matchup with Dynamo Kiev on 23 October 2007, and was out of action until the end of January 2008. He returned as a substitute in Manchester United's 31 win over Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth round of the FA Cup. On 23 April 2008, Scholes made his hundredth Champions League appearance in a semi-final 00 draw at FC Barcelona, and scored the only goal in a 10 victory in the second leg that sent United into the final.[24] During the final against Chelsea, he suffered an injury and received a yellow card after a clash with Claude Makll; he was substituted in the 87th minute and did not take part in the penalty shoot-out that was won 65 by United after a 11 extra-time draw.[25] Scholes was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in September 2008[26][27] In a December 2008 interview with The Daily Mirror, he said he planned to retire from football completely in two years. "I think I've got two years left at the most [...] I'm looking forward to finishing and everything that goes with it."[28] On 22 April 2009, he made his 600th appearance for Manchester United in a 20 win over Portsmouth.[29] On 16 February 2010, Scholes scored his third Champions League goal of the season against Milan in a 32 win; it was also United's first ever away goal against Milan. This gave United their first ever away win over Milan and also made Scholes the first ever player to score against both Internazionale and Milan at the San Siro in the Champions League.[30] On 6 March 2010, Scholes became the 19th player in Premier League history to score 100 goals and also the third United player after Ryan Giggs and Wayne Rooney to do so in the 200910 season, netting the only goal in a 10 win over Wolves at Molineux.[31] On 16 April 2010, Scholes signed a new one-year contract with United, keeping him at the club until the end of the 201011 season.[32] Scholes began the 201011 season strongly, displaying Man of the Match performances against Chelsea in the 2010 Community Shield on 8 August[33] and eight days later in the opening fixture of the new league campaign against Newcastle United as he assisted two goals in a 30 home victory.[34] Scholes scored his 150th goal for Manchester United in a 22 away draw against Fulham on 22 August;[35] he was also awarded the Premier League Player of the Month for August 2010.[36] In April 2011, Scholes was sent off for a high challenge on Pablo Zabaleta in the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City; Manchester United went on to lose the fixture 10.[37] He announced his retirement on 31 May 2011, with immediate effect, and joined the coaching staff at Manchester United.[38] On 5 August 2011, United held a testimonial match to honour his 17 years of service to United. The match was played at Old Trafford against New York Cosmos.[39][40] United won the match 60, with Scholes opening the scoring with a trademark strike from 25 yards out. On 8 January 2012, Scholes reversed his decision to retire because of the injury crisis in the Manchester United squad and made his return as a substitute during a 32 win, against neighbours Manchester City in the FA Cup.[41] His customary number 18 shirt occupied by Ashley Young, Scholes wore the number 22 which he had last worn during the 199596 season as he replaced Nani in the 59th minute.[42] He made his first start in the next game against Bolton Wanderers, where he scored his first goal since returning in a 30 victory at Old Trafford, converting a Wayne Rooney pass; this meant he had scored at least one goal in every season in the Premier League since 199495.[43] He scored his second goal since coming back in a 2-1 away win against Norwich City on 26 February, heading home a cross from Nani.[44] On 8 April he scored in a 2-0 win against Queens Park Rangers at Old Trafford, helping Manchester United to go eight points clear of rivals Manchester City in the Premier League.[45] On 30 May, Scholes signed a one-year extension with Manchester United, keeping him at the club until 2013.[7] Scholes made his international debut against South Africa in 1997 in a 21 friendly win at Old Trafford, and was included in the England squad for the 1998 World Cup. England were grouped with Colombia, Tunisia and Romania. During England's first World Cup group match against Tunisia, Scholes sealed a 20 victory with a goal late in the game. His international career continued after England's elimination from the World Cup by Argentina on penalties in the first knock-out round. On 27 March 1999, Scholes managed a hat-trick for England in a game against Poland. In addition, Scholes scored both goals in England's 20 win at Hampden Park over Scotland in the Euro 2000 play-off first leg, sealing a 21 aggregate win and qualification for the finals tournament. In a qualifier against Sweden that June, Scholes became the first and last England player to be sent off in an international match at the old Wembley Stadium.[8] With the turn of the century, Scholes became a prominent player in England's midfield, becoming a first-choice selection for the 2002 World Cup. However, after the tournament, Scholes saw his opportunities in the national team decline due to Sven-Gran Eriksson playing him out of position on the left midfield to accommodate the pairing of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard in central midfield.[46] Scholes announced his retirement from international football in August 2004, citing his family life and his club career with Manchester United as being more important.[47] In July 2006, following Eriksson's departure, there was talk of Scholes making himself available for international duty again under new manager Steve McClaren, but nothing ever came of it.[48] In May 2010, McClaren's successor Fabio Capello approached Scholes about a return to international football in the run-up to the 2010 World Cup, but the player rejected the offer saying he'd prefer to spend time with his family.[49] On 7 June 2010, Scholes revealed had Capello given him more time and had asked earlier then he would have probably taken the opportunity.[50] On 27 July 2010, Scholes then revealed his disappointment in not taking the opportunity to play at another World Cup, saying he may have made a mistake.[51] Over his career, Scholes received 90 yellow and 4 red cards in the Premier League, making him the third most booked player in Premier League history[3][5] He was also been booked 32 times in the Champions League, more than any other player in the competition.[4][5] Scholes' tackling has drawn criticism from figures in the game such as Arsne Wenger who stated "for me he was not a fair player. Theres a little bit of a darker side in him, sometimes, that I did not like. I respect him highly as a quality player but I did not like some things he did on the football pitch".[52] Thierry Henry said, "Without any doubt the best player in the Premiership has to be Scholes... He knows how to do everything."[53] When asked about Scholes, Bobby Charlton stated, "Paul is always so in control and pin-point accurate with his passing  a beautiful player to watch",[54] whilst Marcello Lippi remarked that Scholes is "an all-round midfielder who possesses quality and character in abundance."[55] BBC football pundit and former Liverpool defender Alan Hansen has described Scholes as "one of the top three to five players to have ever played in the Premier League" and commented "his passing, movement and technique set examples to everyone."[56] Manchester United team mate Nani commented "hes the best midfielder Ive ever seen. He can pass, score goals with his left, right, his head  he can do anything."[57] The one aspect of his game frequently criticised was his tackling, which was recognised as inept by pundits, fans and Scholes himself.[58][59][60] In addition, the potential for malicious intent in some of his tackles has been raised;[61] it has been suggested that he has escaped greater censure due to the admiration that pundits have for him.[62] However, Scholes said in an interview after his retirement that the tackles were to get back at players who had fouled him earlier in the game and the infamy surrounding his tackles led to him often being unnecessarily booked.[63] In February 2011, Barcelona midfielder Xavi rated Scholes as the best player in his position in the past two decades, stating "A role model. For me, and I really mean this, he's the best central midfielder I've seen in the last 15, 20 years. He's spectacular, he has it all, the last pass, goals, he's strong, he doesn't lose the ball, vision. If he'd been Spanish he might have been rated more highly. Players love him."[64] This sentiment was echoed by FC Barcelona manager, Josep Guardiola, who considered Scholes to be the best midfielder of his generation.[65] And also former France star Zinedine Zidane said One of my regrets is that the opportunity to play alongside him never presented itself during my career.[66] Scholes is asthmatic[67] and suffered from OsgoodSchlatter disease,[68] a knee condition that affects young athletes. He married his childhood sweetheart,[69] Claire (ne Froggatt),[69] in Wrexham in February 1999,[70] and they live in Saddleworth[71] with their three children, Arron, Alicia and Aiden,[72] who is autistic.[73] As of August 2011, Arron Scholes plays for the Stalybridge Celtic under-12s football team.[74] Scholes' personality off the field has been described as "shy"[75] and his lifestyle is seen to be in stark contrast to the lifestyles of the stereotypical professional footballer.[76] In a rare interview before Euro 2004, Scholes described his ideal day as "train in the morning, pick up my children from school, play with them, have tea, put them to bed and then watch a bit of TV."[71]  Statistics accurate as of match played 6 May 2012.[77] [78][79]  Template:200203 Premier League PFA Team of the Year
