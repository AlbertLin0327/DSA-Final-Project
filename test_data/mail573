Fanweyn (Somali: Faan Weyn) is a town in the Gedo region of Somalia. It is located in the southwestern part of the country. Fanweyn is situated roughly half way between Bardera and Burdhubo, in the Baardheere District. The town is in the Jubba Valley and sits on a rocky area. Salty springs from rain waters fall on the western part of the Gogol mountain range. There is one particular spring near the city, where people with various ailments come to drink for better health. Travelers from Luuq, Bardera, and as far east as Mogadishu, used come to Fanweyn to drink the salt waters for internal body cleansing. Overweight individuals and people with digestive problems used to drive all the way from Kismayo in the far south for this purpose. The salty waters are drinkable only during gu season, which lasts from April to June. The rest of the year, the waters turn into pure salt.
