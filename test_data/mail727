Ralph & Russo is a luxury couture house that specialises in bespoke evening, bridal, cocktail and red carpet wear. The brand was founded in 2007 by Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo.[1] Each Ralph & Russo gown is chosen from hand-drawn sketches and made the traditional couture way out of their London based atelier. Their couturiers drape, cut and pin the gowns to the body then bead, embellish and sew the garments individually by hand. Every Ralph & Russo gown is made-to-measure and can take hundreds of hours and up to 30 pairs of hands to create.[2] Ralph & Russo has many fans among well-known celebrities which include Beyonce, Angeline Jolie, Eva Longoria, Penelope Cruz, Kelly Brook and Elizabeth Hurley all of which have had bespoke pieces designed by the brand.[3].[4] In 2008, Ralph and Russo designed the wedding dress of Chelsea and German international football captain Michael Ballack's fiance Simone Lambe.[5] In August 2010, NBC's Access Hollywood star Maria Menounos wore a custom made $35,000 Ralph & Russo couture gown covered in more than 15,000 Swarovski crystals to the 62nd Annual Emmy Awards. [6] In September 2010, Harrods department store announced the launch of an exlcusive range of Ralph & Russo couture gowns. Harrods became the first and only store worldwide to stock the brand and showcases the designs both on the shop floor and within their By Appointment rooms.[7] Ralph & Russo bespoke designs are regularly featured on two of the largest UK television programs, Britains Got Talent and The X Factor. Both Dannii Minogue and Amanda Holden frequently wear custom made gowns from the designers throughout the live shows.[8][9]
