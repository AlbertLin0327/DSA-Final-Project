Club Disco is the fifth studio album by Australian singer Dannii Minogue. It was released by All Around the World as a digital download on 5 November 2007.[1] A double disc was released in Australia on 27 May 2008 which included a bonus CD of remixes and "Touch Me Like That" as the first track. The heavily 80s disco inspired album had six singles, "You Won't Forget About Me", "Perfection", "So Under Pressure", "I Can't Sleep at Night", "He's the Greatest Dancer" and "Touch Me Like That" five of which, reached number one on the UK Dance Chart. After the success of her previous album Neon Nights, Minogue was asked by All Around the World Records, a major dance label, if she would write the lyrics to a popular dance instrumental track called "Flower Power", which was a huge hit in clubs in Ibiza. Minogue agreed and wrote the lyrics to the song that would soon become "You Won't Forget About Me". About writing lyrics for the song Minogue said: "I'd heard it without vocals and I thought, 'Fantastic'. I had already written loads of vocals for myself and knew I had something that would be perfect for it." In 2005, Minogue began writing and recording material with long time collaborator Terry Ronald and British dance group LMC. During one of their sessions, they penned "So Under Pressure", which was inspired by the cancer diagnoses of her sister Kylie as well as that of an unnamed friend. Minogue has described the recording of "So Under Pressure" as a "real achievement" as she was "brave enough to put all [her feelings] into words".[2] The working title for the album was Heavy Disco after the line in the song "Feel Like I Do". After eight of the tracks from the Heavy Disco sessions were included on Minogue's compilation The Hits & Beyond plus two b-sides on the singles 'Perfection and 'So Under Pressure, the title was changed and the tracks were also later included on Club Disco. All bonus footage appears on the 7digital bundle version of Club Disco.
