The eucalyptus tree Eucalyptus patens has been known as yarri, blackbutt, Swan River blackbutt and Western Australia blackbutt. It is similar to the jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) and it is usually found in jarrah forests alongside this tree. It is endemic to the southwest of Western Australia. It is in short supply as a harvestable timber [1] and due to its prevalence in old growth forests has been identified as a timber not to be utilised unless it is salvaged [2] It is a viable tree to cultivate - and numbers of publications and websites have clear information on cultivation well away from its normal habitat [3] 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
