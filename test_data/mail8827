The Injustice to Dou E ( Dou E Yuan), also known as The Injustice Done to Tou Ngo and Snow in Midsummer, is a Chinese drama by Guan Hanqing written during the Yuan Dynasty. It remains one of Guan's most popular works. The story describes the young widow Dou E from Chouzhou () whose husband Cai () died two years after marrying. Dou was wrongfully accused by Zhang Lr (, literally "The Mule Zhang") of the murder of his father, when Dou E refused to marry Zhang Lr. Before her execution (scene:  "Zhai Dou E"), Dou E swore that her innocence would be proven when: All three, including the eerie "Snow in June" (scene:  "Liu Yue Xue") did occur. After the ghost of Dou E revealed the injustice to her father - Dou Tianzhang (), who eventually became a liangjunliefangshi inspector () - Inspector Dou killed the corrupt officials and Zhang Lr. The story was repeatedly used and modified by later dramatists.
