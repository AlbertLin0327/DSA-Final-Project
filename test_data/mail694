The Carolina, Knoxville and Western Railway was a South Carolina railroad that existed in the latter half of the 19th century. The Carolina, Knoxville and Western Railway was formed in 1887.[1] The company was consolidated in 1887, with the Carolina, Knoxville and Western Railway Company, the Pennsylvania and Haywood Railroad Company and the Atlantic, Greenville and Western Railway Company joining under the Carolina, Knoxville and Western Railway moniker.[2] The newly formed company was to build a line from Augusta, Georgia, to Knoxville, Tennessee. About 14 miles of rail was laid between Greenville, South Carolina, and Marietta, South Carolina,[3] and considerably more grading completed before work was suspended after the failure of the Georgia Construction and Investment Co., which had the contract to construct the entire road.[4] A receiver was appointed for the Carolina, Knoxville and Western Railway in 1891, and in 1899 the portion of the property to which reference has already been made was conveyed by deed to the carrier.[5] The Carolina, Knoxville and Western Railway was unsuccessful and the line was abandoned sometime after 1899, until 1907, when the Greenville and Knoxville Railroad was formed to reopen the route.[6] In 1914 the railroad once again reorganized, this time as the Greenville and Western Railroad. It was renamed the Greenville and Northern six years later. The line was purchased by the Pinsly Railroad Company in 1957.[7]
