The Good Book Press was a fine press book publisher, founded in 1977 by Peter and Donna Thomas of Santa Cruz, California. The proprietors produced the books by hand. Peter R. Thomas (aka Peter Papermaker) made the paper and Donna Thomas illustrated the books predominately with linoleum cuts. The Thomases handset the type, letterpress printed the books, and bound the books by hand. Many of their works were sold at the California Renaissance Fair. The Good Book Press specialized in miniature books, often fairy tales or fables. Many were original texts by Peter Thomas. The Good Book Presss final work was their 1987 edition of poet William Eversons eulogy for the death of Robinson Jeffers, titled The Poet is Dead. The introduction of personal computers revolutionized production of fine press books. Artists from different media began to explore the books as art. In 1988, declaring that they were no longer publishers, but rather artists working in the medium of the book, Peter and Donna dropped the Good Book Press imprint and began creating their books under their new imprint: Peter and Donna Thomas: Santa Cruz.
