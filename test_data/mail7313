Pahari painting (literal meaning a painting from the mountainous regions, pahar means a mountain in Hindi) is an umbrella term used for a form of Indian painting, originating from Himalayan Hill kingdoms of North India, during 17th-19th century. Notably Basohli, Mankot, Nurpur, Chamba, Kangra, Guler, Mandi, and Garhwal, and was done mostly in miniature forms.[1][2] The Pahari school developed and flourished during 17th-19th centuries stretching from Jammu to Almora and Garhwal, in the sub-Himalayan India, through Himachal Pradesh, and each creating stark variations within the genre, ranging from bold intense Basohli Painting, originating from Basohli in Jammu and Kashmir, to the delicate and lyrical Kangra paintings, which became synonymous to the style before other schools of paintings developed, which reached its pinnacle with paintings of Radha and Krishna, inspired by Jayadev's Gita Govinda.[3] It gave birth to a new idiom in Indian painting, and grew out of the Mughal painting, though this was patronized mostly by the Rajput kings who ruled many parts of the region.[4]
