Dean Lance Morgan (born 3 October 1983) is an English footballer who plays as a striker or winger. Morgan started his career with Colchester United, but left in September 2003, having his contract cancelled by mutual consent.[1] He joined Reading in November 2003, before being released at the end of the 200405 season. He joined Luton Town in the summer of 2005. Morgan started well, scoring a late winner against Southampton on his first home appearance for the Hatters. Despite interest from other teams,[citation needed] Morgan signed a new deal at Luton on February 16, 2007, keeping him at Luton until the summer of 2009.[2] On 16 November 2007, Morgan signed on loan for Southend United until January 2008.[3] He scored three goals for Southend, all of which came in the FA Cup in games against Oxford United (scoring once)[4] and Dagenham & Redbridge (scoring twice).[5] On 3 January 2008, Leeds United manager Dennis Wise confirmed that Morgan was one of his transfer targets in the transfer window,[6] but Morgan remained at Luton as Leeds would not meet his wage demands, despite Luton being willing to release him on a free transfer.[7] This was not the first time Wise had attempted to bring Morgan to Leeds, having also tried to sign him during the 200607 season. On 7 March 2008 Morgan signed for Crewe Alexandra on loan for the rest of the season,[8] where he scored once against Gillingham.[9] Morgan was contracted to Luton until the end of the 200809 season, but never made another first-team appearance for the Hatters. On 29 August 2008, Morgan joined Leyton Orient on loan until January 2009,[10] later extended to the end of the season. He played 34 games for the O's from left midfield, scoring five goals. Morgan was released on a free transfer by Luton on 27 May 2009.[11] Subsequently he signed for Conference National club Grays Athletic on 10 August.[12] Morgan made just two appearances for Grays, scoring once against Tamworth[13] before being released. In September 2009, Morgan joined Milton Keynes Dons on trial,[14] before signing on non-contract terms.[15] Morgan scored his first goal for the club in a 21 win over former club Leyton Orient on 12 December 2009,[16] and followed this up with his second goal against Premier League side Burnley in the FA Cup on 2 January 2010.[17] On 25 March 2010, Morgan signed for Aldershot Town on loan, until the end of the season.[18] He scored his first goal for Aldershot Town in the 30 win over Rotherham United on the 5 April. He was released by MK Dons when his contract expired at the end of the season.[19] Despite being offered a contract by Aldershot he decided to sign for Chesterfield. On 8 March 2012, Morgan signed on loan for League Two side Oxford United. He came on as a substitute to make his debut against Bradford City at Valley Parade, in which they lost 21. He was released by Chesterfield at the end of the 201112 season.[20]
