Kendall is a suburban neighborhood of metropolitan Miami, Florida, United States. As of the 2000 census, the area had a total population of 75,226. While the defined boundaries of the community have been labeled Kendall by the US Census Bureau, locals often included western communities, such as The Hammocks, Country Walk, The Crossings, Kendale Lakes, Kendall West, and Three Lakes, subdivisions of Kendall. According to the census, Kendall is home to over 11,000 Colombian Americans, one of the largest populations in the United States. Kendall is served by the Miami Metrorail at Dadeland North and Dadeland South stations. Both stations provide service from Dadeland to Downtown Miami, and Miami Central Station at Miami International Airport in 2012. Dadeland South station is a major transit depot in the area, connecting the southernmost suburbs of Homestead and Florida City to Metrorail via limited-stop bus rapid transit along the South Miami-Dade Busway. Much of what is now Kendall was purchased from the State of Florida in 1883 by the Florida Land and Mortgage Company. Originally known as Rockdale, it was renamed for Henry John Broughton Kendall, a director of Florida Land and Mortgage who moved to the area in the 1900s to manage the company's land. As the land was not open to homesteading, development was slow well into the 20th century. A post office opened in 1914, and the first school opened in 1929. After the end of the land boom in 1926, some residents left. Two Seminole camps were in the Kendall area, and Seminoles continued to live there into the 1940s.[3] Kendall is located at 25400N 802124W / 25.666667N 80.35667W / 25.666667; -80.35667 (25.666781, -80.356533)[4].
