The Mocho-Choshuenco National Reserve is a natural reserve around the Mocho-Choshuenco volcano, in Los Ros Region, southern Chile. The reserve was created by decree in march 1994 and covers 7,537ha (18,620 acres) distributed in Panguipulli, Los Lagos and Futrono municipality. The principal access goes from the Pan American Highway to Enco passing by Panguipulli and Choshuenco. From Enco a small way goes to the refuge area, during the summer months tracked vehicles can come there. Mocho-Choshuenco National Reserve has no park guards or any public infrastructure. In the refuge sector there is a mountain hut leased to Los Lagos municipality, some old military buildings ruins, and the rests of a small ski centre.
