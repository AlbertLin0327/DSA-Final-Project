Locomotor activity (LMA) refers to the movement from place to place. In psychopharmacology, locomotor activity of lab animals is often monitored to assess the behavioural effects of these drugs. Locomotor activity is useful and less robust than most behavioural tests such as operant conditioning and radial arm maze. It is often used in primary evaluations of drugs.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
