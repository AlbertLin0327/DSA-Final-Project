Dolly ki Ayegi Baraat is a Pakistani comedy-drama and the sequel of hit drama Azar Ki Ayegi Baraat.[1] It is based on Evernew's popular storyline of Kis Ki Ayegi Baraat. The show includes most of the characters from Azar Ki Ayegi Baraat, and focuses on the story of Azar's cousin Dolly and Sila's friend Nabeel. Unlike the first serial in the series, which was written by Mohammad Ahmed, Dolly ki Ayegi Baraat was written by Bushra Ansari and Vasay Chaudry. Also, the character of Sila, previously played by Sarwat Gilani, was played by Ayesha Omar. The serial premiered on GEO TV in August 2010 & consisted on 17 episodes ending in September 2010. Dolly ki Ayegi Baraat is set in Faisalabad and Karachi, focusing on Dolly, Azar's cousin and Nabeel, Sila's friend. This is the sequel to Azar ki ayegi baraat. At the end of Azar ki Ayegi Baraat, Nabeel and Dolly are shown flirting with each other. However in this drama, Dolly is being married to her maternal aunt's son, Mushtaq known as Taka and Nabeel is being married to a girl named Saima who he has never met before. Both of them show indirect reluctance to their weddings but don't object. However, in their hearts, Dolly and Nabeel are set for one another and love each other a lot. In the beginning Nabeel is not shown since he wants to forget Dolly as told afterwards and this would only be possible if he stops meeting Sila. However, in the 4th episode Nabeel and Dolly meet in a mall by mistake in Karachi where Dolly has come for her mom's fashion week. There Sila and her friend Laila also meet him and then their friendship continues. During this time Nabeel and Dolly realize that they still love each other but they don't show it and always end up fighting. Then Dolly has to go back to Faisalabad as her wedding is now taking place a month before it actually should. Then during his nikkah, Nabeel rejects the wedding and goes off to Faisalabad to convince Dolly to marry him. She tells him that she still loves him but now it's too late. In the end Dolly's mom realizes that Dolly is just marrying Mushtaq for her sake so she marries her off to Nabeel. Everyone is happy since even Mushtaq loved Sila's friend Sukaina, frequently known as Sukki. In the background of the drama, Dolly's mom Saima Choudhry is trying to hook her son Vicky, who is separated, with Sila's friend Laila even though both are unwilling. Choudhry Sahab, Saima's husband marries off to a Faisalabadi actress Malika Rani over which Saima Choudhry is very upset and makes a big fuss. Azar and Sila are also facing problems in their marriage because Sila thinks Azar has an affair with his boss which actually is untrue. Sila is pregnant and so is her mom Rabbiya which creates a long term fight between both mom and daughter. Sukki is also facing problems with her fiance over her weight and her fiance is rude and strict. In the middle when Rabbiya decides to get an abortion there is a very short fight between her and Faraz, her husband. In the end, everything is resolved and the ending is happy. Dolly ki Ayegi Baraat was widely appreciated by both critics and the general audience. In a poll by Dawn News, Dolly ki Ayegi Baraat was rated as the best drama of 2010. The official soundtrack consisted of two songs sung by Shazia Manzoor, with music by Shoaib Mansoor. The title song "Ballay Ballay",[2] a bhangra song featured in episode 16 of the drama, was on the Mayoon of Dolly in Faisalabad, with the entire guests of the wedding including Malka Rani performing on it. The second song titled "Kalyaan Bagan Di Mehndi"[3] was featured in episode 15 of the episode during the Mehndi function of Dolly's wedding immediately after the patch up of both Rabia & Sila with themselves & their husbands.
