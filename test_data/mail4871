"Target" is a song by British rock band Embrace and is featured on their number-one charting fifth album, This New Day. It was released 11 September 2006 as the follow-up to the band's official World Cup 2006 Anthem. It didn't repeat the top 3 success of their two recent singles from their album, peaking at #29 in the UK Singles Chart.
