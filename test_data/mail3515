The Strait of Baltiysk is a strait in Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia, enabling passage from the Baltic Sea into the Vistula Lagoon. It separates the Sambian Peninsula and Vistula Spit. The strait is the main connection from the open sea to the important ports of Baltiysk and Kaliningrad in Russia, as well as to the Polish ports of Elblg, Braniewo, Tolkmicko, Frombork, Sztutowo, Krynica Morska, and Nowa Paska.[1] The strait was dug in 1497. In 1960s it was expanded and now it measures 400 m width and 12 m depth. Since 1990s Russia periodically blocks navigation via the strait (both for Poland and Russia). Since 2006, Poland has considered digging another canal across the Vistula Spit in order to circumvent this lack of access.[1] Coordinates: 543828N 195242E / 54.64111N 19.87833E / 54.64111; 19.87833
