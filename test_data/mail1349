Arcade's Greatest Hits: The Atari Collection 2 is a compilation of four Midway arcade games: Gauntlet, Marble Madness, Paperboy, and RoadBlasters. It also includes Crystal Castles and Millipede from Atari. The compilation contains artwork and info on each game, and all games are presented in their original format.
