The San Francisco Unified School District is one of twenty five full-choice enrollment systems in the United States that allows parents and students to select their schools of choice in a required district application. Calfee School Guide was the first community program of its kind in the United States to provide school-based curricula for public middle school students to learn about the process of selecting and applying to public, magnet and public-charter high schools. The San Francisco Unified School District became a full-choice enrollment district due to the historic mandate resulting from the 1994 lawsuit Ho v. SFUSD. This lawsuit was filed in response to the 1979 suit NAACP v. SFUSD that settled in a 1983 consent decree that integrated public schools in San Francisco. The 1979 case set a precedent that required schools not to exceed 45% of any race/ethnicity in one location. Students were bused from home districts to schools in other districts to offset racial majorities. District parents Carl Ho, Charlene Wong Loen, and Jane Chen filed the 1994 lawsuit charging the school district and the NAACP of discriminating against their children based on race.
