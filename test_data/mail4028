The 192425 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team represented Princeton University in intercollegiate college basketball during the 192425 NCAA men's basketball season. The head coach was Albert Wittmer and the team captain was Stephen Cleaves.[1] The team played its home games in the University Gymnasium on the university campus in Princeton, New Jersey.[2] The team was the winner of the Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League (EIBL) and is considered the retroactive national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation.[1][3] The team posted a 212 overall record and a 91 conference record. Its only two losses came in road games against Westminster College[disambiguation needed] by a 2523 margin in the third game of the season on December 27, 1924 and against the Penn Quakers in the final game of the season on March 14, 1925 by a 2928 score.[1] Two-time All-American Arthur Loeb set numerous records, including the school record for career free throws made (342) that would stand until Harold Haabestad, Jr. totaled 376 during his career that ended with the 195455 season.[4]
