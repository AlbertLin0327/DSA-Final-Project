Tomah is a train station in Tomah, Wisconsin served by Amtrak, the national railroad passenger system. The station house is a wooden structure that was originally built by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad.[2] It is not a staffed station, but a caretaker opens and closes the waiting room, which occupies a corner of the original station structure. Tomah is served by Amtrak's daily Empire Builder. Of the eight Wisconsin stations served by Amtrak, Tomah was the seventh busiest in FY10, boarding or detraining an average of 30 passengers daily.[3]
