Institute is an unincorporated community on the Kanawha River in Kanawha County, West Virginia, USA. The community lies off of Interstate 64 and West Virginia Route 25, and has grown to intermingle with nearby Dunbar. Institute is home to West Virginia State University (formerly the West Virginia Colored Institute, the source of the town's toponym) Kanawha Valley Community and Technical College, and the West Virginia State Police Academy. It was also the site of an August 2008 chemical plant explosion that killed two and injured eight at the Bayer CropScience facility.[1] The community is the location of the prehistoric Shawnee Reservation Mound, one of three remaining Adena-era earthwork mounds and enclosures found in an eight-mile stretch along the river. Also called Fairgrounds Mound and Poorhouse Mound, it is now located within Shawnee Regional Park. The mound is about 20 high and 80 in basal diameter, but was originally 25 high and greater than 80 in diameter. In the late 19th century, the Smithsonian Institution inventoried more than 50 Adena-era earthwork mounds and ten enclosures along the Kanawha River. They were likely built by indigenous peoples approximately 300 BCE to 200 CE.[2] Located on the campus of West Virginia State University are East Hall and Canty House, both listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.[3]  This populated place also has portions in an adjacent county or counties
