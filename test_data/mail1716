Johan Cullberg, born in 1934, is a Swedish professor in psychiatry, researcher, psychoanalyst and author of a number of internationally recognized textbooks. He started his career at the department of gynecology at the Karolinska Hospital studying the effects of birth control. He came to head of one of the outpatient clinics in the Nacka project, doing groundbreaking work on psychiatric care outside the hospital in Sweden. He is recognized for advocacy of lower doses of antipsychotic medicine, reduction in compulsory treatment and more humane psychiatric care.[1] He was awarded the Dobloug Prize (Swedish: Doblougska priset), a literature prize awarded by the Swedish Academy in 2008. Cullberg is the Son of Bishop John Cullberg and brother of Erland Cullberg, painter, and to Staffan Cullberg, who has been head of the Swedish National Arts Council.
