Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc (in English The Little Singers of Saint Marc) is a children's choir, founded in September 1986 by Nicolas Porte. It is a mixed unit composed of seventy-five to eighty school-aged children from ten to fifteen years old. All are provided education from the Saint-Marc college in Lyon. Children join the choir in the sixth grade. After three years of training, they are integrated into . The Holy-Ursule School, on the same site as the college, enrolls children in preparation for admittance into the college. The choir belongs to the French Federation of Fdration franaise des petits chanteurs, itself a part of the Fdration internationale des Pueri Cantores. The choir's repertoire varies widely from spiritual hymns to classical and contemporary music. The children receive special training in musical theory, harmony, choir singing, chamber musical and more. No prior musical knowledge is required upon entry to the choir. The students practice between six and eight hours a week, with increased times according to concerts and performances. Les Petits Chanteurs acquired recognition with the release of the 2004 film Les Choristes, for which they provided the vocals for the soundtrack. One of the soloists, Jean-Baptiste Maunier was chosen to play a lead role in the film. The choir held a performance, entitled Les Choristes en concerte in which they sang a variety of songs, including several from the film. Jean-Baptiste Maunier and Emmanuel Liz were the boy soloists for the concert. After Maunier's departure from the choir, Liz moved to first soloist and his prior spot was filled by Rabi Ramadan. In addition to performances where they sing music from the film, the choir also performs Mozart's opera-comedy, Bastien and Bastienne. In 1995, the choir was named the official choir of the Basilica Notre-Dame de Fourvire. The choir performs in France as well as abroad, giving performances in Hong Kong, Canada, Russia, the United Kingdom, Lebanon, Japan,the United States and more.
