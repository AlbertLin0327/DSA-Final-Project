Union Pacific 1982 is an EMD SD70ACe locomotive owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. It is one of six SD70ACe locomotives referred to as the UP's Heritage units, units painted to pay tribute to predecessor railroads acquired by Union Pacific. UP 1982 is painted in Missouri Pacific colors. The locomotive was unveiled together with number 1983 (painted in honor of Western Pacific Railroad) in a private ceremony on July 30, 2005, in Omaha, Nebraska, after which it entered regular revenue service.
