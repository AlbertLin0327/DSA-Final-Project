Thomas "Fatty" Walsh (died September 7, 1929) was a New York mobster involved in narcotics and an associate of Dutch Schultz and Charles "Lucky" Luciano. He was taken in for questioning along with Luciano and George Uffner regarding the 1928 gangland slaying of Arnold Rothstein, of whom he was a former bodyguard with Jack "Legs" Diamond, however he and the others were later released. He was later killed at the Coral Gables Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables, Florida[1] during a gambling dispute on September 7, 1929. It has been claimed that his ghost haunts the hotel elevator, from which reports of doors opening and closing and lights blinking on and off,[2] as well as the 13th floor on which he was killed.[3]
