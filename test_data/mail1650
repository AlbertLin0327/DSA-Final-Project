Xinyi-Changxing Railway or Xinchang Railway (simplified Chinese: ; traditional Chinese: ; pinyin: Xny Chngxng til), also known as the Xinchang Line (simplified Chinese: ; traditional Chinese: ; pinyin: Xnchng xin), is a single-track railroad in eastern China between the cities of Xinyi, Jiangsu Province and Changxing County in Zhejiang Province. It runs north-south through the entire length of Jiangsu Province and northern tip of Zhejiang. Major cities along route include Huaian, Yancheng, Haian, Jingjiang, Jiangyin and Yixing. Including a 62.5km spur from Haian to Nantong, the Xinchang Railway is 638 km in total length. The Xinchang Railway was the first railway to be built in Jiangsu Province north of the Yangtze River. Construction began in September 1998 and the entire line was completed in April 2005. Passenger and freight service commenced on July 1, 2005. A connection to Nantong was added in 2008.[1] The Xinchang Railway connects the Longhai and Jiaozhou-Xinyi Railways in the north with the Nanjing-Nantong, Beijing-Shanghai, Xuancheng-Hangzhou Railways in the south. The Xinchang Line is the only major inland rail lines in China to use a river ferry. The railway does not have a bridge or tunnel crossing at the Yangtze River, so trains must be ferried across the river from Jingjiang to Jiangyin. A pair of ferries make 48 trips per day across the river.[2]
