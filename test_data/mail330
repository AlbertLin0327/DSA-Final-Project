Frederick John Cradock was posthumously awarded the George Cross for heroism in his attempts to save a workmate from boiling steam on 4 May 1943 in Glemsford in Suffolk. A boilerman by trade, he was born in 1886 in Acton, London and enlisted in the Royal Field Artillery in 1915, going on to serve in France and Belgium with the 156th Brigade during World War I. The award of the George Cross was announced in the London Gazette on 10 September 1943. The citation recounted how the boiler which he and a colleague, Albert Sterry, were working on exploded, filling the boiler house with scalding steam. Sterry was trapped in a well between the boiler and furnace and although Cradock, who was on top of the furnace at the time, could have jumped to safety he called for a ladder and attempted to climb down to rescue his workmate. He was overcome by the steam and severely scalded but made a second attempt to retrieve his friend. Despite his gallant efforts Sterry was killed and Cradock died making his second rescue bid. The story was recounted in the Haverhill Echo of 5 May 1943, noting how the explosion had been caused by a piece of metal lodging in a valve which prevented it venting excess pressure.[1]
