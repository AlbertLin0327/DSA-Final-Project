Herbert Feuerstein (born on 15 June 1937 in Zell am See, Austria) is a German comedian and entertainer. Feuerstein studied music at the Salzburg Mozarteum from 1956 to 1958, majoring in piano, cembalo and composition. However, he never graduated and in 1960, he followed his first wife to New York. There, he worked for and, from 1968, became editor of the German language newspaper New Yorker Staatszeitung. He also worked as a "U.S. correspondent" for the German satire magazine Pardon. After divorcing his first wife, Feuerstein returned to Europe in 1969. He worked as a publisher of the Pardon magazin and later, from 1968, was the editor of the German version of MAD magazine. Since 1984, he has mainly been working in German TV, being partner to Harald Schmidt in comedy shows such as "Pssst..." (19891995) and "Schmidteinander" (19901994). Twice, in 1997 and 1998, he hosted twelve-hour long live TV shows, dubbed "Feuersteins Nacht" (Feuerstein's Night), for WDR. He also worked as the dub voice of Gilbert Huph - with whom he bears a striking optical resemblance - in the German language version of Pixar's "The Incredibles". A native Austrian, he became a German citizen in 1992.
