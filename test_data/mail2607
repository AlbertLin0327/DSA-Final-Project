"Out of Tears" is a song by The Rolling Stones featured on their 1994 album Voodoo Lounge. A ballad, "Out of Tears" is credited to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, but is largely the work of Jagger[1]. The singer said at the time of release, Recording took place in 1993 and 1994 at Ronnie Wood's home in Ireland, Sandymount Studios, and A&M Recording Studios in Los Angeles.[1] With Jagger on lead vocals and acoustic guitar, Wood and Richards perform electric guitars, with Wood performing the solo; drums are by Charlie Watts; bass by Darryl Jones; piano by Chuck Leavell, organ by Benmont Tench, and percussion by Lenny Castro.[1] Released as the third single from Voodoo Lounge, "Out of Tears" reached number 60 in the US and number 36 in the UK.[citation needed] It was performed throughout the 1994-1995 Voodoo Lounge Tour,[citation needed] but as of 2007[update] had yet to be included on any live albums or compilations.
