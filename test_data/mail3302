Content:
Ira W. Sohn was a trader on Wall Street. After his death from cancer, his friends and colleagues founded the Ira W. Sohn Investment Research Conference in 1996, to raise funds for the Tomorrows Childrens Fund.[1] The event is popular on Wall Street,[1] where it has become an opportunity "to hear top money managers discuss their favorite stock picks."[2] David Einhorn delivered his analysis of Lehman Brothers at this conference in May 2008, in a talk titled "Accounting Ingenuity".[3]
