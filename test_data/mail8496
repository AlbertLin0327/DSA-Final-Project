Peter J. Ganci, Jr. (October 27, 1946 - September 11, 2001) was a career firefighter in the New York City Fire Department. At the time of the September 11 terrorist attacks he held the rank of Chief of Department, the highest ranking uniformed fire officer in the department.[1] Ganci was appointed to replace his boss Donald Burns as Chief of Operations, in January 1997.[2] He was appointed to the rank of Chief of Department in an acting capacity in March 1998 and assumed the office upon his formal appointment in October 1999. He was among the 343 New York City firefighters and paramedics who were killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.[1] He perished in the collapse of the South Tower of the World Trade Center. Prior to joining the Fire Department, Ganci served in the 82nd Airborne Division in the War in Vietnam.[3][4] In the Fire Department, he started in Engine Company 92 in the Bronx and then transferred to Ladder Company 111. He continued to work his way up the ladder over 31 years, before becoming the 28th Chief of Department.[5] He is survived by his sons, FDNY Firefighters Peter and Christopher, and his daughter Danielle.[1] Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan was unofficially renamed for him as Ganci Air Base. On Memorial Day, 2003 the post office at 380 Main Street in Farmingdale, New York was named for him. In 2003 Chris Ganci, one of his two sons, wrote a well-reviewed biography of Ganci.[4][6][7] At the National 9/11 Memorial, Ganci, Jr. is memorialized at the South Pool, on Panel S-17.[8]
