Mick Hoy is a former Irish footballer who played for Glenavon, Dundalk and Ireland. During the 1950s Hoy returned to his local club, Tandragee Rovers, where he worked as a coach with the senior and youth teams. When Hoy began his international career in 1937 there were, in effect, two Ireland teams, chosen by two rival associations. Both associations, the Northern Ireland - based IFA and the Irish Free State - based FAI claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and selected players from the whole island. Hoy was one of several players born in Northern Ireland who benefited from the FAIs attempts to establish their all-Ireland influence. Between 1937 and 1939 Hoy made 6 appearances for the FAI XI. He won all of these caps while playing for Dundalk. Together with fellow Northerner, Tommy Donnelly, he made his international debut in a 3-2 away defeat to Norway on October 10, 1937, in a qualifier for the 1938 FIFA World Cup. He made his final appearance for the FAI XI on May 23, 1939 in a 1-1 draw with Germany. In 1939, together with Jimmy Dunne and Kevin O'Flanagan, he also played twice for the League of Ireland XI, helping them to 2-1 victories against an Irish League XI and a Scottish League XI. Dundalk
