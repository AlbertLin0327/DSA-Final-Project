The Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) is a space exploration mission scheduled for launch in early 2013[2]. To carry out the mission NASA will send a robotic spacecraft into orbit around the Moon, and use instruments aboard the spacecraft to study the Moon's atmosphere and dust in the Moon's vicinity. Instruments will include a dust detector, a neutral mass spectrometer, an ultraviolet-visible spectrometer, and recently announced, a laser communications (lasercomm) terminal. LADEE was announced during the presentation of NASA's FY09 budget in February 2008. It will be launched aboard a Minotaur V from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport. LADEE is a strategic mission that will address three major science goals:[3] LADEE is scheduled for launch in May 2013 out of the Wallops Flight Facility on a Minotaur V carrier rocket.[4] The LADEE propulsion system will consist of an orbit control system (OCS) and a reaction control system (RCS). The OCS will provide velocity control along the +Z axis for large velocity adjustments. The RCS will provide three-axis attitude control during burns of the OCS system, and will also provide momentum dumps for the reaction wheels which are the primary attitude control system between OCS burns.[4] The LADEE spacecraft, as conceived in August 2009. The Modular Common Spacecraft Bus that will become LADEE, being tested at NASA Ames Research Center in 2008.
