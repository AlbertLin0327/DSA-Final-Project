Tere A. Zubizarreta, (1937  2007), known as the Hispanic advertising pioneer, Miami community activist, loving wife and mother Teresa A. Zubizarreta died peacefully on Thursday, July 26, 2007, after a hard-fought battle with cancer. Tere A Zubizarreta was born in Cuba, and in the early 60's emigrated to the United States, leaving behind a life and a lifestyle that could never be replicated. Undaunted by the realities of political exile, Tere reinvented her role as a wife and mother and embarked on a career that not only became a passion and successful business venture, but also became a catalyst for her future impact on the community. Zubizarretas achievements are of particular distinction, due to her humble beginnings as a Cuban-American woman with no college degree in a largely male driven, 70s corporate America. But over three decades ago, in a rented office in Miami with one phone and a borrowed typewriter, Zubizarreta opened the doors to Zubi Advertising Services. Against all odds, she led the agency to soaring levels of success; today boasting over 122 employees, billings in excess of $195 million, countless awards for superior creative work and a remarkable list of Blue Chip clients including American Airlines, Ford Motor Company, Lincoln Mercury, Winn-Dixie, JP Morgan Chase and SC Johnson to name a few. Along the way, her vision helped forge a deeper interest and understanding of the Hispanic market, a movement that eventually revolutionized the way corporate America advertised to the rapidly growing consumer base. Tere Zubizarreta is survived by her husband Octavio, son Joe, daughter Michelle, grandchildren Charlotte and Michael, sister Annie Slatkoff, nephew Joshua Slatkoff and niece Jessica Slatkoff. Zubizarreta was always actively involved in the Miami community, constantly seeking to improve the status of others around her. She was the first Hispanic woman to be elected to the Board of Governors and Committee Chair of the United Way of America, and also served on the board of directors for the Orange Bowl Committee, Beacon Council and Miami Childrens Hospital. She was a co-founder and former chairperson of FACE, Facts About Cuban Exiles. Teres successful achievement was also recognized by the Governor of the State of Florida Jeb Bush who expressed his deep sense of appreciation for the guidance and leadership she has provided to all communities throughout her life. Throughout her distinguished career, Zubizarreta received an array of awards for her contributions to the U.S. Hispanic advertising industry, most recently the Eduardo Caballero Lifetime Achievement Award - the industrys highest - from the Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies. Other organizations that honored her include the Latin Business Association, the National Association of Hispanic Publications, the Womens Automotive Association International and Latin Business Magazine.
