"Breathless" is the fifth and final single from Corinne Bailey Rae's debut album, Corinne Bailey Rae. Released in 2007 only in the United States. "Breathless" started receiving digital download on iTunes in 6 February 2007, prior to its official single release in 30 November 2007. The song charted only on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart at number seventy and missed the Billboard Hot 100, for lack of disclosure of the label Capitol Records-based record label by EMI. The song spent 12 weeks on the chart, two more than the single "Like a Star".
