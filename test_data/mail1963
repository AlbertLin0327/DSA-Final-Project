Charles A. Mason was a Michigan politician.[1][2] Charles A. Mason purchased Austin B. Witherbee's self-named drug store downtown and ran it for 22 years. It is now the name of a new grocery store set to open in spring 2009 to serve the downtown area at the corner of King Avenue and University Drive, the former old Hats by Jake building.[3] He was elected as the mayor of the City of Flint in 1881 serving a 1-year term.[1][4]
