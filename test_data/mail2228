In the mid-1980s, the university was authorized by Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China to give postgraduate courses. DLUFL employs about 80 native-language teachers from the United States, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Austria, Canada, Australia, and the Republic of Korea.
