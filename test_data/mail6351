University rowing in the United Kingdom began when it was introduced to Oxford in the late 18th century[citation needed]. The first University Boat Race (between Oxford and Cambridge) was held in 1829. Today, many universities have a boat club and at the collegiate universities, Oxford, Cambridge, Durham, and London, each college has its own club as well as a main university club. Most universities compete in the British Universities & Colleges Sport (BUCS) Championships with a number of events over the year. For non-indoor events, boats are separated into Championship (where "[BUCS] points" are available), Intermediate and Beginner (for students in their first year of the sport). As of June 16, 2008, UCS (who represented the professional staff working in the sector) and BUSA (the lead body for competitive sport in the sector) have merged to form "BUCS" - British Universities & Colleges Sport. Events from 2008/09 onwards therefore come under the BUCS banner, rather than BUSA, e.g., BUCS Regatta. The Small Boats Head is held in October. The event was introduced in 2004 and held on the Trent in Nottingham. The event was run in Nottingham every year until 2008 when it was moved to Boston where it now runs in conjunction with the GB Rowing Team 1st Senior/U23 Assessment. In 2010, BUCS Rowing managed an indoor rowing series at 11 Universities across the UK. Almost 900 students competed a 2000m test and a similar series is planned for 2011. A 5km head race which was held for many years on the River Trent in Nottingham during February or March. In 2009, the decision was made to move the event to the River Nene in Peterborough, and to split the competition into 2 separate days, with Beginners racing on one day, and Seniors racing on the other. However, due to inclement weather, the event was cancelled. The event was again held in Peterborough in 2010, and 2011. A 2km regatta held (usually at Holme Pierrepont) over the May Day weekend. Points for the Victor Ludorum are awarded for finishing places in the finals (more points for champ events and bigger boats). In 2005 Durham University Boat Club were 1st, followed by Reading University in 2nd place and UL behind them in 3rd place. DUBC followed up their wins in 2004 and 2005 by taking the title for a third time in 2006, and followed it up with unprecedented fourth and fifth victories in 2007 and 2008 before winning again in 2011. In 2008 the BUSA regatta was held at Strathclyde Country Park, as NWSC was not available that weekend. Two weeks earlier, a BUSA Sprint Regatta was held at Cotswold Water Park, though the regatta had to be held as a time trial because the weather had prevented the course and stakeboats being laid . A number of university boat clubs have organised annual races between themselves. These include: There are separate bumps races held every year for the Cambridge colleges, Oxford colleges, and London medical schools (called the "United Hospitals Bumps"). Durham College Rowing organises two inter-collegiate regattas and two head races between the Durham Colleges.
