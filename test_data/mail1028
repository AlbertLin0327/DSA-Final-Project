The Australian Charbray is a beef breed of cattle that is the result of the blending of two breeds, the Charolais and the Brahman. The Australian Charbray is within the range of 75% and 25% Charolais and Brahman, either way. The hump of the Brahman is almost non-existent, but the loose skin and enlarged dewlap are indications of the Bos indicus blood in this breed. The Charbray is a large breed that is heavily muscled in the loin and quarters. They have been well accepted in those areas where cattle carrying at least some Brahman breeding are desired because of hot and humid conditions.[1] An Australian Charbray is cream to light red coloured with very good growth rates on their calves. The calves are generally light tan when born but may lighten to a creamy white in a few weeks. The Charbray bull is structurally sound and has the ability to travel the distances required of bulls in hot humid environments. They have been selected for clean, tight sheaths, fertility and early testicular development. The Charbray female is also early maturing, reaching puberty at 1417 months and calving at or near two years of age with rapid rebreeding and good milk production.[1] The Australian Charbrays have performed very well in weight gain trials including Aus-Meat National Livestock Feedback Trials and in hoof and hook competitions. Sources indicate that the Charbray calves show excellent performance in the feedlot. Their resistance to heat, humidity, parasites and diseases is to their benefit in southern feedlots. They grow rapidly and have outstanding feed converting ability. They reach slaughter weights at 12 to 15 months and produce lean, yield grade 1 and 2 carcases that require little or no fat trimming.
