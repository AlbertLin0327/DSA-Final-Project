Mount Matthews is the highest peak in the Rimutaka Ranges to the east of Wellington Harbour and the Wellington Region in general. Mt Matthews reaches a height of 940 metres and although not special on that account, it has significance in regard to its distinctive aspect as seen from Wellington the capital city of New Zealand; it is the highest peak that can be seen on the sky line east of the city. The mountain reaches just above the bushline and can be climbed as a day hike without mountaineering equipment but is nevertheless a strenuous and steep climb and a full day should be allowed by the time access to the feet of the ranges is included. Access is gained either from the Wairarapa (eastern) side of the Rimutakas or from the Orongorongo River that lies between Wellington and the ranges.
