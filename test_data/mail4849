Convoy OA 178 was an Atlantic convoy that sailed in July 1940 from the Thames Estuary via the English Channel, prior to dispersal to various trans-Atlantic destinations.[3] OA 178 assembled off Southend-on-Sea on the coast of Essex and departed on 3 July.[1] It consisted of 35 merchant ships, escorted by the Flower class corvette HMSClarkia.[1] Convoy Commodore was Capt. RP Galer, in SS Peterton.[3] OA 178 passed though the Straits of Dover during the night of 3/4 July and by the afternoon of 4 July was in the Channel, some 20 miles south of Portland Bill. At about 1300 hrs[4] on 4 July two Gruppen of Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers from StG 2 attacked the convoy in the English Channel off Portland Bill.[2] The Stukas were armed with 50 kilograms (110lb) bombs and attacked in waves of six aircraft. There was no Allied air cover and the attack lasted about two hours.[4] In this attack one ship, MVDallas City was sunk and five ships, SS Antonio, SS Argos Hill, SS Briarwood, SS Eastmoor and Danish turbine steamer TS Lifland were damaged.[2] The Antonio rescued 67 survivors, including two with serious injuries, from ships that were sunk.[4] Some ships of the convoy took shelter in Portland Harbour, where the Luftwaffe attacked them again. Also in Portland Harbour were a number of other ships, which were hit in the attack. The Royal Navy anti-aircraft ship HMSFoylebank was severely damaged, and sank the next day with the loss of 176 lives.[5] The tug Silverdial was also sunk[5] and the cargo ships SS City of Melbourne, SS East Wales and MV William Wilberforce were damaged.[2] Bombs had damaged the Antonio's rudder and the stanchions supporting her propellor shaft.[4] She had to reduce speed and did not reach anchorage in Portland Harbour until about 2300 hrs.[4] The continuing air raid prevented her from landing the survivors she had rescued until mid-day on 5 July.[4] At dusk those members of the convoy that had remained at sea were 13 miles (21km) south of Portland when they were attacked by German E-boats. Four ships were sunk, and one damaged. The cargo ship SSElmcrest was sunk by a torpedo and 16 of her crew were lost.[2] SS Hartlepool was damaged.[2] Also lost were the Dutch ships SSBritsum and SSDeucalion, and the Estonian ship SSKolga.[5] The Deucalion's wreck lies south of Selsey Bill,[6] which suggests that either she was a straggler or she was dive-bombed before the main air raid off Portland Bill. On 5 July OA 178's lone escort was reinforced by the destroyer HMSBroke(D83).[1] She remained with the convoy until 6 July[1] when it dispersed in the Southwest Approaches. The severity of loss and damage that OA 178 sustained was such that all subsequent OA convoys were re-routed, from Methil in Fife around the north of Scotland to avoid the English Channel.[2] Allied ships sunk Coordinates: 5031N 226W / 50.517N 2.433W / 50.517; -2.433
