Seumas is a masculine given name in Irish, and Scottish Gaelic.[1] The names are the equivalent of the English James. The Scottish Gaelic Seumas is pronounced "shay-mas".[2] The vocative case of the Scottish Gaelic Seumas is Sheumais, which has given form to the Anglicised form of this name, Hamish.[3] In Irish, Seumas is the older form of the modern Samas. This modern name is pronounced "shay-mus" in Irish. Another earlier form of Samas is Samus, which is partially Anglicised as Seamus.[4]
