"Into the Groove(y)" was a single of Madonna covers from Mike Watt and Sonic Youth's side-project Ciccone Youth. It was released in 1986 on Blast First Records.[1] Mike Watt's version of "Burnin' Up" recorded May 5, 1986 (with Greg Ginn's guitar overdubbed on August 7, 1986). It is not the same version that appears on The Whitey Album. "Tuff Titty Rap" & "Into The Groovey", recorded during the EVOL sessions in March 1986 at Martin Bisi's studio in Brooklyn, are the same versions that appear on The Whitey Album.
