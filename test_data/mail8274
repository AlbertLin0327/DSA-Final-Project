Taoism (Vietnamese: o gio Vit Nam) is believed to have been introduced into Vietnam during the Chinese Han Dynasty period (206 BC220 AD). It became one of the main religious faiths of the Vietnamese people. Under L Dynasty King L Nhn Tng (1072-1127), the examination for the recruitment of officials consisted of essays on the "Three Religions" (Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism). Under the succeeding dynasties, Taoism has become a source of inspiration for Vietnamese poets and writers. Taoism also influenced the establishment of the Cao Dai religion in Vietnam.
