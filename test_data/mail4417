The Peel Session is a collection of recordings by Syd Barrett released on 25 January 1987. This EP contains the five songs he performed for the John Peel show, recorded on 24 February 1970 and transmitted March 14 the same year. All songs written by Syd Barrett (with the possible exception of "Two of a Kind" -- see below). Note that "Two of a Kind" was credited to Rick Wright on the original Peel Session release, but to Barrett on later releases, including The Best of Syd Barrett: Wouldn't You Miss Me?. According to David Gilmour, Wright wrote the song but an increasingly confused Barrett insisted it was his own composition (and wanted to include it on The Madcap Laughs).[2] When asked about the matter in a 1996 interview, Wright's reply was enigmatic: "Can't answer, I am looking into this."[3]
