The Institute Id of Christ the Redeemer, Idente Missionaries], is a Catholic congregation founded by Fernando Rielo in 1959 on the island of Tenerife, Spain. The congregation has men and women religious, as well as married missionaries. The Idente Missionaries come under the category of new forms of consecrated life in the Catholic code of canon law. Both, the men's and the women's congregations of the Idente Missionaries have a General Superior. The Apostolic President is the Vicar of the Founder and the bond of unity between the two congregations. The men's congregation has a Patriarch, responsible for the administration of each continent. The women's congregation has a Matriarch for administration of a continent. Provincial Superiors are responsible for administration in each Province. A province may have one or more delegations within it. A Superior administers each residence of the Idente Missionaries. The Idente School is a school for the study, dialogue and dissemination of the Genetic metaphysics of Fernando Rielo. Its headquarters is in Rome, Italy. The Idente Youth is a foundation to promote idealism on Catholic and non Catholic youth. The Fernando Rielo Foundation publishes books and works of the Founder. It also encourages culture and poetry. Each year, since 1981, the Foundation awards the Fernando Rielo World Prize for Mystical Poetry.
