Ilava (German: Illau, Hungarian: Illava) is a town in the Trenn Region, northwestern Slovakia. It is located in the Ilava Basin near the Vh river at the foothills of Strovsk vrchy mountains, near the cities of Povask Bystrica and Trenn. In addition to the main settlement, it also has "boroughs" of Iliavka and Klobuice (both since 1969, latter with a Classic castle). The first written reference to the town dates from 1332/1337, the town charter stems from 1339.[citation needed] The settlement developed below a Gothic castle (bearing the same name) from the 13th century, turned into a Renaissance fortification in the 16th century, into a monastery in 1693 and finally, in 1856, into a prison. A concentration camp was in the prison in 1938.[citation needed] According to the 2001 census, the town had 5,441 inhabitants. 98.1% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 0.9% Czechs and 0.1% Roma and Hungarians.[1] The religious makeup was 87.2% Roman Catholics, 7.9% people with no religious affiliation, and 1.2% Lutherans.[1] It is the birthplace of two-time Stanley Cup Champion and current Florida Panthers left winger Tom Kopeck.
