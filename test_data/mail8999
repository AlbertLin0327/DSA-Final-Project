Andrew L. "Buckshot" Roberts (died April 4, 1878) was an American buffalo hunter and cowboy whose last stand against the Lincoln County Regulators during the Gunfight of Blazer's Mills near Lincoln, New Mexico is a part of frontier legend. Although the huge majority of famous gunfights that took place in the Old West have been exaggerated beyond the realms of credibility, the fight at Blazer's Mills is one of the few where reliable sources have described a feat of profound ability and toughness. Despite his toughness, Roberts died at Blazer's Mills, following a shoot-out with the Regulators, who believed that Roberts had been involved in the murder of their boss, John Tunstall. They famously included Billy the Kid, who played a part in that fight. It was, however, Regulators Charlie Bowdre and George Coe who fired the fatal shots which killed Roberts, although Roberts would shoot dead one Regulator, Dick Brewer, at the same location, and wound several others. Little has been verified of Roberts' life. He is believed to have been an associate of Buffalo Bill Cody, and may have been involved in a shootout with the Texas Rangers at this time. He earned his nickname due to a serious injury. Having been shot, there was still a load of buckshot embedded in his right shoulder, indicating that it is likely he was involved in at least one violent encounter. The wound impaired the movement in his right arm, which he could not raise above his pelvis. He fought during the Civil War in the Confederate Army and has a Confederate marker now placed near his grave, and by 1876 had his own small ranch in Ruidoso Valley, near to Lincoln.[citation needed] He was known as a quiet, secretive man, who rarely, if ever spoke of his past, though he was reportedly not a man to upset. A stubborn loner, he preferred to ride a mule rather than a horse. He was short and stocky in appearance. He worked for James Dolan, thus, when the Lincoln County War broke out he became a target of those loyal to John Tunstall and Alexander McSween. At the time of the gunfight at Blazer's Mills, the Lincoln County Regulators did have a warrant for Roberts's arrest.[citation needed] In reality, Buckshot Roberts wanted no part in the Lincoln County War and had made plans to leave the area, selling his ranch and waiting for the check from his buyer. On April 4, 1878, Roberts rode his mule into Blazer's Mills, a sawmill and trading post located on the Rio Tularosa. Looking to collect his check, he was shocked to discover that the entire upper echelon of the Regulators were eating lunch in a nearby building. They had left the area around Lincoln, New Mexico after killing Sheriff William Brady just three days earlier. One of them, Frank Coe, sat with Roberts on the steps of the main house and tried to talk him into surrendering. The old gunman refused, believing he would be killed by the vengeful cowboys. Regulator chief Dick Brewer grew impatient with the stand-off and sent a few of his men outside to take Roberts into custody. At the sight of the armed, quickly walking cowboys, Roberts jumped up, aiming his Winchester. Both he and Charlie Bowdre fired at the same time. Roberts was struck in the stomach while his shot hit Bowdres belt buckle, severing his gun belt and knocking the wind from him. Dangerously wounded, Roberts kept pumping bullets at the Regulators as he retreated to the doorway. John Middleton was seriously wounded in the chest. One slug grazed Doc Scurlock and another struck George Coe in the right hand, costing him his thumb and trigger finger. Coe shifted his rifle and returned fire, hitting Roberts. Once the magazine of Roberts' rifle clicked empty, Billy the Kid dashed from cover to finish off the wounded gunman, only to be knocked senseless by the barrel of the Winchester. Barricading himself in the house, Roberts ignored both his painful wound and the Regulators' gunshots, arming himself with a single-shot Springfield rifle and readied himself. Stunned by the turn of events, the Regulators tended to their wounded and tried to get Roberts to come out. Frustrated that none of his men dared to approach the fortified adversary, Dick Brewer circled around the main house and took cover behind some stacked logs and opened fire on the room where the wounded man was. Roberts, seeing the cloud of gun smoke from the log pile, sighted in and opened fire when Brewer put his head up again, striking the cowboy in the eye. The Regulators, demoralized by their casualties, pulled out and left the area after sending in a doctor to check on Roberts. Buckshot Roberts died the next day and he and Dick Brewer were buried side by side near the big house where the gunfight occurred.[citation needed] Buckshot Roberts appears in the 1988 film Young Guns, portrayed by actor Brian Keith. Some aspects of the real Roberts' life are recreated in the film, such as his status as a grizzled, veteran gunfighter, and his desire to avoid the ongoing Lincoln County War. He is also shown riding a mule. His lone scene in the film is a fictionalized shoot-out, similar in some respects to the actual Blazer's Mills encounter, where Roberts tracks The Regulators in hopes of collecting a bounty placed on their heads. After a brief conversation where he matter-of-factly states his intentions, Roberts opens fire on the gang (with a Winchester rifle and in a crouched position, both indicative of the real Buckshot Roberts) wounding a number of them before retreating to an outhouse for safety. After firing continuously at the outhouse, Dick Brewer dares Billy the Kid to see if Roberts is still alive. Billy is greeted with a hail of fire nearly killing him. Roberts then kills Dick Brewer with a shot through the chest and not with a shot through the eye like in real life. The rest of the Regulators open fire at the outhouse and then quickly flee. Roberts' fate in the movie is left unclear although he likely died from his wounds as had the real Buckshot Roberts.
