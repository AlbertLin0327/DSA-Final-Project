"It's All in Your Head" is the title of a song recorded by American country music group Diamond Rio. It was released in August 1996 as the third single from their 1996 album, IV. It peaked at #15 in the United States, and #17 in Canada. The song was co-written by Van Stephenson, who was then a member of the country music band Blackhawk. The song describes a boy who has grown up suffering from the death of his parents. The boy's father was a preacher man looking forward to the end of the world, and he died while having the spirit to take up a snake, and he was killed by it. The boy's father's last words to the boy were We never walked on the moon, Elvis ain't dead, you ain't going crazy, it's all in your head. Deborah Evans Price, of Billboard magazine reviewed the song favorably, calling the song "unique, with an infectious, swampy beat and intriguing lyric about a "sidewalk soapbox preacher" on an unusual path to salvation." She goes on to say that lead vocalist Marty Roe "tackles the lyric with a funky energy."[1] The music video was directed by directing duo Deaton-Flanigen Productions. It describes most of the content, and shows the boy grown up being in a mental hospital. Martin Sheen plays the father and his son Ramon Estevez as the son as an adult. "It's All in Your Head" debuted at number 70 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks for the week of August 24, 1996.
