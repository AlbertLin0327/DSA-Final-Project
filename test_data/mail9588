The Crusader Union of Australia, known as Crusaders, is a Bible-based, interdenominational Christian youth organisation based in Australia that teaches the Gospel of Jesus Christ to independent school students in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.[1] The Crusader Union was founded in 1930 by the Rev. Dr Howard Guinness in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. In that year the first Crusader Camp was held. In 1934 Crusaders was founded in Western Australia. A prayer group, The Crusader Womens Fellowship, began meeting in Roseville Park in 1939. The land for the Crusader campsite at at Lake Macquarie, New South Wales was donated by Dr Leslie Parr in the 1940s and in the 1950s Dr Paul White mortgaged his home to buy land at Galston Gorge for 600. In 1955 Crusaders merged with the Scripture Union in all states exceptNSW. During the 1960s Crusaders became a Registered Company Limited by Guarantee to meet legal requirements. The first office had been in the city but moved to Strathfield in 1988 and then to Eastwood in 1993. The Crusader Union ofNSWbecame the Crusader Union of Australia on 23rd May 1990 and the current Crusader eagle logo was introduced in 1997. Crusaders celebrated its 80th anniversary in September 2010.[2] Crusaders has three key ministry areas: These ministries are supported by two campsites; Galston Gorge Conference & Recreation Centre and Lake Macquarie Outdoor Recreation Centre with water-based activities and a own sailing fleet.
