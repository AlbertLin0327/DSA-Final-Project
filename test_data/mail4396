The King of Rally ( ?, "King of the Paris - Moscow - Beijing Rally")[4] is a rally-type Super Famicom racing video game, set in a rally raid similar to that of the Paris-Dakar Rally. This scenario depicts an international race where the player has to drive an off-roader across a rally course in order to obtain the best time. In the year 1907, a brave group of drivers decide to travel from Paris to Moscow and eventually to Beijing (then known as Peking) by using automobile routes. This expedition was publicized in the French newspaper Le Matin and became a race where the object was to travel across the Old World as fast as he can go. After 85 years of competition, people are still interested in running this rally race. As of 1992, Japan maintains an office where serious competitors register to compete in the Paris-Moskow-Beijing rally every year. While the off-roaders are tough, they cannot absorb unlimited damage. Players must waste time fixing their off-roaders in case of a trouble situation with either the engine or other vital automobile parts. The player has the choice of either practicing any of the ten levels in the game or starting a full race once he or she has practice all the moves. In addition, the player has to watch out for his or her fuel consumption. If he or she runs out of fuel, then he or she has to retire from the race or practice session. Like all Japanese games, the speed gauge of the player's vehicle is in kilometers. Through desert, snow, paved, and unpaved roads, the player must race from Paris to Moscow and finally to Beijing as fast as he or she can in order to become the best rally racer in the world. While the drive through France and Germany start out as paved roads and easy forest drives, the player encounters ice and snow once he or she enters Russia. After that the player goes south through the former Soviet republics and then east through parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Finally the player goes through Nepal and its snowy district and makes his or her way through the final level. The final level consists of navigating his or her way through the Great Wall of China. After that, the player arrives safely in Beijing, and the game is finally over. This picture shows a 1907 copy of the defunct French newspaper, Le Matin. The newspaper in question depicts the story about how the Paris-Moscow-Beijing rally first started out. This is a map of the entire rally. The rally goes through two continents: Europe and Asia.
