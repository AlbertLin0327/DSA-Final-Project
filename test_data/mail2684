The UWA World Featherweight Championship (Campeonato Mundial peso Pluma de UWA in Spanish) was a professional wrestling championship promoted by the Mexican wrestling promotion Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) from 1983 until the promotion closed in 1995. Being a professional wrestling championship it is not won legitimately; it is instead won via a scripted ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline. The official definition of the Featherweight weight class in Mexico is between 57kg (130lb) and 63kg (140lb), but is not always strictly enforced.[Note 1][1] the UWA WOrld Featherweight Championship was not among the UWA titles that were kept active even after the UWA closed, like the UWA World Heavyweight Championship, but was abandoned when the UWA closed down. As of September 3, 2010
