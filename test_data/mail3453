This article is part of the series: Politics and government of Bulgaria Parliamentary elections were held in Bulgaria on 17 June 2001.[1] The result was a victory for the National Movement  Simeon II, which won 120 of the 240 seats. Voter turnout was 67.0%.[2] Following the election, Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the country's last Tsar, became Prime Minister after forming a coalition with the Movement for Rights and Freedoms,[3] the party representing the Turkish minority.[4] The elections came four years after the last parliamentary elections in 1997, marking the first occasion since the fall of Communism that a full term had been completed.[3] A total of 65 parties registered for the elections, together with eleven independents.[3] National Movement  Simeon II was originally prevented from registering by Sofia City Court as it failed to meet the Central Election Committee's requirements. However, after forming an alliance with the Bulgarian Women's Party and the Movement for National Revival, the party was allowed to register.[3]
