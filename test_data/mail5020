Dayne Beams (born 12 February 1990) is a professional Australian rules football player currently playing for Collingwood in the Australian Football League. Beams was selected by Collingwood with selection 29 in the 2008 AFL Draft. A versatile midfilelder who can defend and attack, Beams is a high possession winner who is balanced and composed when in close proximity to opponents. A Queensland representative in the 2008 NAB AFL Under-18 championships, Beams knocked back a deal to sign with future Gold Coast Football Club instead deciding to nominate for the 2008 AFL Draft. He was again linked to the new Queensland based club in 2009, but signed an extension to his contract to the end of the 2012 season.[1] Beams played three games in the NAB Cup kicking a goal in each game, including a super goal against Essendon. He made his AFL debut in round 2, when Dale Thomas was a late withdrawal from the team due to a virus.[2] Beams finished 4th in the NAB Rising Star 2009 after being nominated in Round 17.[3] He won the Harry Collier Trophy in 2009 as Collingwood's best first year player.[4]
