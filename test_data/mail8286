Caenogastropoda is a taxonomic clade, a large diverse group which is mostly sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks, but also includes some freshwater snails and some land snails. Caenogastropoda contains many families of shelled marine molluscs including the periwinkles, cowries, wentletraps, moon snails, murexes, cone snails and turrids. About 60% of all living gastropods belong to the Caenogastropoda.[3] The Caenogastropoda exhibit torsion and thus are included in what was previously been called the Streptoneura (meaning twisted nerves), also known as Prosobranchia (meaning gills forward). Specifically, they are characterized by having only a single auricle in the heart and a single pair a gill leaflets, and are equivalent to the Monotocardia or Pectinobranchia of older authors. The taxon Caenogastropoda was first established by Leslie Reginald Cox in 1960 as a superorder[4] but now sometimes it is retained as a clade. This group combines the older taxa Mesogastropoda and Stenoglossa from classification by Johannes Thiele[5] and is equivalent to the Monotocardia as defined by Mrch in 1865, as revised. Caenogastropoda can be divided into two major groups based on the anatomy of the radula: Ponder & Lindberg, 1997 and others since (e.g. Vega et al., 2006[6]; Harzhauser, 2004[7]; and Pina, 2002.[8]) show Caenogastropoda as a superorder, following the sense of Cox, 1960. More recently Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005 revised Caenogastropoda as a clade. The following classification was laid out in the taxonomy of Bouchet & Rocroi (2005):[5] Colgan et al. (2006)[9] provided further insight into the phylogeny of Caenogastropoda.
