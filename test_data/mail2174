Allen R. Steen is an American martial arts practitioner, teacher, and promoter. He was taught by Jhoon Rhee, the "Father of American Taekwondo", and was the first of Rhee's American students to reach black belt standing. He was inducted into the Taekwondo Hall of Fame in 2007. Steen was a business student at the University of Texas when he began studying under Jhoon Rhee in 1959. He achieved his black belt in 1962. Following Rhee's departure from Texas, Steen set up his own school in Dallas, which grew into a network of schools throughout the state. In 1964, Steen founded the Southwest Karate Black Belt Association, which in 1972 became the American Karate Black Belt Association. In 1966, Steen won the Long Beach International Karate Championships, in the process defeating both Chuck Norris and Joe Lewis.
