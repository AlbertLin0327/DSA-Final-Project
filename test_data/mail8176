Coordinates: 5257N 054W / 52.95N 0.90W / 52.95; -0.90 Aslockton is a village and civil parish twelve miles (19km) east of Nottingham, England and two miles east of Bingham on the north bank of the River Smite opposite Whatton. It has a population of around 1,000 [1]. The village is the site of Aslockton railway station and, despite its small size contains two pubs, the Old Greyhound and the Cranmer Arms. The Old Greyhound closed in May 2007, and its new owners have submitted a planning application [2] to turn the building into a restaurant. The name of the village comes from the Danish and Saxon name Haslachstone and became Aslacton before becoming the modern Aslockton. Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury 15331553, was born in Aslockton and spent his childhood in a cottage that still exists. The village school is named in his honour. The Aslockton windmill and bakehouse were situated on Mill Lane (grid reference SK739408)[1]. The mill was a wooden postmill, weatherboarded, on a brick roundhouse, with 4 single patent sails. The miller and baker in 1864 was Job Heathcote[2]. 1. Thomas Cranmer (b.1489-d.1556) Archbishop of Canterbury and leader of the English Reformation; born in Aslockton.
