The album charted at number 46 on the Top Independent albums chart[1] "Ghost" released as a single was made a music video and filmed in Miami, Florida. A video was also made for "Thick is the Skin" and a promo video was made for "New Generation" both of which featuring on the DVD "Skid Row - Under the Skin (The Making of Thickskin)". "I Remember You Two" is a remake of the band's classic hit single "I Remember You" in a more punk rock influenced fashion. Allmusic gave Thinkskin a rating of three stars out of five, and said that the album displayed a sound that trended more towards alternative rock than earlier releases, but was nevertheless "surprisingly good."[2]
