The Great Migration Study Project is an ongoing scholarly endeavor to catalogue all emigrants to colonial New England between 1620 and 1643 (the Puritan great migration). Directed by Robert Charles Anderson, it is done in collaboration with the New England Historic Genealogical Society. The project's first series of volumes, covering immigrants from 1620 to 1633, is entitled The Great Migration Begins. Publication of the second series, covering 1634 and 1635, is ongoing. It is entitled The Great Migration. Anderson edits the series, with two co-editors working on the first two volumes in the latest series, George Freeman Sanborn and Melinde Lutz Sanborn.
