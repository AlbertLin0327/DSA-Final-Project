Louisiana Highway 3246 marker Highways in Louisiana Louisiana Highway 3246 (LA 3246) is a state highway in Louisiana that serves East Baton Rouge Parish. It spans 3.85 miles (6.20km) in a south to north direction. It is known locally as Siegen Lane. From the south, LA 3246 begins at a junction with LA 42 in Baton Rouge where LA 42 turns east from Burbank Drive onto Highland Road. Burbank Drive becomes Siegen Lane north of this intersection. LA 3246 then crosses LA 427 (Perkins Road). Shortly thereafter, LA 3246 intersects I-10 at a diamond interchange (Exit 163). It continues northward to a terminus US 61 and LA 73 (Airline Highway). At the opposite side of the intersection, Siegen Lane becomes South Sherwood Forest Boulevard. LA 3246 is an undivided, two lane highway from LA 42 where LA 42 turns east from Burbank Drive onto Highland Road to just south of LA 427 (Perkins Road). At that point, it widens to an undivided, five lane highway (with a middle turning lane). The middle turning lane ends just before an overpass over North Ward Creek, a railline, and an interchange at South Mall Drive. It then briefly becomes a divided, six lane highway until just past the interchange at I-10. For the final stretch, it is an undivided, seven lane highway (with a middle turning lane).
