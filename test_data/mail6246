Futurecop! are British electronic musicians consisting of Manzur Iqbal and Peter Carrol. Growing up in Manchester, England, Manzur played in various punk rock bands, however he had a real passion for re-creating the electronic synth melodies influenced by fantasy, nostalgia and maladaptive daydreaming. With his musical experience consolidating a wide, eclectic range of tastes, Manzur entered University, took the same course as Peter, and a friendship was formed.[1] After University, Peter was djing nightclubs, while Manzur wanted to escape life by spending all of his time re-creating the sound of his childhood and his maladaptive daydreaming of fantasy, with no previous knowledge of electronic production. He was armed with a laptop, a broken midi keyboard and a pirated music program called Reason. Manzur and Peter both combined each other's musical journeys; thus Futurecop! was born.[2] Thanks to internet attention from popular blogs and support from various well-known musicians, Futurecop! gained a significant following, especially with their lo-fi tracks N.A.S.A "Tonite's Hero" and Transformers, which Manzur openly admits was made only on his laptop, while half asleep in bed watching his childhood movies. In 2009, they signed with LA based label Iheartcomix in the USA & Canada along with Southern Fried Records for their debut EP The Unicorn & the Lost City of Alvograth. They have performed electronic live shows in Australia, USA, Sweden, France, Germany, Spain, U.K, Miami WMC, SXSW Festival, The Big Chill Festival.[3] Futurecop produced the underground hit for Green Label Sound with Hum Drum Town, featuring vocals by Theophilus London. Futurecop! has been compared to groups like Justice and Daft Punk. In 2010 they were approached by Japanese record label and publisher Media Factory (famous for producing anime movies such as Pokemon), to produce a 'Japan only' album, which they named; 'it's Forever, Kids' In 2011, Futurecop! released their second EP (The Adventures of Starpony) on The Sleepover Party, with tracks reaching top 5 in the Hype Machine Popular Charts. In late 2011, their remix of The Naked & Famous's 'Young Blood,' was played by international House DJ Tiesto in his world tour, gathering attention in the club world. Since then they created various remixes for the likes of Foster the People, Cobra Starship and Angels and Airwaves. January 23, 2012 saw the release of their first full length release - 'The Movie OST,' via Kiez Beats Records, this was an electronic instrumental soundtrack, created for a made up fantasy movie. The album went to number 7 on the Beatport indie / dance charts in January 2012. April 24th 2012 Futurecop will release of their first single and official music video - Starworshipper http://www.beatportal.com/feed/item/introducing-futurecop/
