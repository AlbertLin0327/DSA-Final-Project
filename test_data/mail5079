The 2004 WTA Tour was the 32nd season since the founding of the Women's Tennis Association. It commenced on January 5, 2004, and concluded on November 13, 2004, after 60 events. In an open year, Lindsay Davenport finished the season at No. 1 for the third time after 1998 and 2001, despite not reaching even a Grand Slam final. Amlie Mauresmo put together a consistent season, reaching No. 1 in September and finishing the year ranked No. 2. The Russian contingent enjoyed an impressive rise into the elite of women's tennis, with Anastasia Myskina, Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova all winning their first Grand Slam titles, and Elena Dementieva being twice a runner-up. However, the Belgian pair of Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin-Hardenne, who had risen to the top of women's tennis during 2003, both struggled with injuries throughout the season. Likewise, the dominance of the Williams sisters diminished, with both finishing the season out of the top 5. World No. 1 Justine Henin-Hardenne started the season on a high note, taking the title in Sydney and then winning her third Grand Slam title at the Australian Open, beating Kim Clijsters in the final. Fabiola Zuluaga and Patty Schnyder enjoyed runs to their first ever Grand Slam semifinals in singles. Schnyder took advantage of an open draw which saw Venus Williams dumped out in the third round by Lisa Raymond, while Zuluaga advanced after Elena Dementieva and Nadia Petrova were early upset victims, and a walkover from Amlie Mauresmo in the quarterfinals. Defending champion Serena Williams withdrew from the tournament due to her continuing recovery from left knee surgery late last year. Henin-Hardenne then won Dubai to build a 16-match win streak, which was snapped by Svetlana Kuznetsova in Doha. Kuznetsova lost to the defending champion Anastasia Myskina in the final. Elsewhere, Lindsay Davenport won her fourth title in Tokyo, tying Martina Hingis for the most wins at the event. Clijsters won the indoor tournaments in Paris and Antwerp, but struggled with injury for the rest of the season. Serena Williams returned in March, winning her first tournament back in Miami, while Henin-Hardenne moved straight back to winning ways, taking the title in Indian Wells. The clay court season saw Davenport and Venus Williams become the first to find success, winning titles in Amelia Island, and Charleston and Warsaw respectively. Mauresmo won the two biggest warm-up tournaments on red clay at Berlin and Rome, with Williams also reaching the final in the former. Mauresmo's feat of winning both events was previously matched by Steffi Graf and Monica Seles, both of whom won the French Open title that same year. However, it proved not to be a good omen for Mauresmo as she lost to Elena Dementieva in the quarterfinals. Clijsters withdrew from the tournament with a wrist injury,[1] while her compatriot Henin-Hardenne, the defending champion, bowed out in the second round with injury against Tathiana Garbin, the earliest loss for the No. 1 seed there since 1925. That upset allowed Paola Surez to reach her first Grand Slam semifinal in singles, where she lost to Dementieva. On the bottom half of the draw, Anastasia Myskina came through after wins over Venus Williams and Jennifer Capriati. The first all-Russian Grand Slam final ended quickly, with Myskina routing a nervous Dementieva to become the first Grand Slam singles champion from Russia. Russian dominance continued in the grass court warmups, with Maria Sharapova winning in Birmingham, and Svetlana Kuznetsova in Eastbourne. Mary Pierce also won her first title since she won the French Open four years previously, winning in 's-Hertogenbosch. Clijsters and Henin-Hardenne sat out the year's third Grand Slam with the same injuries that put them out of the French Open. The first week of Wimbledon saw Venus Williams sent home in the second round by Karolina prem, while the two French Open finalists failed to make the successful transition between clay and grass: Dementieva lost to Sandra Kleinov, and Myskina to Amy Frazier. The final was to be fought between Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, after both made impressive comebacks in their semifinals, coming back from a set and break down.[2][3] In the final, Sharapova upset the two-time defending champion to win her first Grand Slam title, the third youngest winner ever at Wimbledon.[4] Davenport started the summer hardcourt season on a hot streak, winning events in Stanford, Los Angeles, San Diego and Cincinnati to build an impressive winning run going into the year's final Grand Slam. Nicole Vaidiov became one of the youngest tour titlists in history by winning a smaller event in Vancouver, while Mauresmo won the bigger event in Canada, Toronto, beating Elena Likhovtseva in the final. Henin-Hardenne returned from her illness to play the Athens Olympics, where she ended up winning the gold medal over Mauresmo. In the bronze medal match, Alicia Molik beat Myskina. Davenport was the favourite to take her second U.S. Open title, but she was stopped in the semifinals by Svetlana Kuznetsova, who came through a half of upsets which saw Henin-Hardenne lose to Nadia Petrova, and Myskina and Sharapova also lose early. Henin-Hardenne's loss meant that Mauresmo would reach the No. 1 ranking for the first time. On the bottom half of the draw, Elena Dementieva beat Mauresmo and Capriatiwho was coming off a controversial win against Serena Williams in the quarterfinals, in a match with several incorrect line calls going against Williamsto reach her second Grand Slam final. In another all-Russian final, Kuznetsova became the third Russian player to win her maiden Grand Slam in a row. Mauresmo's reign at No. 1 turned out to be short-lived, with Davenport, who won the title in Stuttgart during the fall season, displacing her one month later. Nevertheless, it turned out to be a successful stretch for Mauresmo, who won titles in Linz and Philadelphia. Alicia Molik, won her biggest career title in Zurich and a smaller event in Luxembourg, while Myskina defended her title in Moscow, and Svetlana Kuznetsova won the title in Bali and reached the final in Beijing, losing to Serena Williams. However, it was Maria Sharapova who ended up winning the season-ending WTA Tour Championships, beating Williams in the final, after picking up smaller titles in Seoul and Tokyo, and reaching the final in Zurich. Nadia Petrova and Meghann Shaughnessy won the doubles event. The table below shows the 2004 WTA Tour schedule.
