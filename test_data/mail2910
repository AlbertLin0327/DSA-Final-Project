HMS Loyalist was the sloop Restoration, which the Royal Navy purchased in North America in 1779. She had a burthen of 320 tons and was armed with 14 guns. In May 1781 her captain was Morgan Laugharne.[1] In 1780 Admiral Arbuthnot placed John Plumer Ardesoife in command of Loyalist. He immediately proceeded to terrorize the inhabitants of the Sea Islands, arousing opposition to the British.[2] Around this time Loyalist took the sloop George, of 25 tons burthen, William Stein master. George was condemned at the vice admiralty court in Savannah on 23 August 1780.[3] While under Ardesoife's command she also took some prizes at George Town.[4] She was under the command of Captain Richard Williams when the French captured her in the Chesapeake on 30 August 1781. According to French sources, Loyalist and the frigate Guadeloupe were on picket duty when they encountered the French fleet under Admiral de Grasse. Guadeloupe escaped up the York River to York Town, where she would later be scuttled.[5] The English court martial records report that Loyalist was returning to the British fleet off the Jersey coast when she encountered the main French fleet. The French frigate Aigrette, with the 74-gun Glorieux in sight, was able to overtake Loyalist.[6] The French took her into service as Loyaliste in September, but then gave her to the Americans in November 1781. In her brief French service she is described as carrying 22 guns, probably 14 guns plus eight swivel guns.[5] This article includes data released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported UK: England & Wales License, by the National Maritime Museum, as part of the Warship Histories project
