Roy Mack was the co-owner of the Philadelphia Athletics of the American League with his brother Earle Mack from 1950 through 1954. In 1954, the brothers sold the Athletics to Arnold Johnson, who moved the team to Kansas City, Missouri one season later. Mack was the son of Hall of Fame manager and former Athletics owner Connie Mack. Roy was a graduate of Worcester Academy in Worcester, Massachusetts.
