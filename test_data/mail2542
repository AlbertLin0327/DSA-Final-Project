House temple (Ghar Derasar or Griha Chaityalaya) is a Jain shrine that is placed within a personal residence [1] [2]. Sometimes it is separate room or structure in a compound. Jain scholars prescribe that the height of a pratima in a house shrine should not exceed 11 Agulas, i.e. about 21 cm. The formal communal temple is often referred to as a shikharbandi Jinalaya, i.e. with a shikhara.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
