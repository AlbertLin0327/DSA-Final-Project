Hotel Tycoon Resort is a Business simulation game created and developed by Claw Design Software, published 2010 by eFUSION X. The protagonist is in love with the beautiful daughter of a successful but rigorous hotel magnate. He won't allow them to be together unless the player proves worthy and can show that he is able to manage the big hotel business. The game takes place on several islands. The player can freely create and place pools, restaurants and other buildings, palm trees and a variety of decorations. He can choose to play the story mode consisting of 8 missions or to play the endless mode. The story mode starts with a small mission map and easy tasks introducing the controls and game mechanics. As the missions proceed the tasks become more and more challenging. Hotel guests and their needs are simulated on the maps. Hungry guests start searching for a restaurant for example and will only be satisfied if they are able to find it soon. Thus it's important to plan roads carefully and create buildings to satisfy guests' needs in time. Otherwise guests won't come back. On their route through the hotel park, guests will drop dirt occasionally. Buildings will decay over the time. The player can choose to hire employees to take care of time consuming tasks such as picking up garbage or maintaining and servicing buildings. Additionally he can collect coins that appear randomly on the map. The game consists of 8 missions and an endless game mode. The player can choose between approximately 30 different buildings and decoration objects, which become available as the game proceeds and can be created and placed freely. There are 3 upgrade-levels per building. Hotel Tycoon Resort was rated 8.5 out of 10 by Gamemobile [2] and 6.0 out of 11 (0-10) by Pocketgamer [3]. It is currently the second most popular paid game on BlackBerry AppWorld [4].
