Medal of Honor is a four issue comic book limited series published by Dark Horse Comics from October 1994 through January 1995.[1] Written by Doug Murray, each issue features the stories of several United States soldiers who earned the Medal of Honor during World War II.[1] In addition to the four numbered issues, the series was preceded by an unnumbered issue Medal of Honor: Special in April 1994.[2]
