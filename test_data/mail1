Minas-Rio is an iron ore mining project in Brazil.[1] It is one of the world's largest mining projects, and is initially expected to export 26.5 million tonnes of iron ore in 2013, through a 525km slurry pipeline to a port at Au;[2] production potential is 53 Mtpa or higher.[3] The project was bought by Anglo American PLC, which is facing high costs.[4][5] The mine has certified reserves of 4.6 billion tonnes of itabirite.[6] There have been delays in starting the project, but in December 2010, Anglo American obtained a key license needed from Brazilian government before mining could start.[7][8]
