Autodesk Labs is an online development collaborative where users can see new technologies and utilities from Autodesk and shape their development. Autodesk Labs gives the public free, early access to prototypes, technology previews, and experimental web services so users can provide feedback on product ideas while theyre still in an early conceptual stage. Technologies are typically services that Autodesk Labs visitors can try for their own use. These technologies typically revolve around design creation, management, publishing, visualization, review, printing, or programming. Autodesk Labs visitors can relay the results of their experiences with these services via specific email addresses, discussion forums, or comments posted to blogs. Utilities are typically add-ons or plug-ins to Autodesk design applications such as AutoCAD, Autodesk Inventor, Revit, 3ds Max, or Autodesk Maya. Autodesk Labs visitors download and install these utilities, try them, and provide feedback on their experiences to specific email addresses, discussion forums, or comments posted to blogs. A current list of Autodesk Labs technologies is on the Autodesk Labs site.
