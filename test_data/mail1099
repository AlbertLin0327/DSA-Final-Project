verbygd is a former municipality in Troms county in Norway. It is located in the present-day municipality of Mlselv from the Lille Rostavatn lake along the Mlselva river through the Mlselvdalen valley. The village of Skjold is home to a large garrison for the Norwegian Army. The vre Dividal National Park is also located here. The municipality of verbygd was established on 1 July 1925 when it was separated from the municipality of Mlselv. It had an initial population of 566 inhabitants. On 1 January 1964, verbygd was merged back into a newly enlarged Mlselv municipality. Prior to the merger, verbygd had a population of 1,232.[1][2] During World War II, the German army created a military base at verbygd. The base was initially a supply point for the German forces attack on Murmansk. German soldiers on retreat at the end of the war came through verbygd. Maukstadmoen and Holmen were undeveloped pine forests,but virtually all of the commercial forest was cut down to provide German troops land and building materials. Large barracks for the officer's quarters were established on Maukstadmoen. They also built large stock barracks, a cold storage plant, and a German military hospital. A Prisoner-of-war camp for Russian prisoners of war and medical camp was built near Holmen.
