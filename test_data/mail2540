Magan Airport (ICAO: UEMM) is an airport in Sakha Republic, Russia located 1km east of Magan, Russia. The dirt runway appears to be former concrete runway and is well-maintained. Google Earth high-resolution satellite images shows nearly 100 general aviation propeller-driven planes.[citation needed]
