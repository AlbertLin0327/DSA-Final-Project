Content:
Pommes dauphine (sometimes referred to as dauphine potatoes[1]) are crisp potato puffs made by mixing mashed potatoes with savoury choux pastry, forming the mixture into dumpling shapes, and then deep-frying them at 170 to 180C[1]. The dish is named after the Dauphine, the title given to the wife of the Dauphin, or heir to the French throne. It was highly popular in the 80s. Pommes dauphine typically accompany red meats or chicken[2]. They are normally found in restaurants, although in France they can also be bought in most supermarkets and some bakeries. The home variety can be oven cooked to reduce the amount of oil, which makes them drier. The frozen version can be microwaved as a quick snack. Comparison with similar side dishes Similar potato sides that can be used instead of Pommes Dauphine include Pommes noisette, Pommes duchesse or Pommes souffles. Pommes Dauphines are unique, however, in that they are made from choux pastry, which gives them a lighter density. Pommes noisette have a similar round shape but are only made of potato and are significantly smaller.
