"Good Boys" is a song by the American new wave band Blondie. Released in 2003, it was the only single to be released from their eighth studio album The Curse of Blondie. The single peaked at number 12 in the UK and was the final single from the band for eight years. The single was released as part of a two-CD set and on vinyl. CD 1 features live versions of "Maria" and "Rapture", plus the video for "Good Boys" directed by Jonas kerlund. CD 2 featured a remix by Giorgio Moroder. The 12-inch vinyl featured remixes by Giorgio Moroder, Return To New York, and Scissor Sisters. The Australian single release coincided with the band's 2003 tour of the country, peaking at number 37 and becoming their first top 40 hit there as a group since "Island of Lost Souls" in 1982. The song credits Brian May of the British rock band Queen as a co-writer because Debbie Harry wanted to use lyrics that were similar to those of Queen's 1977 hit "We Will Rock You" for the rap section. Although the lyrics are not entirely identical, Queen threatened to sue,[citation needed] as was explained by Harry and fellow Blondie member Chris Stein on a VH1 special.[citation needed] The lyrics used in "Good Boys" were "You got me on your face / A big disgrace / Shakin' your feathers all over the place." The lyrics from "We Will Rock You" are "You got mud on your face / You big disgrace / Kicking your can all over the place." The music video for "Good Boys", is mostly filmed in black and white, and is made to resemble a type of story or, to make a point. In this case, the point is that "Good Boys never win". The video starts out as an old silent film, with a title screen that presents the band, the song, and the director. Then, the title page cuts out, and the music starts, with a clown, that is part of the setting of a circus, at which the video hails as it's main character. The next parts of the video follows as brunette Debbie, who apparently plays ringmaster, and her band play the song in an old picture form, as well as continues the story of the main character. The clown at which loves one of the other circus performers, a young girl, in fact. When declaring his love for her to everyone there, he skips off to see her, only to find out that she was with another clown. Then, he gets very upset at her new man, and plots his revenge. At this point, the infamous bridge has arrived, and that's when there are full color flash-ins of Debbie rocking out and singing the bridge, as the intense part of the story arrives. Debbie's color form only appears during the bridge, so after the bridge she's gone, for now. During that part, the clown see's the other clown, and so, he hides. When his enemy gets close enough, he pounces on him, and they fight. At the end if that, the clown's enemy throws him into a tiger cage, at which he then gets mulled by the tiger, and the other clown gets away. At thus point, black and white Debbie seems as if she is dancing on his ashes, as he gets mulled. Towards the end of the last chorus, Debbie's color form has returned and starts singing again. At which, then, when the clown becomes motionless, it takes the screaming crowd almost everyone to drag him out of the cage. The young girl meets him at his side, while the crownd watches in horror, as he draws his last bits of energy. He says he loves her one more time, and he gives her his red heart, at which he dies. The girl starts to cry, as the music fades out and Debbie delivers her last dance. Then, she puts her head on the clown's chest, and declares that she loves him too. Then, the video concludes, as the caption, "We love -- and die -- because we must", comes onto the screen, and then, the video ends. Therefore, the clown in white clothing is the "good boy" in the video, at which he never wins due to his death, and the clown in black clothing is the "bad boy", at which he gets away, and so he would win. The music video was directed by Jonas kerlund. All tracks (Harry/Griffin/May) unless otherwise noted.
