Rev. John Cox Edghill DD[1] (known as Cox;[2] 1835[3] - 1917[4]) was a British Anglican priest, senior chaplain at Aldershot from 1861, then followed chaplain to the forces at Chatham, Halifax (Nova Scotia), again at Aldershot, Gibraltar, and, finally, at Portsmouth (1881-5), and then Chaplain-General to Her Majesty's Forces (18851901).[5][6] Following his retirement, he undertook the position of Prebendary of Wells, which he held until his death.[2] As a noted Tractarian and Anglo-Catholic, he was the first choice to replace Hibbert Binney as the bishop of Nova Scotia by the Synod of the diocese, at Halifax, 6 June 1887. He declined his election in a letter to the Synod.[5][7] He had a daughter, Ella Mary Edghill, with Mary Nesfield[8] (d. 24 September 1922, Weston-super-Mare).[9] The Museum of Army Chaplaincy holds further information on the life on Edghill.
