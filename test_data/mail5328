Isisford is a small town located in Central West Queensland, Australia. It is located on the Barcoo River, and is approximately 120 kilometres south east of the town of Longreach. At the 2006 census, Isisford and the surrounding area had a population of 262.[1] This figure has never surpassed 300.[3] The first European in the area was the explorer Thomas Mitchell, who travelled through the area in 1846. Settlers followed and established a township in the 1870s.[3] In the late 1870s, the town was named after a nearby ford on the Barcoo, and because the Isis Downs property was in proximity to it. In 1878 the town was surveyed. A post office and telegraph line were operating by 1881.[3] In the following years the town progressed with the growth of the pastoral industry.[3] Media related to Isisford, Queensland at Wikimedia Commons
