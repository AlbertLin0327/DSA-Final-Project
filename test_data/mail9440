HMS B7 was a Royal Navy B class submarine, built at Vickers, Barrow-in-Furness, launched 30 November 1905 and completed 27 March 1906. B7 was deployed to the Mediterranean soon after the outbreak of World War I. Due to the lack of spare parts this group of submarines was not used after September 1915. In 1917 the Italian Navy converted B7 into to surface patrol boat S7 to serve in the Adriatic. B7 was sold on 31 October 1919 in Malta.
