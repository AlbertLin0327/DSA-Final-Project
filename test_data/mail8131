Peterborough & Fletton United F.C. was an English football club based in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. The club existed from 1923 until 1932 and played at London Road. The club was established in 1923 by a merger of Peterborough City and Fletton United.[1] Peterborough City had spent a single season in the Southern League in 190910 but then left the league.[2] The new club joined the Southern League in 1923 and won the Eastern Section in their first season. However, they lost the championship play-off against Western Section champions Yeovil & Petters United 31.[3] In 192728 they reached the third round of the FA Cup, where they lost 43 at Birmingham City. At the end of the season they applied for the elections to Division Three South of the Football League, but received only two votes.[4] After finishing eighth out of ten clubs in 193132 they left the Southern League,[5] and subsequently folded after being suspended by the Football Association.[6] Peterborough United were formed to replace them in 1934.[7]
