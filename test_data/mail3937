"Broken Wings" is the title of a song recorded by American pop/rock band Mr. Mister. The band's first single from their 1985 Welcome to the Real World album, "Broken Wings" reached the number-one position on the U.S. charts in December 1985, where it remained for two weeks. It was released as the band was just about to embark on a U.S. tour opening for Tina Turner. The song reached number four in the UK Singles Chart, the highest the group ever achieved there. The song was co-written with lyricist John Lang, who was inspired by a book called "Broken Wings" written by Kahlil Gibran.[1] The song is a mix of synth, digitally delayed guitar, bass and drums. The song's hissing intro was an effect created by the sound of crash cymbal played in reverse.[1] The music video for "Broken Wings" was directed by Oley Sassone and filmed in black & white.[2] It features lead vocalist/bassist Richard Page driving through the desert in a classic Ford Thunderbird, the first allusion to birds. There is a scene where Page is sitting in a church when a Harris's Hawk flies in through the window and lands next to him on the pew and they exchange a gaze. The full band is also featured in performance scenes. Also appearing in the video are an unknown man and woman dancing tango. They are only shown from the waist down. At the end of the video Page is seen next to the Thunderbird with the vehicle's hood open, symbolizing broken wings.
