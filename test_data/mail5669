Alois Kayser (March 29, 1877 in Lupstein/Alsace  October 21, 1944 in Chuuk) was a German/French Roman Catholic missionary who spent almost 40 years on Nauru and wrote a Nauruan grammar (and possibly a Nauruan language dictionary). In 1943 he was deported along with most of the Nauruan population by the Japanese to Micronesia, where he died. In his honour the government of Nauru named the technical school in the district Ewa after him.
