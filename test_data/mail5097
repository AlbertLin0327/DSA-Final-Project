KRQQ is an FM radio station in Tucson, Arizona, which is licensed to broadcast on the frequency of 93.7MHz with a power of 96,000 watts, and is owned by Clear Channel Communications. Its transmitter is on Tower Peak in the Tucson Mountains and the signal is mildly directional to avoid overlap KDKB in Phoenix, Arizona, under FCC rules that were in effect when the antenna was erected. Oddly enough, this is not vice versa. Known as 93.7 KRQ, the station plays Top 40 (CHR) music, and its primary audience or demographic is teens and young adults. KRQQ began its life as KXEW-FM, a Spanish station which also aired some bilingual programming especially in the evenings, and was purchased by Western Cities Broadcasting, which made it a top 40 station in July 1977. The station was sold to Nationwide Communications in the 1980s. According to radio industry trade publication Radio and Records, during the late 1980s, KRQQ was the highest-rated Top 40 station in the United States under its then program director Clarke Ingram. Nationwide later sold its Tucson stations to Tucson Radio Partners, which in turn was absorbed by Prism Radio and then Clear Channel Communications in the 1990s. The radio station is currently one of the best rated Top 40 stations in Arizona. The 1991 slogan was Tucson's only hit music station. KRQ's middays (10am-2pm) are hosted by Ryan Seacrest (syndicated). The main afternoon drive feature is the "Drive at 5" with Chris P. (2pm-7pm).[1] Nights, along with the Top 8 @ 8, are hosted by Joe Joe (7pm-2am).[2] Overnights (2am-5am) are voice tracked by L.A.-based host Sisanie.[3] The current morning show on KRQ is Johnjay and Rich, which has been on the air since 2001. Johnjay and Rich were syndicated to Clear Channel-owned 104.7 KISS FM in Phoenix in January 2006. Coincidentally, the Program Director at 104.7 KISS FM at the time was a former employee of KRQ. For the first couple years, the show would split broadcasting time between Tucson and Phoenix, but since mid-2008, the show has been broadcast live almost exclusively from Phoenix. The show has been very successful in both the Phoenix and Tucson markets. The show is now also broadcast on Z-100 in Portland, Oregon, My 99.9 in Colorado Springs, Colorado, 96.1 KISS FM in Fort Collins, Colorado, and on 93.1 All The Hits in Las Vegas, Nevada. The show was balanced out with a female co-star Carrie Moten who seemed to keep the boys in line, who quit in 2009 and can now be heard as a news anchor on 92.3 FM, a News/Talk station in Phoenix. In December 2009 after hosting auditions for another co-host replacement, KRQ hired Kyle Unfug aka Special K. The Johnjay and Rich morning show features a different segment every morning. Monday: After This Weekend, I'll Never Do "Blank" Again, Meeting in the Ladies Room Tuesday: Second-Date Update Wednesday: Confession Wednesday Thursday: War of the Roses Friday: I knew it was over when, Whatcha Doin At The Courthouse? Previous morning shows have included Mojo (Now at Channel 9-5-5 in Detroit and syndicated on KOHT) and Betsy, and the team of Mike Elliott and Jimmy Kimmel. KRQQ is subscribed to syndicated radio show Saturday Night Online hosted by Romeo on Saturday nights from 7 P.M.-Midnight MST, and Sunday nights feature Kid Kelly's Backtrax USA, which is an all-90's music syndicated show. It replaced Rick Dees's Weekly Top 40 when all Clear Channel CHR stations unsubscribed from it. Saturday mornings feature the FOX All Access show and Ryan Seacrest's AT40. KRQ was previously subscribed to AT40 when it used to be hosted by Casey Kasem and Open House Party hosted by John Garabedian. Music on the station stays within the CHR genre. However, their playlist moves with the audience. During the daytime, the playlist consists of mostly mainstream CHR songs, Hot AC, and strong golds, being light on urban and rhythmic. During the late afternoon, evening, and overnight hours, the playlist is much heavier on urban and rhythmic tracks, with mainstream songs mixed in. KRQ also includes a very strong 'gold' and 'recurrent' tracks mixed in the playlist, mostly during the daytime.. Bob Pittman (CEO, CC Media Holdings, Inc.)
