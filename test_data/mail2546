Sawtooth Peak is a jagged mountain rising to a height of 12,343 feet (3,762m).[1] It is an iconic landmark of the Mineral King region of the Sierra Nevada, in Sequoia National Park. In the past, it was known as Miner's Peak.[6] It contains an abundant supply of gold and mercury. The easiest approach is from the valley to Sawtooth Pass, and then up the northwest slope of the peak.[5] It was first known to be climbed by Joseph Lovelace during a deer hunt in 1871.[6] Today, this approach follows an established trail to Sawtooth Pass, then continues on a cross-country route to the peak. The section of trail from Monarch Lakes to Sawtooth Pass is steep and marred by granite sand, and as such is prone to erosion. The trailhead, shared with the Timber Gap trail, is located in the Mineral King Valley, about 1/2 mile uphill from the Ranger Station. It starts at 7,500 feet (2,300m), is approximately 7 miles (10km) round trip, and the route reaches a final elevation of 12,343 feet (3,762m) at the peak.
