"3-Tage-Bart" [Designer stubble; lit: 3-days-beard] is a punk song by Die rzte. It's the fourth track and the first single from their 1996 album Le Frisur. The song is about a man, who has everything he may want and need, but he's missing one thing - the stubble. In the video Die rzte are running and jumping on a beach, obviously happy and on the other hand performing some kind of dance, singing the song in another location. The video very often jumps between those two locations. The video was filmed in Spain, during a tour break, and is released on the Killer DVD.  Sahnie Richy Guitar
