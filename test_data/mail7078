"More Life in a Tramp's Vest" is the second single from the rock band Stereophonics. The song is taken from the band's debut album, Word Gets Around and was released in May 1997. It reached #33 on the UK Singles Chart. The song is about life from the view of supermarket bag boy. [1] The single's B-side, Raymond's Shop is featured on Stereophonics' greatest hits compilation album Decade in the Sun. The video shows various activities (such as shopping, riding a bus, playing football), but everyone has televisions for heads, which show many different things. The only people who don't have televisions for head are the band, who are shown performing on pointing traffic signs.
