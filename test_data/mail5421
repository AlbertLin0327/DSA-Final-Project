Joseph Ady (17701852) was a notorious English impostor. He was at one time a hatter in London, but failing in that business he hit upon the device of raising funds by means of circular letters, promising, on the receipt of a suitable fee, to inform those whom he addressed of something to their advantage. In numerous instances he evaded the law and baffled the magistrates and post-office authorities. For some months previous to his death in 1852, he was removed from prison to his brother's residence in Fenchurch Street, in consequence of a rapid decline of health, a memorial to that effect having been presented to the home secretary.
