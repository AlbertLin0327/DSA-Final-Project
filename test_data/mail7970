In martial arts, blocking is the act of stopping or deflecting an opponent's attack for the purpose of preventing injurious contact with the body. A block usually consists of placing a limb across the line of the attack. Styles and types of blocking, as well as terminology, vary widely among the various martial arts. In Japanese martial arts such as Karate, these techniques are referred to as uke waza. Examples include age uke (rising block) and shuto uke (knife hand guarding block). In Korean martial arts such as Taekwondo, these techniques are referred to as makgi, with some examples being chukyeo makgi (rising block) and sonkal daebi makgi (knifehand guarding block). Simple blocks are usually the first to be taught to beginning students in a martial art, and can be as effective in combat situations as more complex moves. The details of blocks vary from style to style, but broadly blocks can be split in to two types: inside and outside. An inside block deflects a strike away from the defender. For example, against a straight punch to the face, an inside forearm block would aim to meet the inside of the forearm of the attacker, pushing the punch outward, leaving the opponents facing each other which also helps in counter attack. An outside block deflects a strike away from the defender and across the attacker. For example, against a straight punch to the face, an outside forearm block would aim to meet the outside forearm of the attacker, pushing the punch outward, leaving the defender slightly to the side of the strike causing it to miss. Typically, because of the angles involved, inward blocks are used against attacks aimed at the torso; although they can be used to defend any area, these usually require a movement from the defender. Executed correctly, this kind of block can create a good opening for a counter-attack. For example, if an attacker were to aim a right-handed punch at an opponent's torso, if the opponent side-stepped left and used his left hand to strike the outside of the attacker's punching arm to the right, this would leave the attacker off-axis, off-balance, and facing at an approximate angle of 45 degrees to the left of where he intended to be when the punch was thrown. This would leave the whole right hand side of the attacker's body open, whereupon his opponent could then choose from a range of counter attacks, such as a knee kick, a roundhouse kick to the floating ribs, or an elbow strike to the head or ribs, all of which would inflict serious damage. A high block deflects a downward strike such as a hammer fist, a stick or a face punch from a taller opponent. The chamber starts low with the hand in a relaxed fist across the abdomen with the palm facing inward. As the arm is raised above the head, the palm is forcefully turned outward and the arm fist are tensed. The arm should be at a 45 degree angle from the ground to deflect the strike. A low block deflects an inward strike directed at the stomach or ribs such as a roundhouse kick. The chamber starts with the forearm across the chest, the hand in a loose fist, and the palm facing upwards towards the cheek. As the arm is lowered and passes the outside of the abdomen, the palm is turned forcefully downwards and the fist and arm are tensed. Parries are executed when an opponent punches or kicks you and you will quickly push their arm or leg away to the right or left side(as it is considered as a block) and counterattacking when the procedure is done. Parries need right timing with an attacking opponent or they will be the one to strike instead. More complex blocks include the circular block, X block, high X block, twin forearm guarding block, hooking block, and pole block. Offensive techniques can also be used to block. For example, a kick or palm strike can be used to neutralize an incoming blow. It is also common to use the knee to block leg attacks from an opponent. A knee block, however, is ineffective when dealing with side kicks and any kick in which the heel of the foot is used and may result in damage to the knee. Blocks are considered by some to be the most direct and least subtle of defensive techniques. Other ways of avoiding attack include evasion, trapping, slipping and deflection of the oncoming attack; this approach is often referred to as the application of 'soft' techniques (see hard and soft (martial arts)). Sometimes, it is more useful to deflect an attack, as it may leave the opponent open for a counter-attack. Some martial arts, such as T'ai chi ch'uan and Capoeira, reject blocking techniques completely as they consider them too inefficient. In Capoeira, they use evasion instead of blocking.
