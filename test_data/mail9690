The Brest Arsenal (French - arsenal de Brest) is a collection of naval and military buildings located on the banks of the river Penfeld, in Brest, France. It is located at 482312N 42948W / 48.38667N 4.49667W / 48.38667; -4.49667Coordinates: 482312N 42948W / 48.38667N 4.49667W / 48.38667; -4.49667. The Penfeld, within the military enclosure, is almost wholly lined with quays, but ships cannot come directly alongside these quays because of heads of rock that are left exposed at low tide. That's why floating stages are moored fore and aft, mainly on the left bank, to make up postes where some small ships can come alongside and use some installations such as the large crane. Little used upstream of the Pont de Recouvrance, downstream of this bridge these postes nevertheless serve the old sailing ships of the Navy, the tugboats and other support boats of the arsenal, and transrades, passenger ships which provide a service across the roadstead (rade de Brest) between Brest and the Crozon peninsula (le Longue, cole Navale)
