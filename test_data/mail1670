Roubini Global Economics or RGE (formerly known as RGE Monitor), is a global economic and financial analysis firm based in New York City. The company also has offices in London and New Delhi. RGE Monitor, as the company was known then, was founded in 2004 by Dr. Nouriel Roubini, former senior adviser to the U.S. Treasury and the International Monetary Fund and a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. The company re-branded itself as Roubini Global Economics (RGE) in 2010 and now has offices in New York, London and New Delhi, and includes a staff of several dozen in-house economists and analysts. Dr. Roubini serves as Chairman for the company, provides direction to the analytical team, and regularly publishes his own writings to the site through his "EconoMonitor," one of several economic blogs housed on the site. RGE's online product is focused on macroeconomic, financial, geo-strategic, and geo-political topics and includes original analysis of the world's most important economies and asset classes. In addition, RGE's analysts consult with clients directly, and on a daily basis compile region- and topic-specific summaries and collections of references to external content judged relevant to its clients. Limited access to the site is available for free. Paid/Premium subscriptions allow for full access and are targeted at asset managers, hedge funds, commercial banks, investment banks, central banks and other policy organizations, and universities. Free trials to the premium product can be requested through the site. RGE's CEO is Dean Daniels,[1] formerly of the consultancy Gartner and once news director of WCBS-TV in New York. The market research team is headed by Italian-born economist Christian Menegatti, Managing Director of Global Economic Research, and Arnab Das, Managing Director of Market Research and Strategy (based in London).
