Oakwood Cemetery is a 160-acre (65ha) historic cemetery located in Syracuse, New York. It was designed by Howard Daniels and built in 1859. Oakwood Cemetery was created during a time period in the nineteenth century when the rural cemetery was becoming a distinct landscape type, and is a good example of this kind of landscape architecture.[2] The original 92 acres (37ha) included about 60 acres (24ha) of dense oak forest with pine, ash, hickory and maple. A crew of 60 laborers without large-scale earth moving equipment thinned and grouped the trees; today there are many 150-year old specimens. Students of SUNY-ESF, whose campus is adjacent to Oakwood, can regularly be seen in the cemetery for instruction on plant species or capturing insect specimens.[2] Oakwood was an immediate success after its dedication in November, 1859. Thousands of visitors led to the establishment of omnibus service directly to the cemetery gates. Additions to the original acreage were laid out in a manner sympathetic to the original design.[2] Oakwood Cemetery in Syracuse - 1909 - Chapel The Soldier's and Sailor's Plot Grave of a Union Army soldier who was killed at the Battle of Appomattox Courthouse near the end of the American Civil War Oakwood Cemetery in Syracuse - 1920 - Chapel
