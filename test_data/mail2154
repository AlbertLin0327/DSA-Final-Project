Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Connecticut, is a community hospital serving people in lower Fairfield County and in lower Westchester County New York. A member of the Yale New Haven Health System, Greenwich Hospital is a teaching institution. It has an internal medicine residency program, and is a major academic affiliate of the Yale University School of Medicine. The hospital is also affiliated with New York Medical College School of Medicine, Antioch College, Columbia University School of Social Work, Fairfield University School of Nursing and Graduate School of Education, Hunter College Graduate School of Social Work, Norwalk Community College, Pace University, and Westchester Community College. In 2005, the hospital admitted 11,881 in-patients (a 7.4 increase over the previous year) and 178,021 out-patients, according to one source[1], although the hospital itself puts the 2005 "outpatient volume" at 404,834 visits, for a 7.4 percent increase over the previous year.[2] The percentage of patients from New York state has grown from 15.7 percent in 1998 to nearly 40 percent in 2006.[2] A competing hospital across the border in Port Chester, New York went out of business in 2005, which could account for a good portion of the increase in patients from New York state, although the numbers coming over the border had been increasing for years. The hospital's emergency department handled 35,841 patient visits in 2005.[2] Greenwich Hospital has 32 medical sub-departments, including cardiology, oncology, orthopedics, obstetrics, occupational medicine and home care. The hospital has the Bendheim Cancer Center, the Center for Healthy Aging, and the Healthy Living Center. The 9.2-acre (37,000 m2) main campus of the hospital is on Perryridge Road.[2] The hospital is located on a 9-acre (36,000 m2) campus on Perryridge Road, northwest of downtown Greenwich.[3] To the southwest of the main hospital building, across the traffic circle (at the intersection of Perryridge Road, Lake Avenue, Lafayette Place and William Street) is the Sherman and Gloria H. Cohen Pavilion, which houses the Bendheim Cancer Center, a comprehensive Breast Center, and parking for outpatients. The hospital has an Endoscopy Center at 500 W. Putnam Ave., and a Healthy Living Center and IVF services at 55 Holly Hill Lane. At 2015 West Main St. on the Stamford-Greenwich border, the hospital has a diagnostic center and a community wellness department, "Greenwich Health at Greenwich Hospital." In addition, the Greenwich Hospital Center for Integrative Medicine offers patients a blend of conventional and alternative medical therapies. The hospital is licensed as an acute care facility by the state Department of Public Health & Addiction Services. Greenwich Hospital has 472 physicians[2] and 1,821 employees overall.[1] Frank A. Corvino is president of the hospital, which is a nonprofit institution (as are all hospitals in the state), governed by a volunteer board of trustees. Visitors to the main entrance go into a two-story foyer with a fountain and piano.[2] After being chartered in 1903, the hospital began service on September 12, 1906 in the Octagon House on Milbank Avenue with four attendings, ten consulting doctors, two nursing staff and seven student nurses.[4] At that time the hospital had 24 beds.[2] In 1914 Commodore Elias C. Benedict, a town resident, offered to partly finance the building of a new hospital building on Perryridge Road. The first building was felt by many to be inadequate. One of the people influential in suggesting the gift to Benedict was Luke Vincent Lockwood, Benedict's lawyer and a close friend of hospital founder Dr. Fritz Carleton Hyde. Initially, there was public resistance to the proposed building, with some saying it was too big for the community. World War I delayed construction, although in October 1917 the new facility opened in time to be used in the serious influenza epidemic the following year.[4] Growing demand for hospital services meant that a new building was opened on Perry Lane on May 5, 1951. Over the years new wings were added to that building, with the last addition being the South Wing in 1965.[4] In 1998, the hospital affiliated itself with the Yale-New Haven Health System.[4] Again the hospital outgrew its building, and a campaign was started to finance a new building. Groundbreaking took place in 1997 and in 1999 the new hospital building opened.[4] In the fall of 2005, Greenwich Hospital completed construction on its main campus with the opening of the Thomas and Olive C. Watson Pavilion. The Leona and Harry B. Helmsley Medical Building, the hospital's main building, opened in 1999. A 10-year building program was to come to an end in September 2006 with the scheduled dedication of the Carl and Dorothy Bennett Garden at the southern end of the hospital's main campus.[2] In November 2007 the hospital applied to the state for permission to offer hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The hospital planned to buy two oxygen chambers for $267,000 and spend an additional $775,000 in construction for the program. A detailed certificate of need was to be submitted to the state Office of Health Care Access between February 3 and April 3, 2008. Norwalk Hospital, Bridgeport Hospital and five other hospitals in Connecticut had hyperbaric programs as of November 2007.[5] The main entrance is on the west side of Perryridge, with the "Helmsley Medical Building" consisting of the north end of the structure and the "Watson Pavilion" the south end. Both ends of the main building are five stories high, including an underground two-floor parking garage. The main entrance leads into a three-story "Atrium Lobby". From the front of the building, the main entrance separates the Helmsley Medical Building (to the right) from the Watson Pavilion (to the left as well as behind the lobby). The visitor parking entrance is on Perryridge Road, to the left of the main entrance. The Emergency Department entrance is at the southern end of the main building, on Lake Avenue. Staff parking is to the west of the Emergency entrance, also on Lake Avenue. According to the Greenwich Times of July 27, 2011, Greenwich Hospital will lay off 36 employees and shutter a dental clinic and integrative medicine facility, amongst others. It should also be noted that although a Meditech information systems facility, Greenwich is joining Yale New Haven Health Systems in the rollout of an information system called EPIC for approximately two hundred fifty million dollars.[citation needed] Olive and Thomas J.
