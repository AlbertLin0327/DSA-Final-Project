The Shire of Murrindindi is a Local Government Area in Victoria, Australia. It is located in the north-eastern part of the state, and includes the towns of Alexandra, Eildon, Kinglake and Yea. It has an area of 3,889 square kilometres, and at the 2006 Census it had a population of 13,672. The shire is named after the locality of Murrindindi which is near its geographical centre. Other minor towns within the shire include Kinglake West, Flowerdale, Strath Creek, Highlands, Molesworth, Yarck, Thornton, Taggerty, Glenburn, Toolangi, Buxton, Marysville and Narbethong. It was formed in 1994 from the merger of the Shire of Alexandra, Shire of Yea and parts of the Shire of Broadford, Shire of Eltham, Shire of Euroa, Shire of Healesville and City of Whittlesea. Parts of Murrindindi were badly affected by the 2009 Victorian bushfires, notably the towns of Marysville and Kinglake. 106 people lost their lives across the Shire that day, including 38 in Kinglake and 34 in Marysville. Each ward is represented by one elected Councillor. List of localities (Victoria) Coordinates: 372000S 1453000E / 37.3333333S 145.5E / -37.3333333; 145.5
