Pi Kappa Lambda is an American honor society for undergraduate students, graduate students, and professors of music. There are currently 205 active chapters and approximately 64,500 individual members. Pi Kappa Lambda was established on May 17, 1918 at the Northwestern University by Carl Milton Beecher, Louis Norton Dodge, and Walter Allen Stults. The first member was Peter Christian Lutkin, Dean of the School of Music at Northwestern University, and the Greek letters chosen for the name of the society were based on his initials. Pi Kappa Lambda joined the Association of College Honor Societies in 1940. Its current national headquarters are located at Capital University in Columbus, Ohio.
