"Losing Grip" is a song by Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne released as the fourth and last single from her multiplatinum debut album Let Go (except in Australia and New Zealand where "Mobile" was released). It was released in late spring of 2003 after the success of "I'm with You". The song was written and produced by Avril Lavigne and C. Magness. The song is much heavier with grunge[2] oriented sounds, than most of the songs on Let Go that had a more poppy feel. She performed 'Losing Grip' at the Juno Awards of 2003. It is about Lavigne "losing grip" with her boyfriend as they are just not meant to be. The single was certified Gold by the RIAA on September 22, 2003[3] The music video shows Lavigne performing in front of a large crowd. Shots of her making her way through a mass of people while pushing, punching and shoving interlude from time to time. There is also a scene where Lavigne jumps into the crowd and "crowd surfs". The audience had to practice this routine on other people before Lavigne was allowed to do so. The music video was directed by Liz Friedlander. Christina Saraceno of Allmusic noted that 'Losing Grip' allowed Lavigne to "show off" her vocal ability during the song's "explosive rock chorus".[4] Sal Cinquemani of Slant magazine also praised Lavigne's vocals and compared them to Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette.[5] In an AOL Radio listener's poll, "Losing Grip" was voted Lavigne's tenth best song.[6] "Losing Grip" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, but lost to "Trouble" by P!nk.
