Anna Carin Zidek (born 1 April 1973 in Sveg, Hrjedalen; maiden name: Anna Carin Helena Cecilia Olofsson; full name: Anna Carin Helena Cecilia Zidek) is a Swedish former biathlete who won a silver medal in the 7.5km sprint and a gold medal in the 12.5km mass start event at the 2006 Winter Olympics. Originally a cross-country skier, Olofsson competed at the 2002 Winter Olympics, but in the three events she took part in she made the top 30 only once (15km freestyle), and the following season she switched to biathlon. On May 3, 2008, Olofsson married her then boyfriend, Tom Zidek - a serviceman in the Canadian biathlon team - in a ceremony near Canmore, Canada. Olofsson officially announced her retirement on July 16, 2011.
