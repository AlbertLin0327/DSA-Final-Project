Surrounding neighborhoods include Alamitos bay on the south, University Park Estates to the east, Park Estates and the Recreation Park to the north, and Belmont Heights to the west. Alamitos Beach, several miles west, is not contiguous; the neighborhood gained its name from Alamitos bay, not the beach.
