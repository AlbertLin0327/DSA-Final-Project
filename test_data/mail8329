Sally Louise Fletcher (ne Copeland, previously Keating) is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Home and Away, played by Kate Ritchie. She was the longest running original female cast member appearing from the Pilot episode on 17 January 1988 until 3 April 2008. Ritchie earned various awards and nominations for her portrayal of Sally. Ritchie auditioned for the role of Sally in front of executive producer John Holmes in 1987.[1] Her audition scene was all about strawberry jam and Sally's imaginary friend Milco.[1][2] Ritchie told Jason Herbison of All About Soap that she could remember reading Sally's scenes for Holmes, before auditioning for the director who recorded it on video.[2] She added "I remember when my mum told me I got the part of Sally. I didn't want her to tell anyone because I was really embarrassed."[2] Holmes revealed Ritchie had stood out among the other actresses auditioning for the role. He said "Actors always choose themselves for a role and in this case Kate Ritchie shone head and shoulders above all the rest."[1] During flashbacks to the character's childhood, Sally was played by Chloe Shelsher.[3] Kate Ritchie said of her role, "I well and truly know the girl that is Sally Fletcher. If only I had realised earlier she wasn't my enemy, she wasn't the embarrassing little sister always trying to spoil my fun but, in fact, the best friend I ever had....In my Logie acceptance speech last year I said Home and Away had always been my constant and the same goes for Sally. We have spent the past 20 years side by side....Sally is a good person. She is the true meaning of the word good, often a quality that goes unnoticed and is most definitely underrated. Sounds crazy, but it is true."[4] After twenty years, Ritchie departed Home and Away. Her last episode as Sally was shown on 3 April 2008. As Farah Farouque wrote, "the last episode featuring Sally is a TV moment of note."[5] Twins Sally and Miles lived together with their alcoholic father Aaron Copeland (Timothy Walter) and mother Diana Copeland. Aaron used to beat Diana, so she left him and took Sally with her. Diana and new husband Derek Wilson had been killed in a boating accident. She went to live with her grandmother Mrs Keating, but she developed Alzheimer's Disease and could not look after her. Sally was soon fostered by Tom and Pippa Fletcher. In the confusion that was her early childhood, Sally forgot about her brother and father. However she had an imaginary friend named Milco that she had invented to help herself cope with her losses. What nobody at the time knew though was that Milco was in fact the nickname of Sally's twin. Aaron and Miles went to find Sally, but after seeing Sally was better of with the Fletcher family, they left. Sally was one of Tom and Pippa's original foster children when they moved to Summer Bay, along with Carly Lucini, Steven Matheson, Frank Morgan, and Lynn Davenport. She would remain a mainstay in the family as others came and went around her. Of the others, she was closest to Sophie Simpson, Sam Marshall, and Shannon Reed. Her other close childhood friend was Lance Smart, who lived with his mother in a mobile home at the caravan park. Unlike the other children, they adopt Sally. Not long after however Tom died. A year later, Pippa remarried to Michael Ross. After an uncomfortable start, Sally accepted him but it was not unknown for her to remind him she had been part of the family longer than he had. More tragedy was to follow for the family with the deaths of Sally's adoptive brother Dale, a victim of sudden infant death syndrome, and her foster sister Bobby Marshall in a boating accident. Sally's first crush was on Damian Roberts, her foster brother, and she even went as far as to kiss him while he lay sleeping. She seemed more likely to succeed with Joe Lynch, a boy in the year above her. Although he initially seemed interested, when he found out Sally, who was taking maths classes with the year ahead, was a favourite of his mother Teresa, the school's deputy head, he took against her on principle, bullying and humiliating her at every opportunity. It took a long time for Sally to make anyone realise what was going on but finally succeeded when Donald Fisher caught Joe in the act of throwing ink into her locker (Sally eventually forgave Joe, although only after some much deserved payback). Sally's first boyfriend was Gus Bishop, the younger brother of her teacher Donna, but his wild boy antics, including setting fire to Jack Wilson's, guitar soon proved too much for her. She later dated Nelson MacFarlane, Irene Roberts' nephew, but although they seemed happy together he was quick to cut her out when he was badly burned in a fire and had to leave town for treatment. Ironically Sally then started seeing Jack, who was partly to blame for the fire. However, when Sally wanted to let Brendan, a troubled young man who had abandoned his baby, use the caravan that Michael and Pippa had given them for privacy Jack refused. Sally was annoyed by his selfishness and broke up with him. She encounters Moss, a man staying at the caravan park who believed she was the reincarnation of his daughter who had died seventeen years earlier, in a car accident when he had been driving. Certain evidence seemed to back up his claim: Sally remembered the song he used to sing her to her, even though she had never heard it before, and said goodbye to him in exactly the same way. When Sally and Shannon went for a drive with Moss, they found themselves reliving the accident, when another car forced them off the road. (The driver was never revealed although there is some speculation, unsupported by on screen evidence, that it was her former foster brother Dodge, who had apparently died the previous year but whose body had never been found.) This time, however, Moss made sure he was the one who died. Sally saw this as him being given a second chance to save her life. Soon after, Michael drowned while saving Sam's life and Sally (who had once run away from home when Michael and Pippa seemed to be splitting up) lost a 'father' for the fourth time. Sal had always suffered from low self-esteem and began to feel unattractive and unliked with no close friends. Despite campaigning hard for a representative school council, she was passed over by her peers for a place on it. She made a play for Curtis Reed, who didn't even seem to notice, then let another boy, Charlie, kiss her even though she didn't like him. Finally in an attempt to cheer her up Shannon and Selina took her for a trip on a raft that Liam Tanner and Joey Rainbow had made from polystyrene. It sank and Sally was separated from the others. She was found by Jamie Grace, a backwards man who had been living as a virtual hermit since he was forced out of town for inadvertently causing a boy's death. Sally spent days effectively trapped in the woods, suffering from a fever and unable to convince Jamie of the seriousness of her condition, until she was finally rescued by Steven. Sally began seeing Tim O'Connor and became closer to him than any other boyfriend previous, losing her virginity to him. However, he was then arrested when it was found he had been helping smuggle in illegal immigrants (his Vietnamese stepmother's family rather than for profit). Having lost the person she was closest to, Sally self-destructed, hanging out with bad boy Scott Irwin (played by Heath Ledger), sleeping with him and using Pippa's position as school secretary to steal exam papers for him. Her already strong sense of guilt was compounded when Tim returned to town, the charges having been dropped. Angry at Sally for getting them caught, Scott stole from Donald Fisher's office and planted the items in Sally's locker to frame her. However, Aaron Welles saw what he was doing and moved them to Scott's locker so he was caught and expelled. When Scott attacked Sally in the surf club for revenge, Tim came to her rescue and the pair were reconciled. When Pippa decided to leave town to live with her new boyfriend Ian Routledge, Sally assumed she would let her and Tim move into the house. She was angry when instead she asked Travis and Rebecca Nash to move in so they could look after the other foster children, seeing it as Pippa putting the needs of those who hadn't been there as long before hers. However, she and Tim weren't to last much longer; he became insanely jealous, quizzing both her and Sam about her past boyfriends. When he saw her hugging Travis, he began spreading stories that Travis liked young girls. It was enough to break up him and Sally and see him run out of town. With Pippa gone and Sally now at uni and not much younger than Travis and Rebecca, she found herself considered one of the adults of the house. Uncomfortable with the responsibility, she moved in with Vinnie Patterson and Jesse McGregor. She then started dating Sean Ellis, a much older man who had a daughter, Daria, who was not much younger than Sally (and dating Sam, her foster brother). Sally managed to win over Daria by sticking up for her when her mother Tanya neglected her but by then she and Sean were virtually over, since he had slept with Tanya during her brief visit. Around the same time, Sally was accidentally shot by a drifter named Murray during an armed robbery at the Diner but suffered only minor injuries. Sally and Vinnie were astonished when they found themselves developing feelings for each other and started dating. However, although they softened each other's hard edges a bit, they were ultimately too different and split. Sally goes to Ireland and returns with fianc, Kieran Fletcher. She moves in with Shauna Bradley (Kylie Watson) and Leah Poulos (Ada Nicodemou). At her wedding Gypsy Nash (Kimberley Cooper) announces Kieran has been making advances towards her. Sally blames Gypsy but sees sense. Upset Sally starts suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder. Kieran's best man, Luke Harvey, arrives to help Sally through her troubles. The pair soon develop feelings for each other and become engaged. Sally abandons her plans to become an archaeologist and decides to become a teacher. Principal Judith Ackroyd (Anna Hruby) appoints Sally as Summer Bay High's new history teacher. Sally and Luke become distant due to work. Harry Reynolds (Justin Melvey) kisses her and she realises she has to call the wedding off. She starts dating colleague Brett Egan (Emmanuel Marshall), however she reports him for assaulting Noah Lawson (Beau Brady) and he leaves her. She and Gypsy become good friends. Flynn Saunders (Martin Dingle-Wall) starts working at the Drop-In Centre, he and Sally start a romance.
