Jessica Fisher is an American poet, and was the winner of the Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition in 2007. She is the daughter of Ann Fisher-Wirth.[1] She is a post-doctoral fellow at the University of California at Berkeley.[2][3] Her poems have appeared in The Believer,[4] The Colorado Review, The New Yorker, The Three Penny Review, and TriQuarterly. She has appeared at LitQuake, San Francisco,[5] and the Berkeley Poetry Review. She lives in Oakland with her husband, daughter and son. Louise Glck's fourth pick as judge of the prestigious Yale Series of Younger poets prize is a debut filled with dark, ethereal verses and prose poems.[6] Another point which begs to be made is that certain types of poems/manuscripts seem to be championed in this circumstance: poems that are safe but pretty, tense but disclosed, risqu but not truly subversive. Welcome to Jessica Fishers Frail-Craft, a book that balances the dominant and egocentric I with the more universal and heavily praised collective identity. This book is full of what feel like genuine experiences and emotions coupled with sometimes interesting but mostly tired and intrusive insights.[7] Like Carson, Fisher imprints a saturated pattern of reddish blips on the readers mind. In fact, the last lines of the red-tinted section of Stereography could describe the readers collective response to engaging Fishers dense palette of words: but for a long time we watched their hot color flashing [8]
