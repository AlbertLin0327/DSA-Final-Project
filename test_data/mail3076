Templemore (Irish: An Teampall Mr, meaning "The Big Church") is a town in North Tipperary, Ireland. It is a civil parish in the historical barony of Eliogarty. It is part of the Roman Catholic parish of Templemore, Clonmore and Killea.[1] The 2011 Census results show the towns population decreased by 13.8% from 2,255 in 2006 to 1,943 in 2011. Templemore is the fourth largest town in North Tipperary. It is located in the mid-east of North Tipperary. The main artery of the town is the N62 National route which originates in the centre of Ireland at Athlone and terminates at the main Dublin-Cork motorway (the M8). In between it connects the town with Roscrea to the north and with Thurles to the south. To the east, the R433 connects the town to the M8 / N8 at a more northerly point via the villages of Clonmore & Errill and the town of Rathdowney. Alternatively, the motorway may be accessed via the village of Templetouhy. To the west, the R501, tracking the Devil's Bit mountain range, goes to Borrisoleigh. Templemore is on the Dublin-Cork railway line operated by Iarnrd ireann. There are direct trains to and from stations like Dublin (8 trains avg), Thurles (9 trains avg) Cork(7 trains avg) daily. The ancient territory of ile obtained its name from pre-historic inhabitants called the Eli, about whom little is known beyond what may be gathered from legends and traditions. The extent of ile varied throughout the centuries with the rise and fall of the tribes in occupation. Before the 5th century A.D. the details of its history which can be gleaned from surviving records and literature are exceedingly meagre, obscure and confusing. During this century however ile appears to have reached its greatest extent, stretching from Croghan Bri Eli (Croghan Hill in Offaly) to just south of Cashel (in Corca Eathrach Eli). The southern part of this territory embraced the baronies of Eliogarty and Ikerrin, a great part of the modern barony of Middle Third, the territory of Ileagh and a portion of the present barony of Kilnamanagh Upper. By the 8th century, the territory of Ancient ile had broken up into a number of petty kingdoms: the OCarroll occupied the northern portion, the OSpillanes held Ileagh, the Eganacht Chaisil had annexed Middle Third. The ancient name of the district on which the town now stands was 'Tuatha Corca Teine.' Teine was supposed to have been the son of the King of Connacht, arriving in the district shortly after St Patrick. Monastic settlements were located at the site of Teine's fort, Land of the Monks (Irish: Farran na Manna). A holy man named Silean is reputed to have accompanied St Patrick and to have established a monastery in the area. There is no townland called Templemore. The townland on which the town is built is Kiltillane (Irish: Cill tSilean), meaning Saint Sheelan's Church. With the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169, a powerful Norman family - the Butlers - became the new overlords. Early in the 14th century, they were raised to the Earldom of Ormond. As the holders of the County Palatine of Tipperary, they were entitled to appoint sheriffs, judges and to certain classes of revenue that would normally have been due to the Crown. This privilege was withdrawn in 1715. The family donated a small piece of land to the Abbey of St Thomas in Dublin, and about 1200 a large Abbey was built with a moated graveyard, the remains of which are still to be seen in Templemore Demesne, commonly known as the "Town Park". The Blackcastle, as it is locally known, was built in the Town Park in 1450 by James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond.[2] This building and its manor lands were occupied by the Butlers and were later leased to the families of Purcell of Loughmore (Loughmoe) and Morris of Knocka.[3] The OFogarty clan held what is now the barony of Eliogarty, while to the north of them, at least some time later, were OMeaghers of Ikerrin.[4] The River Nore, at its position between Roscrea and Templemore, although just a small stream at this point, is usually taken as the southern limit of Ely O'Carroll territory. Around 1695 the Butlers sold extensive lands to an English family called Carden[5] from Cheshire, who settled in the area and also located at Barnane and Fishmoyne. Over the next 200 years, this family was to play a significant part in the history of Templemore and district. Following the burning of the Blackcastle, Carden built a new estate. He built a mansion known as the Priory on the edge of the town. The architecture of the Priory was in the style of the Elizabethan era. The Priory was surrounded by a demesne which had a formal garden with paved paths around an artificial lake. Quoting from a contemporary newspaper commentary of 1861, when the Priory was still under construction: The noble Gothic pile of finely chiselled limestone, with its battlements, turrets, buttresses and extensive faade, and spacious arched doorway; the architraves of grouped columns, retreating to the depth of several feet, convey to the mind an idea of architectural grandeur seldom associated with the country residences of our gentry. There were extensive gardens and a lot of money was spent on them: The house itself consists of sixty rooms, and the sum of, we understand 20,000 in round numbers, has been expended so far upon the building, - Upon entering the grand hall, through the massive oaken doorway, replete with medieval decorations, the visitor finds that The Priory has been erected in a style of magnificence not very generally met with  it is floored en mosaique, in walnut and oak; the peculiar grotesque spirit of the Gothic style is not permitted to run riot through the rich oak carving, while that more beautiful element, tracery enters largely into the interior ornamentation  the oak painted ceiling richly stuccoed and the polished armour shields an banners that hang around with the erect figures in full suits of armour; the wide staircase in massive oak  the great doorways leading to the drawing room at one side and to the library at the other  the rich and mellow light that comes through the beautiful stained glass window that forms the upper portion of the Gothic entrance, and through the lancet shaped sashes  all this bespeak a profuse liberality and taste of order. [6] The Cardens also kept the ruins of the old church and graveyard, but merely as conversational pieces, which was typical of that time. At the entrance on the Borrisoleigh Road is the gate keeper's lodge. After 1860, the Priory was renamed the Abbey.[7] Lewis' directory of 1837 lists the principal landowners in the locality at the time: " Lloydsborough is the seat of J. Lloyd, Esq.; part of the demesne is in Killea, though the mansion is in the parish of Templemore; it is a handsome residence in a well-planted demesne. The other principal seats are Woodville Lodge, the residence of D. J. Webb, Esq.; Belleville, of the Hon. C. J. K. Monck; and Eastwood, of T. Bennett, Esq.".[8] Originally called "Richmond barracks", the 17-acre (69,000 m2) site was donated by the town's founder and largest landowner, Sir John Carden (second baronet, Templemore) who also donated the adjoining 40 acres (160,000 m2) for training and recreation. The barracks consisted of 2 squares, surrounded by company lines, stores, married quarters, officer's mess, military prison, church and hospital. Completely surrounded by a high wall, with protective/defensive posts at each corner, it had accommodation for 25 officers, married quarters for 48 other ranks, and 767 unmarried personnel. A total of 36 hospital beds and 15 guardroom cells were located within the complex as well as stabling for 27 officers horses. The surrounding area was quickly developed, with names such as Talavera Place, Vimeiro Mall and Regent Bridge,[9] a reminder to all of the victories of the British in the Peninsular War taking place at the time of the construction of the barracks.[10] Since February 1964, the barracks has been the site of the Garda Sochna College, the centre for training Ireland's police force.[11] In August 1920, buildings in Templemore were burned down by Crown Forces or Black and Tans in reprisal for the killing of District Inspector Wilson of the Royal Irish Constabulary. The reprisals were brought to a sudden end by the occurrence of the so-called Templemore miracles: a number of holy statues in the locality purportedly began to bleed spontaneously. This caused Templemore to become a pilgrim town for a short time. Dan Breen - a famous Tipperary IRA freedom fighter, and later a Fianna Fil TD for Tipperary - said he always knew these 'miracles' to have been a nonsense but they did attract many sincere pilgrims at the time. Another IRA ambush nearby the following month caused the pilgrims to make a hasty exit and normal (war-time) conditions prevailed in Templemore once more.[12] There are 38 townlands in the civil parish of Templemore.[13] The bulk of the town of Templemore lies in the townland of Kiltillane which has the River Suir as its eastern boundary. Townlands in the north-western parts of the parish are situated in the barony of Ikerrin. From north to south they are Killough, Clontaaffe, Craiguedarg, Curraduff and Graiguebeg. This can be readily verified from the O.S.I.'s historical map of the barony. The townland of Killawardy is mainly in the civil parish of Killea. Adjacent to it, but in the parish of Templemore and the barony of Eliogarty, is a townland of the same name. The most notable landmark in the district is the Devil's Bit mountain range. It is a popular excursion for people to visit the Rock and cross at the summit. Following the War of Independence, the private demesne of the Carden family came into the ownership of the town's urban district council which handed it over to the citizens as the Town Park. The Park incorporates an outdoor Swimming Pool, GAA grounds (Pirc Shlein), Lakeside Pitch & Putt Course and an all-weather athletic track in the care of Templemore Athletic Club. The demesne's mature woodlands features walks, the romantic ruin of the Black Castle on the western bank of the lake and the ruin of the eponymous big church. The main focus of attention is the man-made lake (7.5acres) which is suitable for coarse fishing. On the Roscrea road there is a cluster of buildings associated with the Church of Ireland community. The most significant of these is St. Mary's Church which is the principal church serving the Church of Ireland community in Templemore, Thurles and Kilfithmone.[14] The church originally stood in front of one of the entrances to the Abbey's parkland. When the estates locally known as The Park were built in the late 1950s, the entrance gates and avenue were removed by the town council. The church, along with St Marys School, the Rectory, adjacent cottage and lodge, were built in 1789 on land donated by Sir John Craven Carden. It was solemnly consecrated by the Archbishop of Cashel, His Grace, Charles Agar in 1794. The clock tower is now restored and is floodlit as part of a millennium project. At the nearby village of Loughmore is the historic Loughmoe Castle. The local area is quite scenic and there are expansive views from the Devil's Bit mountain close by. The market square with its Town Hall in the centre of the town is reputed locally to be the widest in either Ireland or Britain. It backs on to an extensive wooded Town Park and lake. The Georgian architecture (dating from 19th century) with its three storey houses on the main street, was directed by Sir John Carden (2nd Baronet, Templemore). There is a large cattle mart on Bank Street which opens on Thursdays. In addition the town has a number of small industries. Under the provisions of the Local Government Act 2001,[15] the former Urban District Council was renamed the Town Council. The members of the Town Council as at 2010[16] are: The local Gaelic Athletic Association club, J.K. Brackens GAA, formed in 1991 when clubs from Clonmore, Killea and Templemore merged. It is named after Joseph Kevin Bracken, one of the founders of the GAA,[17] who came from Templemore. His son, Brendan Bracken, 1st Viscount Bracken was a member of Winston Churchill's government in the United Kingdom during World War II, was born in Templemore.[18] The other WWII connection is that of William Joyce (a.k.a. Lord Haw-Haw). According to local lore, he lived off the Main Street during the War of Independence and was run out of the town by the old IRA for informing on their activities to crown forces. The local soccer/association football club is Blackcastle United FC. The club is named after the Black Castle which is located in Templemore Town Park. There is a nine hole golf course located at close to the Garda Sochna College just off the Thurles road. Lakeside Pitch-and-Putt club is located beside the lake in the Town Park. It is affiliated to the Pitch and Putt Union of Ireland. Coarse fishing is available in the lake in the town park. Tenders have been submitted for the "Templemore Lake Restoration and Management Study" (30/10/2009) due to concerns about the rising levels of phosphates in the lake's sediments.[19] Templemore is twinned with the village of Prmilhat in France and Potenza Picena in Italy.[20]
