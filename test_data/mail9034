Keith Price (born c. 1991) is an American football quarterback. He is currently the starting quarterback for the 2011 Washington Huskies football team. Price grew up in Compton, California, and attended St. John Bosco High School in Bellflower, California. As a senior at St. John Bosco, he completed 143 of 200 passes for 2,260 yards and 24 touchdowns, while also rushing for 579 yards and 10 touchdowns.[1] Price's performance in high school was overshadowed by Matt Barkley who became the Gatorade National Football Player of the Year while playing for Bosco rival Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, California.[2] Price was co-MVP of the Trinity League. In July 2008, Price announced that he had accepted a football scholarship to attend the University of Washington.[3] After serving on the scout team while redshirting in 2009, Price became the Huskies' backup quarterback in 2010. He appeared in eight games and was the starting quarterback against the No. 1 ranked Oregon Ducks. He completed 14 of 28 passes against Oregon for 127 yards, no interceptions, and a touchdown.[4] He also replaced Jake Locker against USC, and threw a touchdown pass on his first play in the game.[1] Price became Washington's starting quarterback as a redshirt sophomore in 2011.[5] In the second game of the season, he completed 18 of 25 passes for 315 yards and four touchdowns in a 40-32 victory over Hawaii. The following week, he threw for 271 yards and four touchdowns against the Nebraska Cornhuskers.[6] During the 2011 regular season, Price completed 219 of 325 passes for 2,625 yards and 29 touchdowns.[6] His 161.9 quarterback rating ranked 13th among all NCAA Division I FBS players, and his 29 touchdown passes ranked seventh.[7][8] Despite posting impressive statistics, Price had not garnered the nationwide media attention received by other leading quarterbacks.[9][10][11] Price acknowledged feeling ignored but added, "I kind of like flying under the radar."[2] In the Alamo Bowl that season against the Baylor Bears, Price threw for over 400 yards, four touchdown passes and three touchdown runs. Due to a poor defense, Washington lost 67-56. Price then began receiving a lot more attention as possibly a future Heisman trophy candidate. In 2011 as more attention grew for potential future Heisman candidacy, he was given the nick name "Teeth" Price for his award winning smile in all his interviews.
