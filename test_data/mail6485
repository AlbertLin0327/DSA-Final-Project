Solomon Gold are a publicly traded company listed on the Alternative Investment Market, which is part of the London Stock Exchange. Their core focus "is to discover a world class copper and gold mine on the south west Pacific Rim of Fire, in the shadow of some of the worlds largest gold mines." [3] In June 2010, Solomon Gold's CEO Nicholas Mather spoke at the 69th Minesite Mining Forum in London, England.[4] Solomon Gold currently have expanding projects in many areas of the Solomon Islands, including Sutakiki, Mbetilonga, Koloula, Central Guadalcanal and Fauro Island. They have also acquired projects in Queensland, Australia, including Mount Perry, Rannes and Normanby; most of which are run by their subsidiaries.[5][6] In December 2009, Solomon Gold announced that they had acquired 100% of the share capital in Acapulco Mining Pty Ltd, giving them access to several projects in Queensland, Australia.[7] It was then announced in July 2009 that Solomon Gold had raised 1.6 million ($19m SBD) to fund additional drilling at the Rannes and Mount Perry projects. The money was raised through the issuing of 33.1 million shares, which were sold to private and institutional investors. Solomon Gold's directors collectively bought 7.5 million shares.[8] On September 23, 2010, in what raised Solomon Gold's share price by almost 300%[9], they announced that 157 samples from their project on the Fauro Island had returned 97.6grams per Tonne (g/t) gold, and 90.1g/t silver. The news also gave D'Aguilar Gold huge gains, a company who trade on the Australian Securities Exchange and own 35.2 million shares in Solomon Gold.[10]
