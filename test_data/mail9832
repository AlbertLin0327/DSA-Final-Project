The Brew-Hatcher or B & H was an American automobile introduced in January 1904 at the Chicago Automobile Show and manufactured from 1904 until 1905. Around 1903 William A. Hatcher, one of the founders of and engineers for the Ohio Automobile Company (which in later became known as the Packard Motor Car Company) and Francis O. Brew started a component supply company. They launched their first automobile, built from many of their company's components, in January 1904. 1903 Model: A five-passenger, 16hp tourer, it hailed from Cleveland, Ohio. 16hp horizontally-opposed twin engine and rear-entrance tonneau body. 1905 Model: The same model was offered, but on a longer wheelbase, which allowed for a side-entrance tonneau, and there was also an 18/24hp 4-cylinder tourer. Car manufacture ended in Fall 1905 when Brew retired to join the Internal Revenue Service. David Burgess Wise, The New Illustrated Encyclopedia of Automobiles. G. N.
