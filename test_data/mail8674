Dionne's education included studies at Rimouski Seminary and Universit Laval.[1] He was first elected to Parliament at the Matane riding in the 1925 general election then re-elected there in 1926. After completing his second term, the 16th Canadian Parliament, Dionne was defeated by Henri LaRue of the Conservatives.
