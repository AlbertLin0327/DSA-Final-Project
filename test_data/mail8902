Some view Jade use in Mesoamerica as largely influenced by the conceptualization of the material as a rare and valued commodity among pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures, such as the Olmec, the Maya, and the various groups in the Valley of Mexico. Until the 21st century it was thought the only source from which the indigenous cultures could obtain jade was the Motagua River valley in Guatemala. In addition to being an elite good of highly symbolic use in the performance of ideological ritual the high pressure minerals that form the translucent rocks termed jades are much tougher and more damage resistant than slightly harder but far mor brittle materials such as flint. This extreme durability makes fine grained or fibrous jadeite and nephrite in effect the 'steel' of neolithic technology. It was often worked or carved in a variety of ways, either as ornamental stones, a medium upon which hieroglyphs were inscribed, or shaped into figurines, weapons, and other objects. Many jade artifacts crafted by later Mesoamerican civilizations, appear cut from simple jade axes, implying that the earliest trade had a utilitarian component. The general term jade refers to two separate rock types. The first is called nephrite, a calcium and magnesium rich amphibole mineral. Nephrite does not exist in Mesoamerica. The second is jadeitite, a pyroxene rich in sodium and aluminum. Variation in color is largely due to variation in trace element composition. In other words, the types of trace elements and their quantities affect the overall color of the material. The Olmec Blue jade owes its unique color to the presence of iron and titanium, while the more typical green jades color is due to the varying presence of sodium, aluminum, iron, and chromium. Translucence can vary as well, with specimens ranging form nearly clear to completely opaque. Among Mesoamerican archaeologists, "jade" is sometimes used in a manner that does not differentiate between jadeite and other similar-looking, relatively hard greenstones such as albitite, omphacite, chrysoprase, and quartzite.[1] The archaeological search for the Mesoamerican jade sources, which were largely lost at the time of the Maya collapse, began in 1799 when Alexander von Humboldt started his geological research in the New World. Von Humboldt sought to determine whether or not Neolithic jadeite celts excavated from European Megalithic archaeological sites like Stonehenge and Carnac shared sources with the similar looking jade celts from Mesoamerica (they do not). From 1954 to 1996 the only documented source of jadeite in Mesoamerica was the lowland Motagua River valley. Research conducted by the Mesoamerican Jade Project of Harvard's Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology between 1977 and 2000 led to the identification of both the long lost 'Olmec Blue" mines, a discovery published by Mesoamerican Jade project Field Director Russell Seitz and his colleagues from the American Museum of Natural History in Antiquity in December 2001. They in addition conducted geochemical dating of several ancient Maya lode mines and alluvial sources in the mountainous areas on both sides of the Motagua. Following their exposure by the torrential rains of Hurricane Mitch in 1998, alluvial cobbles of blue jade were traced up a southern Motagua tributary, the Rio Tambor, to massive outcrops of fine grained translucent ' Olmec Blue' jadeite, at elevations of between 1200 and 3800 feet in the province of Jalapa, along a fault extending from Carrizal Grande to La Ceiba. Geochemical dating revealed that the southern deposits, including the archaeologically important translucent blue jade, were ~ 40 MA older that the coarse grained opaque jades mined for sale to tourists, or those from the higher elevations around a northern Motagua tributary, the Rio Blanco, where jadeite outcrops are found at elevations of up to an elevation of 6,000 feet) and several of the ancient mining sites are connected by dry-laid stone paths. It is noteworthy that the richest 'Olmec Blue' source area, far from being in 'the Motagua Valley' lies about 50km southwest of Copan. Since the Motagua becomes Guatemala's border with Honduras, Honduras may host alluvial jade as well. The rediscovered 'Olmec' jade is of the quality traded throughout formative Mesoamerica, reaching areas as distant as the Valley of Mexico and Costa Rica. While Pool notes that "for many years, it had been suggested that there might be another source in the Balsas River valley", p.151 no such Mexican source has come to light;</ref> However, recent work has revealed that the high pressure-low temperature metamorphic rocks ( blueschist facies) hosting jade deposits in Guatemala also outcrop as jadeite boulder bearing serpentine melange deposits at several places in Cuba and Hispaniola, where the material was exploited by the Taino and Carib cultures. Jade artifacts, mainly pointed celts, apparently stemming from these Antillean sources have been excavated as far east as Antigua in the Windward Islands. Given the scope and duration of the regional tectonic processes that created and exhumed these jade deposits, they may well extend into Chiapas as well. Jade was shaped into a variety of objects including, but not limited to, figurines, celts, ear spools (circular earrings with a large hole in the center), and teeth inlays (small decorative pieces inserted into the incisors). Mosaic pieces of various sizes were used to decorate belts and pectoral coverings. Jade sculpture often depicted deities, people, shamanic transformations, animals and plants, and various abstract forms. Sculptures varied in size from single beads, used for jewelry and other decorations, to large carvings, such as the 4.42 kilogram head of the Maya sun god found at Altun Ha. Jade workshop areas have been documented at two Classic Maya sites in Guatemala: Cancuen and Guaytan. The archaeological investigation of these workshops has informed researchers on how jadeite was worked in ancient Mesoamerica. Jade was used extensively in warfare by the Maya in particular. As the Maya had limited metallurgy skill and could only cast gold, and copper in small quantities, the use of metals as armor was not feasible for the Maya. In place of metal armor Maya soldiers would wear pieces of carved jade or jadeite over sensitive or vulnerable areas such as the chest, head, face and shoulders. It is believed the Olmec also used jade as armor in this fashion. Jade facial, pectoral, arm, and shoulder armor have been found at the burial sites of Maya nobility and soldiers. Jade may have also been used as a type of armoring on the ornate helmet-like wood and leather combat headdresses used by Maya warriors. These headdresses typically contained a wood frame with pieces of shaped jade covering areas susceptible to injury such as the temples and forehead. In addition to armor, the Maya made heavy use of jade weapons. The most common types of jade weapons the Mayan utilized were daggers, blades and axes carved from single pieces of jade. These weapons were typically serrated or carved to a knife like sharpness. Many of the jade weapons were mounted on wood handles or much more rarely copper or gold mounts. The value of jade went beyond its material worth. Perhaps because of its color, mirroring that of water and vegetation, it was symbolically associated with life and death and therefore possessed high religious and spiritual importance. The Maya placed jade beads in the mouth of the dead. Michael D. Coe has suggested that this practice relates to a sixteenth century funerary ritual performed at the deaths of Pokom Maya lords: "When it appears then that some lord is dying, they had ready a precious stone which they placed at his mouth when he appeared to expire, in which they believe that they took the spirit, and on expiring, they very lightly rubbed his face with it. It takes the breath, soul or spirit." The Maya also associated jade with the sun[2] and the wind.[citation needed] Many Maya jade sculptures and figurines of the wind god have been discovered, as well as many others displaying breath and wind symbols. In addition, caches of four jade objects placed around a central element which have been found are believed to represent not only the cardinal directions, but the directional winds as well. The aesthetic and religious significance of the various colors remains a source of controversy and speculation. The bright green varieties may have been identified with the young Maize God. The Olmec were fascinated with the unique blue jade of Guatemala and it played an important role in their rituals involving water sources. The Olmec used blue jade because it represented water, an Olmec iconography representing the Underworld. Blue also represented the blue color that snakes turn before shedding their skin; therefore, blue represents aquatic and serpentine rejuvenation. Next to emery, jade was the hardest mineral known to ancient Mesoamerica.[3] In the absence of metal tools, ancient craftsmen used tools themselves made of jade, leather strops, string saws to cut and carve jade, and reeds or other hard materials to drill holes. (Mesoamerican artisans also used jade tools to work other stones.) It would take many hours of work to create even a single jade bead.[4]
