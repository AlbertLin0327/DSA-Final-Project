Sean Dempsey is a former manager of the Laois Gaelic football team. A former player for the Laois senior football team. Dempsey had enjoyed huge success as an underage team coach and manager and in late 2008 was appointed to succeed Liam Kearns in the top job of Laois football. After two relatively unsuccessful years in the position, he was relieved of the job in July 2010. Dempsey is highly regarded as a manager and coach and during his spell with Laois minors he turned them into one of the top underage teams in Ireland, the highlight being the 2003 All-Ireland Minor Football Championship title. He managed the Laois under 21 side to successive Leinster titles in 2006 and 2007 and to an All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship final appearance in 2007, where they were cruelly denied by Cork. As a player, Sean was a member of the St Josephs club winning a number of Laois Senior Football Championship titles with them. After a successful minor football career, he graduated to become a member of the Laois Under 21 and senior football panels, playing alongside his brothers Martin and Mick for many years. 1 C.
