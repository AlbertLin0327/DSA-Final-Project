"Anotherloverholenyohead" is a 1986 song by Prince and The Revolution, from the album Parade, the soundtrack to the film Under the Cherry Moon.[1] The song is essentially a solo performance by Prince, but with backing vocals from Susannah Melvoin, and the horn section of Eric Leeds and Atlanta Bliss. The song also features a string arrangement by Clare Fischer. The song is set in a minor key, and written around a piano chord sequence, although the arrangement emphasizes an upfront guitar synth and a drum machine. The lyrics are about a man trying to reclaim a lover who is intent on leaving him for another. The song's title is a combination of the main idea of the song, and the chorus, which says "U need another lover like u need a hole in yo head". The single received a 12" extended release with intricate piano work and some dance commands from Prince. The B-side was the LP version of "Girls & Boys" in the U.S., but since that was already released as a single on its own in the UK, the B-side there was "I Wanna Be Your Lover", from 1979's Prince. Despite a large amount of publicity provided by its predecessors and the film Under the Cherry Moon, the single stalled on the charts in both the UK and the U.S.
