Frank, of the entertainment production company Prospect Park. He has worked with many celebrities,[1] including music acts Backstreet Boys, Jennifer Lopez and Kelly Clarkson and actors Samuel L. Jackson and Vin Diesel. Jeff Kwatinetz founded the company in 1997 to quickly become one of the top management and production companies in the industry representing talent in all facets of entertainment.[2] He has been successful in breaking, developing and managing the careers of artists such as KoRn, Limp Bizkit, Backstreet Boys, Snoop Dogg, Enrique Iglesias, Vin Diesel, Ice Cube, Jennifer Lopez, Kelly Clarkson, OneRepublic, Rachel Weisz, michael jackson, Audioslave, Pete Yorn, Puddle of Mudd, and many more. The Firm acquired Artist Management Group in 2002 to add high-profile television and film industry managers and clients such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Kate Hudson, Benicio del Toro, Bill Condon and Martin Scorsese and expand into an all-encompassing entertainment management and production company. Today Kwatinetz serves as CEO of Prospect Park, a media and production company with a portfolio of high-profile entertainment clients and film and television production under its banner. Jeff founded Prospect Park in 2009 after several years operating as the CEO of The Firm. With Prospect Park, Jeff serves as executive producer of the recently debuted hit F/X comedy Wilfred, and USA Networks high rated medical comedy, Royal Pains. The company additionally has several films and television programs in development and manages the careers of artists and talent across film, music and television The Firm survived a massive exodus of execs and clients back in 2005 when, JoAnne Colonna, a manager of the company's film talent department, left with her clients that includes Anna Paquin, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Brittany Murphy (Kwatinetz's one-time fiance), and Brendan Fraser. Only weeks before, her co-manager, Aleen Keshishian, had also left with clients Natalie Portman, Orlando Bloom, Laura Linney and Freddie Prinze Jr. And those moves followed the departures of the co-managers of the music department when Simon Renshaw took with him the Dixie Chicks, Clay Aiken and Anastacia, and Andy Gould left with Rob Zombie. Kwatinetz has been a controversial figure in the industry especially in connection with such clients as Britney Spears. On September 17, 2007 he released the following statement: "It saddens us to confirm media reports that we have terminated our professional relationship with Britney Spears. We have represented Britney for the past month. We believe Britney is enormously talented, and has made a terrific record. But current circumstances have prevented us from properly doing our job. We wish Britney the best."[3] Kwatinetz left The Firm in late 2008. He's expected to start his own music, film and television management firm and film and TV production company. [1] Jeff has now started his new Management/Record company Prospect Park, and recently signed a deal with Vancouver/LA based band, Like a Storm. Other clients include the Backstreet Boys and Korn.
