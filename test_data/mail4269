Takhti Stadium (Persian:  ) is a multi-purpose stadium in Tehran, Iran. It is used mostly for football matches. The stadium is able to hold 30,000 people and was opened in 1973. But, in recent years the stadium has been abandoned and there is no grass field. In 2011 a Russian organization showed interest in bringing Takhti Stadium back to life.
