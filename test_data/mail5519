John Henderson (1605-1650), 5th of Fordell was born 3 November 1605[1] in Fordel, Fife[2] He was a distinguished soldier, taken prisoner when commanding at the African Coast,[2] ransomed, and later fought on the side of the Royalists in the Civil War when Henderson was invested as a Knight by King Charles I. Henderson assisted Sir John Digby, the High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, to seize Newark on behalf of Charles I in late 1642[3] The Earl of Newcastle then made him Governor of Newark.[4] During his time in Newark, Henderson lived and worked in The Governor's House[5] In February 1643, Henderson led a sortie from the town that successfully repulsed Major-General Thomas Ballard's force of 6,000 Parliamentarians.[6] This led to suspicions that Ballard had colluded with the Royalists. In March 1643, a large force of Royalists from Newark commanded by Sir Charles Cavendish and Henderson marched into Lincolnshire and captured the town of Grantham in a surprise attack.[6] On 9 October 1643 the Eastern Association army (under the command of the Earl of Manchester, Oliver Cromwell and Sir Thomas Fairfax) marched from Boston to Bolingbroke Castle. Sir William Widdrington put together a scratch force, which included Henderson's Royalist cavalry, in an attempt to relieve the castle. Two days later, the Earl of Manchester routed Henderson's Royalist cavalry at the Battle of Winceby.[4] By the end of October 1645 Henderson's liaisons between Charles I and the King of Denmark were known to Parliament[7] as Charles became increasingly desperate in his attempt to obtain aid.[8] After "his health and means had been exhausted by his long imprisonment" he was allowed to retire to Denmark[2]. Sources agree that he died on the 11 March 1650, but differ over the place (Denmark[2] or Fife[9]). His parents were Sir John Henderson, 4th of Fordell and Agnes Balfour.[10] He married Margaret Menteith, daughter of William Menteith of Randiford, on 7 February 1625.[9] and together they raised ten children:
