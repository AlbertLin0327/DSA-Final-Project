Ghost Hunters Academy (abbreviated as GHA) is a paranormal reality television series that premiered on November 11, 2009 on the Syfy channel. The program is the third spin-off series based on Ghost Hunters (after Ghost Hunters International and UFO Hunters). The show features TAPS members Steve Gonsalves and Dave Tango as they lead a group of prospective investigators on various ghost hunting cases at locations that are allegedly haunted, and which had been previously investigated by TAPS.[1] The tagline of the show is: "Get schooled...in the paranormal." *Allowed to continue training in season 1.5, but did not return.      Note: Although GHA was an elimination competition, no one was dismissed during episodes 1, 2 and 4. Jane Riley was brought in episode 3 where Heathyr Hoffman was the first to be eliminated. In episode 5, Chris McCune quit the competition on his own. Jane Riley was dismissed episode 6. Chris Smith (who was brought in episode 5) and Ben Smith (who was in all the first six episodes), were both invited back to continue training for season 1.5, but they did not return. Instead, eight new cadets were brought in for season 1.5 and a regular cadet elimination process was held each episode from then on.
