Infrared Integrated Systems Ltd, generally called Irisys, is a privately-held company based near Northampton in the United Kingdom. It is a global leader in thermal imaging, people counting technologies and real time queue management solutions. Irisys infrared arrays are used by many of the worlds leading retailers, banks, transport hubs and leisure facilities to improve customer service, operational efficiency and profitability. Irisys exports some 80 per cent of its products. In 2011, the company was awarded The Queens Award for Enterprise[1], the highest official award for British businesses. Irisys was selected in the International Trade category because of its outstanding performance in exports. Irisys is regularly featured in the Sunday Times Tech Track list of Britains fastest growing technology companies. The company invests 10 percent or more of its revenues in research and development and holds over 70 patents. One in six employees has a PhD. Irisys was founded in 1996 by a small group of scientists and engineers, who had previously worked at the Plessey Caswell research labs, predominantly on high-resolution military infrared imaging systems. Irisys originally aimed to adapt the technology to the requirements of the commercial fire and security markets. Military detectors typically cost tens of thousands of dollars, but Irisys aimed to produce radically cheaper devices by trading a reduction in resolution for lower manufacturing costs, and so the company decided on a resolution of 256 pixels using a 16 x 16 sensor array. Irisys continues to manufacture a range of low-cost hand-held infrared cameras used in applications such as measuring heat loss from buildings, but quickly realised that the technology behind tracking people for security purposes could also be applied to other sectors. Counting people and queues in retail and other social environments were the first of these new areas to be commercially exploited by Irisys, and the company continues to research and develop novel application areas. Irisys applies its technology to five main sectors: In 2004, supermarket giant Tesco was seeking ways to improve customer service, and minimising checkout queue length was a priority. In response, Irisys invented, developed, manufactured and installed the worlds first infrared intelligent queue management system. As of 2011, Irisys has installed similar solutions for major retailers in Europe and, increasingly, North America. The solution developed for Tesco uses ceiling mounted infrared sensors at store entrances and above the checkout lanes, to detect the number and behaviour of customer groups at the checkouts. The sensors use an algorithm to automatically calculate the average queue length, average wait time, and overall store performance against Tescos One in Front customer service commitment. Displaying real-time queuing data on the shop floor enables the retailers management team to deploy its multi-skilled staff to react quickly to potential queuing issues, opening and closing tills to deliver optimal performance, and maximise labour resources. In 2006, Tesco CEO Sir Terry Leahy credited the thermal imaging cameras as being a key factor in the companys half-year pre-tax profits rising ten per cent. Leahy commented, We can monitor and manage the service customers get much more precisely  by customer, by store and by the minute. Thanks to this, a quarter of a million more customers every week dont have to queue.[10] Next generation sophisticated predictive queue systems have now been rolled out to other customers, notably British supermarket Morrisons (400+ stores in the UK). Retailers use Irisys historical reports and ideal lane scheduler to get the optimal number of employees in the store at the right times, and leverage a real time queue predictor to optimise the deployment of available staff around the store to proactively manage queues, and to support other service functions on the shop floor. In the late 1990s the people counting industry was in its infancy, and relied on video and beam-breaking devices. Irisys thermal sensors proved to be much less expensive, more reliable, and more accurate. They negated the privacy concerns associated with video, and were swiftly adopted as the industry standard. Today, Irisys devices are a key component of many people counting solutions globally, counting billions of people a year. Over 100,000 Irisys detectors have been installed in more than 50 countries. Most of these devices are installed in retail stores, shopping centres, and leisure facilities, and are used for performance measurement. Notable users of Irisys people counters include Marks & Spencer, Ikea, Mango, Vodafone, and H&M. Thermal imaging cameras are used in a very wide variety of sectors. In electrical applications, they can identify loose or defective connections, overloaded or fatigued components, and uneven voltage distribution. Mechanically, they can check the condition of bearings, and identify poor motor shaft alignment. For domestic and industrial plumbing and heating, cameras can plot under-floor heating without the need to dig up a large area, identify burst pipes, and check radiators and boilers for efficiency. Irisys thermal image systems are used by military, police, and other government agencies, as well as within commercially sensitive building environments and transport/terminal operations. Detection ranges up to 4km are possible, making them suitable for perimeter monitoring, where they contrast the differential between body heat and that of other objects when viewing in infrared, by night or day. This means that people stand out more noticeably when compared with other CCTV techniques. Night and day video content analysis also becomes more reliable, Irisys maintains. Irisys infrared detectors are also widely used in buildings to provide virtual control points with barrier-less entry, such as for bank branch staff doors; and to monitor one-way doors and corridors to ensure passengers do not move in the wrong direction; as well as to prevent tailgating, where two or more people may attempt to pass through a barrier using a single persons security pass.[11] In 2011, the UKs National Institute for Health Research Invention for Innovation programme awarded Irisys a two year contract to develop sensors to drive improvement in compliance with National Health Service (NHS) hospital hand washing regulations. Together with associated communication and reporting systems, the result will be an automatic and non-intrusive monitoring and alerting system, which will subsequently be applicable to other healthcare providers.[12] Irisys thermal imagers have also been used in airports to prevent the spread of flu. Passengers with these infections typically have higher temperatures than others, and can be spotted automatically as they enter a concourse.[13] Similar technology can measure blood flow to various areas of the body. A new application is non-intrusive home monitoring for the elderly and infirm. The detector array hybrid as manufactured at Irisys comprises the sensing chip, which is created from a thin (typically 200 m thick) pyroelectric ceramic wafer; and an ASIC chip which reads the signal from each array element in a regular scan. The array elements are created by a patterned contact array printed onto the underside of the ceramic chip. The circuit is completed by a continuous contact layer on the upper side of the ceramic, which is transparent to the incoming infrared radiation from the scene. The performance of the detector array depends critically on the geometry, and the ceramic thermal and electrical properties. In particular, the ceramic electrical conductivity is optimized to provide an appropriate shunt resistance at each element, (the required resistance being far too high to provide as on-chip resistors in the ASIC). Thermal design is optimized depending on the thermal targets to be imaged. The pyroelectric responds only to changing thermal targets. If static scenes are to be imaged, (as in hand-held thermal imager applications, for example), the image is chopped with a rotating blade to provide a time-dependent reference. Time constants limit the chopping to 10 Hz, and typical operation is at 8 Hz. For very low-cost detectors, such mechanical chopping is not preferred, and in this case, (for people counting and monitoring applications for example), the natural movement of the objects in the scene is relied upon to generate the pyroelectric response. This has the substantial advantage that background clutter is automatically removed from the scene to be analyzed, (in contrast to a conventional video scene), and only the moving (people) targets are observed. The Irisys manufacturing strategy is to build its unique IR detector array in-house, and utilise external EMS providers for electronic circuit board fabrication and high level assembly. In 2007, the company opened a dedicated manufacturing facility in Northampton for the production of the IR detector array used in all its products. This facility has increased the array manufacturing capacity from 30k to 250k units per annum.
