Planets is Adema's third album. This was the band's first and only album with Luke Carracioli, who left the band on October 25, 2005, citing "personal differences". The album was released by Earache Records on April 5, 2005. It obtained a peak position of 152 on the Billboard 200 before falling off. The album featured three singles: "Tornado", "Shoot the Arrows", and the self-titled track "Planets"; the single "Planets" was featured in the movie Cry Wolf. Planets is the first Adema album not to feature the Explicit Content sticker on its case. All songs written and composed by Adema, except "The Thing That Should Not Be" written by Hammett, Hetfield, Ulrich. Note: International (European) edition of Planets doesn't contain Bad Triangle, Lift Us Up or The Thing That Should Not Be.
