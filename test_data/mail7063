Bindows is a JavaScript based Software Development Kit (SDK) for writing Rich Internet Applications. Bindows applications are defined by XML documents called ADF's (Application Description File). The framework implementation is entirely client-side, but a JSF server side implementation is marketed by the same vendor[1]. In Thailand, there is an operation system called "Bindows XD" which is not to be confused with this software. It is a fake Windows XP released early 2004 still in use as of 2009. Some highlight features[2] of the Bindows SDK are: It's been claimed that Bindows is probably the leading object-oriented platform for developing Ajax applications.[3] While this might be true for implementations in large enterprises(91 of the Fortune-100 Companies, according to the website[4]), many open-source AJAX frameworks are more widely spread. Bindows is the underlying client technology used in System 9[2][5]
