Princess Nora bint Abdulrahman University (PNU; Arabic:      ) is the first women's university in Saudi Arabia and largest women-only university in the world,[4][5] composed of 32 campuses across the Riyadh region and a new library capable of holding 4.5 million volumes.[3] The university was founded as Riyadh University for Women in 1970. King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz launched the building of the world's largest and most modern women's institution of higher education in a self-contained higher education city. A new campus dedicated May 2011 can accommodate 40,000 students and 12,000 employees. It has a 700 bed teaching hospital[4] and research centers for nanotechnology, information technology and bioscience.[6] The university was founded as Riyadh University for Women in 1970. King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz launched the building of the world's largest and most modern women's institution of higher education in a self-contained higher education city. This vision has become a reality with the opening of the University City for the Princess Noura Bint Abdulrahman University for Women. The University City is expected to be fully functional by 2012. Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques says "Women carry a responsibility that is more than a duty, to maintain the stability of society and contribute to building the economy of the nation, and to represent the community and the nation to the highest standards, outside and inside the country. To be the caring mother, exemplary citizen and productive employee. Outside the nation, to be the ambassador of her country and community, and to represent well her religion, faith and our values." The King named the university after Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman, the sister of King Abdulaziz. Nourah in Arabic means light.[7] Women comprise 58% of Saudi Arabia's college students but only 14% of its labor force; much less than in neighboring Islamic countries. 85% of employed Saudi women work in education, 6% in public health, and 95% in the public sector.[5] Princess Nora bint Abdulrahman University is composed of fifteen colleges and several departments:[8] The PNU campus spreads over 8 million square meters, including a new library which will hold 4.5 million books. There are 800 buildings and ten gates between Riyadh and the university campus. In addition to housing for university staff and students, it features mosques, schools and kindergarten for children, and recreation facilities. It is one of the ten largest universities in the world and the largest university for women.[9] The campus also includes sport facilities that students can use. However, they have not been opened to serve the students.[10] The large campus and community have their own unique transport system. The world's largest Automated People Mover (APM) train system is at the university. APM railway total length is 14km having the rush hour capacity of 7000 passengers/hour. It has 33 trains each having maximum capacity up to 224 passengers and maximum speed of 60km/h. The expansion of the campus was done in a record time of two years supported by 75000 construction workers and latest building machinery and methodologies. The University City is expected to be fully functional by 2012. Thirty-eight of its buildings, totaling a million square meters, have applied for a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building rating. The campus operates a monorail shuttle and electric vehicles, and solar panels power 18% of its air conditioning.[11] The new PNU library has applied for the second highest LEED "Gold" rating, and will bring university holdings to six million volumes.
