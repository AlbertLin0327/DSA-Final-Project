This is a list of NIT bids by school (divided by their current conference affiliation). Schools whose names are listed in the last table are no longer in NCAA Division I Men's Basketball, and can no longer be included in the tournament.The years listed are the last tournament year a school has reached a certain round of the NIT. Note also that some schools have NIT tournament appearances under previous names. For example, UTEP was known as Texas Western when it won its NCAA title in 1966. Teams in bold are active in the 2012 National Invitation Tournament. The lists are updated through the finals of the 2012 National Invitation Tournament.
