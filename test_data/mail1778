Vildagliptin inhibits the inactivation of GLP-1[2][3] and GIP[3] by DPP-4, allowing GLP-1 and GIP to potentiate the secretion of insulin in the beta cells and suppress glucagon release by the alpha cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Vildagliptin has been shown to reduce hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus.[2] Novartis has since withdrawn its intent to submit vildagliptin to the FDA, as of July 2008.[4] The Food and Drug Administration had demanded additional clinical data before it could approve vildagliptin including extra evidence that skin lesions and kidney impairment seen during an early study on animals have not occurred in human trials. While the drug is still not approved for use in the US, it was approved in Feb 2008 by European Medicines Agency for use within the EU[5] and is listed on the Australian PBS with certain restrictions.[6] The EMEA has also approved a new oral treatment released by Novartis, called Eucreas, a combination of vildagliptin and metformin.[7] The DPP-4 enzyme is known to be involved in the suppression of certain malignancies, particularly in limiting the tissue invasion of these tumours. Inhibiting the DPP-4 enzymes may allow some cancers to progress.[8][9] A study of DPP-4 inhibition in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) concluded that "DPPIV functions as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation may contribute to the loss of growth control in NSCLC cells.[10] The risk of cancer suppression with DPP-4 down-regulation applies to all the DPP-4 inhibitors on the market in addition to vildagliptin (sitagliptin and saxagliptin) Vildagliptin synth.png Source: 1-[[(3-Hydroxy-1-adamantyl)amino]acetyl]-2-cyano-(S)-pyrrolidine: A Potent, Selective, and Orally Bioavailable Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV Inhibitor with Antihyperglycemic Properties[11] 2nd generation: Glibenclamide (Glyburide)# M: END anat/phys/devp/horm noco(d)/cong/tumr, sysi/epon proc, drug (A10/H1/H2/H3/H5)
