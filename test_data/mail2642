Heavy ConstruKction is a live album (3CD set), incorporating video footage, by the band King Crimson, released by Discipline Global Mobile records in 2000. The album features recordings from King Crimson's European tour of May to July 2000, taken from DAT recordings of the front-of-house mixing desk. King Crimson's 2000 European tour was conducted to promote the studio album The ConstruKction of Light. The band members at the time of the tour were Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew, Trey Gunn and Pat Mastelotto. Bill Bruford had previously left the group, and Tony Levin was not included in this particular King Crimson project due to prior commitments. The third disc features band improvisations from different shows, which are often spliced together in the same track. The liner notes describe the disc as "a cohesive presentation out of a series of incoherent events". Recorded at the Citt della Musica, Rome, Italy, June 23, 2000 CD1&2 recorded and mixed by George Glossop, and produced by David Singleton and Alex R. Mundy. CD3 recorded by Ken Latchney, and produced and mixed by Pat Mastelotto and Bill Munyon.
