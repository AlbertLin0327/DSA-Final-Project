The Xingu corydoras (Corydoras xinguensis) is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the Corydoradinae sub-family of the Callichthyidae family. It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the upper Xingu River basin in Brazil. It is named for the river in which it is found. In the system of "C-Numbers" developed by the German fishkeeping magazine DATZ to identify undescribed species of Corydoras in the aquarium hobby, this fish had been assigned numbers "C55", "C105", "C106", "C107", and "C108" until these were correctly identified. The fish will grow in length up to 1.5 inches (3.7 centimeters). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.08.0 pH, a water hardness of 225 dGH, and a temperature range of 7279 F (2226C). It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. The Xingu corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.
