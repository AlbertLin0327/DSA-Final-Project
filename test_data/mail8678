St. Peter's Episcopal Church Complex is a historic Episcopal church complex at the junction of Pine and Church Streets in Hobart, Delaware County, New York. The complex includes the church, cemetery, rectory, and carriage house. The church was built about 1801 and is a small frame building, 48 feet by 38 feet, with a stone foundation, clapboard siding, and a gable roof. It features a central projecting square tower surmounted by a wooden balustrade and an octagonal louvered belfry with steeple.[2] It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.[1]
