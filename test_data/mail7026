CIXX-FM is a Canadian radio station, broadcasting at 106.9 FM in London, Ontario. It is licensed as a community-based campus radio station by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), and airs a Rhythmic Top 40 format featuring hip-hop, R&B and dance hits. CIXX-FM broadcasts at an effective radiated power of 3kW from Fanshawe College's "M" building, which effectively covers the City of London and some areas outside the city.[1] The station is operated and programmed by students in Fanshawe College's School of Contemporary Media. Radio-Broadcasting students work in on-air announcing, talk programming, writing, production, engineering, music, marketing, and management. News stories, full interviews, images, and events, and contests are all placed on the stations website. Journalism-Broadcast students operate under the title "XFM News" and provide newscasts for the station. These student's work through 3 different 5-week rotations each semester. They are required to either be a Reporter, Newscaster, or Documentary Producer. On the reporting rotation students are required to attend events and conduct one-on-one interviews to help produce two local stories each day. As a Newscaster each student takes turns broadcasting at the top of the hour mixing local, national, and international stories using Newsroom software. As a Documentary Producer most students produce 3, 4-minute radio features each week.
