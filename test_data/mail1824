Coordinates: 515356N 02346W / 51.899N 0.396W / 51.899; -0.396 Stopsley is a ward (politics) in the north-east of Luton. Originally a hill-top village settlement, most of the urbanised part of the civil parish of Stopsley became part of Luton when the boundaries were extended in 1933, with the rural areas going to Hyde and Streatley. After the Second World War, there was a severe shortage of accommodation and to save both time and money new building materials were employed. Many of the houses built at this time used sheetmetal for the upper parts of the construction, hence the local name for part of Stopsley being 'Tintown'. Many of these houses still stand today, although over the last few years the local council has reclad some of them in brick and pebbledash. The centre of Stopsley is made up of a series of local shops around a village church. From a distance the skyline is dominated by Jansel House, an office block built in 1961 which houses the Luton VAT office over a parade of shops at street level including a Greengrocer, Chemist, Charity Shop. Estate Agent, hairdresser and cafe. One of Luton's two cemeteries, The Vale, is located nearby on the Hitchin Road.

There are two high schools in Stopsley, Stopsley High School and Putteridge High School. Frederick Davis, writing in 1855, believed the name of Stospley to come from Scrobbale, (in Saxon;) Scrapes or Scroppeslie, (in Norman;) Shrubsley, (in English.;) meaning a hill covered with scrobbes, (shrubs or underwood.) Most modern etymologists consider the name to be made up of two elements 'Stopp' and 'ley'. dating between AD 750 and AD 950. The ending comes from the Old English 'leah' meaning a wood or clearing in a wood. 'Stopp' was a personal name and indicated ownership of the wood or clearing.

The ward forms part of the parliamentary constituency of Luton South, and the MP is Gavin Shuker (Labour). Stopsley is situated within the East of England (European Parliament constituency).
