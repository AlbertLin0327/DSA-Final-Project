Nepal Dalit Sangh (Nepali:   ) is a Nepalese Dalit movement linked to the Nepali Congress. When the Nepali Congress was divided and the Nepali Congress (Democratic) was formed, a splinter Nepal Dalit Sangh (Prajatantrik) was formed as the NC(D) Dalit wing.[1] With the reunification of NC and NC(D) the NDS and NDS(P) were also reunified, and in August 2007 the Nepali Congress appointed a 39-member ad hoc committee of NDS, with Khadga Bahadur Basyal (Sarki) as president and Jeevan Pariyar as general secretary.[2]
