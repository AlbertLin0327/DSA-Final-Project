Hal Alexander Linton, (born December 25, 1986) is a Barbadian born Soul/R&B singer, songwriter and producer. In October 2008 news broke in the small Caribbean island of Barbados that Hal Linton inked a million dollar deal with major record label Universal Motown, following in the footsteps of other Barbadian international recording artist Rihanna (Def Jam Recordings), Shontelle (Universal Motown), Livvi Franc (Jive Records) and Rupee (Atlantic). Since then, Hal Linton has been working on the production of his debut album "Return from the Future" with the SRP Records team and other producers. His first LP is set for release in 2009. Hal is the only child of divorced parents Cheryl Linton and David Linton, two classically trained musicians. From as early as two years old Hal hit the stage with his mother. Raised as a Seventh Day Adventist, his parents from early instilled the moral and religious values of the Bible in him and his everyday life. His early schooling came at the Charles F Broomes Memorial School and the Ellerslie Secondary School. He then went on to earn a Bachelors Degree in Design at the Barbados Community College. Excelling in the field of Design he was awarded a fully paid National Academic Scholarship in Barbados to gain his Masters at the Savannah School of Art & Design. However Hal deferred the scholarship on the urgings of his music manager Teneille Doyle to pursue a career in music and entertainment. In 2005, as part of the internship program for his BA in Design, Hal went to work at CRS Music Studio. It was there that his creativity excelled leading him into the production of his self produced independent album "Spirit:Life:Love", released in 2006. The first single "Cardiac Arrest" went on to characterize Hal Linton to Barbados and the rest of the Caribbean region as the soul prince of the Caribbean. Likened to musical legends Marvin Gaye, Prince and even D'Angelo, he was nominated for eight awards at the 2007 Barbados Music Awards where he won four - Best New Artist, Song of the Year, R&B Song of the Year and Songwriter of the Year. Soon after he did his debut live performance at the Barbados Jazz Festival to raving reviews. ..he was inspired by his best friend Bandye Warner.Soul newcomer Hal Linton  really stole the show. At times, recalling the torched magic of Bilal or the burly heat of Omar, the fresh-faced Linton demonstrated the island's burgeoning R&B scene with infectious originals, such as the driving "Shake It Off" and his regional hit single, "Cardiac Arrest." But it was his ragamuffin makeover of Al Green's "Let's Stay Together" that sent the most chills down the enthusiastic audience's back. - John Murph (BET) 2007 After hearing such raving reviews, production company Syndicated Rhythm Entertainment (SRP Records) run by Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers responsible for Rihanna, Shontelle, and The Urgency put a deal on the table for the young artist in January 2007. Opting not to work with the production company at that time, Hal Linton moved to the USA with his manager Teneille Doyle who secured a spot on the Heineken Red Star Soul tour for him. Suffering many disappointments and setback the duo persevered and in interviews cite "God as their refuge and their strength." In September 2007, the Government of Barbados, through a division responsible for the export and development of culture "Invest Barbados," through their representative Tonika Sealy, made a large financial commitment to the Hal Linton project to assist in securing him a recording deal and promote his full export potential. This was the first time that the Barbados Government had made such a commitment to any artist. It was through that funding that Hal Linton showcased around the USA, worked with various producers and met music business executives. By May 2008, Hal and his manager had three production deals on the table, including another offer from SRP Productions who they later signed to. By July 2008 they had captured the interest of Universal Motown President Sylvia Rhone who signed him.
