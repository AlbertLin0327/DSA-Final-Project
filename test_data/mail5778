Coordinates: 525524N 03835W / 52.92335N 0.64297W / 52.92335; -0.64297 Central Technology & Sports College was a secondary school located in the north of Grantham in Lincolnshire, England. It is a co-educational school for ages 11-16. It is situated directly north of the Grantham and District Hospital off Sandcliffe Road, between the A607 and the East Coast Main Line, which borders on to the western edge of the school's playing fields. The River Witham is around 300 metres to the east. The Central School has its origins in the Central and Day Continuation School built behind the Town Hall in 1920. In the late 1920s, the school caught fire and burnt down, from a fire started in the boiler room. There later followed two single sex secondary modern schools, the Boys' Central School on Sandon Road and the Girls' Central School on Castlegate, situated in the town centre. The Boys' Central School was built in 1928. For two years previously the school was at Middlemore House in Castlegate. The Girls' Central School became Walton Girls High School in 1966 on Kitty Briggs Lane, next to the newly-built bypass, off the A607. Walton Girls is now an 11-18 school, with boys in the sixth form. The former site of the Boys' Central School is now the Little Gonerby Church of England Infant School[1], which moved to the site in January 1986, from its site in Albion Street it had been at since 1863. In 1978 a new school was built on the Manthorpe estate next to Grantham and District Hospital. When the new site was opened, it admitted girls as a coeducational school. In the 1990s it had around 550 pupils. In 2010 it became part of the Priory Ruskin Academy. A new building is planned to be built on the Manthorpe site in the next few years. For many years, the school received GCSE results slightly under the England average. It received the best results for co-educational schools in Grantham, notably as good or better than most comprehensive schools in Lincoln. However, co-educational schools of its type in nearby Bourne and Sleaford did slightly better. Similar to the Central School, these schools have also become academies, with a change of the school name, and joining with other lower-performing schools.
