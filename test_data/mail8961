Georges Cochon (1879-1959) was a tapestry maker, an anarchist and the secretary of the Federation of Tenants.[1] He was born on March 26, 1879 in Chartres, France. In 1912 in Paris he developed a strategy to move tenants with overdue rent out of their apartments, so their furniture could not be confiscated. He died on April 25, 1959.[2]
