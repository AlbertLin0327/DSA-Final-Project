Balally (Irish: Baile Amhlaoibh, meaning "Olafs' Town"), Dublin, Ireland, is a residential area at the southern end of Dundrum, Dublin between Dundrum village and the Sandyford Industrial Estate in Sandyford. Balally Parish itself reaches from Ardglas to the M50 motorway. It has 2 primary schools (St. Olaf's National School and Queen of Angels) and 2 secondary schools (St. Tiernan's and Wesley College). Balally is part of the conurbation of Greater Dublin, in the county of Dn Laoghaire-Rathdown. The area contains a Luas tram station, located near the southern entrance to the new Dundrum Town Centre. It was originally farmland and is located at the foot of the Wicklow Mountains. It consists of: Balally Drive, Balally Hill, Balally Grove, Balally Close, Balally Park, Balally Avenue & Balally Road, and Sandyford Road. It has been re-connected to Sandyford Road at Balally Hill after access was closed off due to cars cutting through the estate to beat the traffic congestion. The area is named after Olaf (Amhlaoibh), the first King of Viking Dublin, who is reputed to have built a fort in the locality. The place name Baile Mhic Amhlaoibh, meaning "the town of the son of Olaf" was anglicised as Balally. The local primary school, St. Olaf's National School, has more than 350 students. The Church of the Ascension of the Lord, the local Roman Catholic church, was built in 1982. It is serviced by the buses: 44, 44B, 44C from Townsend Street, Dublin City Centre, and 114 from Blackrock Dart Station but there is no Sunday service on 114. The 116 also serves the area, going from Lesson Street once a day Monday to Friday in the afternoon and once in the morning to Parnell Square.
