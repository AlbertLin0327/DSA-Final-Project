The Government of Ontario refers to the provincial government of the province of Ontario, Canada. Its powers and structure are set out in the Constitution Act, 1867. In modern Canadian use, the term "government" refers broadly to the cabinet of the day, selected from members the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, and to the non-political civil service staff within each provincial department or agency. The civil service that manages and delivers government policies, programs, and services is called the Ontario Public Service. The province of Ontario is governed by a unicameral legislature, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, which operates in the Westminster system of government. The political party that wins the largest number of seats in the legislature normally forms the government, and the party's leader becomes premier of the province, i.e., the head of government. Due to the location of the Ontario Legislature on the grounds of Queen's Park, the Ontario government is frequently referred to by the metonym "Queen's Park". The Ontario Public Service was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Maclean's newsmagazine in 2009, and again in 2010. The Ontario Public Service was also named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers by the Toronto Star in 2009, and was named one of "Canada's Best Diversity Employers" in 2009 by Bank of Montreal[1] The functions of the Sovereign, Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, and known in Ontario as the Queen in Right of Ontario, are exercised by the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario. The Lieutenant Governor is appointed by the Governor General of Canada on the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada, in consultation with the Premier of Ontario. The executive powers in the province lie with the Premier of Ontario and the cabinet. The legislative powers in the province lie with the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. The Premier and the cabinet are also members of the legislature. For the 2010-2011 fiscal year, the Ontario government planned to spend CAD129,000,000,000, including a deficit of CAD19,000,000,000.[2]
