Snake Party (also called Snake's Head Movement or Harakat Ras Al Afa) is composed substantially of former Baath Party and Saddam Hussein loyalists that are engaged in the Iraqi insurgency. This group originated from the Baath Party in Hawija and aspired to be a political party to oppose the multinational forces' presence in Iraq. Some have alleged that the party has links to tribes around Falluja and Ramadi.[1] Al-Ahram reported in 2003 that the organization was one of several that target those who collaborate with occupation forces.[2] Some call the Snake Party fanatics and Arab Sunni street gangs. Supporters of the Snake Party say it is an organized and legitimate paramilitary movement.
