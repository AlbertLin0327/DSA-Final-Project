Michael had moved to Nashville to become a country songwriter/performer, recording one album for Broken Bow Records in 2002 under the name J. Michael Harter.[1] Scott went to school in San Diego where he played in alternative rock bands.[2] Leslie remained in Arizona where she decided at age 18 that she was going to pursue a career in music. In 2005, the Harters recorded one single, "Drunk Chick," under the name SEVEN, with David Malloy as producer.[1] After deciding that they would begin performing together, they began recording videos of themselves on YouTube.[3] They were discovered by producer Keith Stegall, best known for his work as Alan Jackson's producer.[4] The Harters also caught the attention of Adam Gregory, with whom they collaborated[5] when the two acts shared the stage for a children's charity show.[6] The band was subsequently asked to open a series of shows for Josh Turner.[7] The Harters were also featured in People.com's July 2009 Photo Special.[8] The Harters made two songs available for free download on its website, including the debut single "Jenny."[9] Scott and Michael began writing the song five years before its release, and completed it with assistance from Malloy and Brad Irby.[2] This song debuted at number 54 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts dated for the week ending March 20, 2010[10] and peaked at number 53.[11] The album's second single "If I Run" released to country radio in 2011.
