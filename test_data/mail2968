His work, heavily influenced by Japanese ceramics, has been exhibited internationally and is held in many major public and private collections around the world. While living in Japan he worked closely with the artist Akio Takamori and in the studio of Jun Kaneko. He is Professor Emeritus of Art at the University of Manitoba, where he taught for 23 years, retiring in 1991. He also taught at the Rhode Island School of Design. In 2003 he became an artist laureate recipient of the Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts, Canada's highest artistic honor.
