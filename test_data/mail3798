Fitzroy (18971901, 1903, 1911) Christopher Kiernan (23 March 1878  2 December 1925) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Fitzroy in the early years of the Victorian Football League (VFL) and first-class cricketer. Kiernan was a Fitzroy local and played for the Maroons in the inaugural VFL season, topping their goalkicking in their first two years, and again in 1900. He played in Fitzroy's 1898 premiership side as well as in two losing grand finals. No stranger to controversy, Kiernan was accused of tripping his opponents in games, an accusation which was first raised by his own teammates following an interstate game. He fell out with the Fitzroy committee and in 1904 attempted to cross to Collingwood but his request was blocked by VFL delegates. Kiernan instead joined Victorian Football Association (VFA) club Brighton, but made a brief comeback at Fitzroy in 1911. With his football career over, Kiernan turned his attention to cricket and from 1910 to 1919 played 10 first-class matches for Victoria, three of them in the Sheffield Shield. He scored a total of 366 runs at an average of 24.40 and took six wickets.
