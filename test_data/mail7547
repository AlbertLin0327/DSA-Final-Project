Saint-Martin was a train station on the Blainville-Saint-Jerome Line (AMT). The station was one of the original four stations of the temporary Blainville line opened in 1997 to serve commuters during the construction on the Marius-Dufresne bridge. The station was closed in April 2007 with the opening of the Montreal Metro in Laval, due to its proximity to the De La Concorde station, 1.65km south. The station was located at Boulevard Saint Martin. This station had 190 parking spaces[1]. Saint-Martin Junction, a former Canadian Pacific Railway station, was located further north at the point where the CP lines, now QGR lines, to Ottawa and Quebec City separated. This station was used by Via Rail until January 1990. Coordinates: 453423N 734259W / 45.5731N 73.7163W / 45.5731; -73.7163
