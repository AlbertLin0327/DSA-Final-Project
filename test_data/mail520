Laflche is a neighbourhood in the Saint-Hubert borough of the city of Longueuil. Laflche is primarily a densely-populated residential neighbourhood. It is largely low-income, and similar to Ville LeMoyne and other parts of the Le Vieux-Longueuil borough. Most buildings in the area are single-family homes, but there are also many small apartment buildings scattered throughout the neighbourhood. Boulevard Taschereau, Boulevard douard and Chemin de la Grande Alle are the main arteries in Laflche, and all three feature numerous businesses. Laflche is reputed for its small house built with tar up planks taken from the rail industry. A good proportion of the first inhabitants of the neighboourhood worked at the Canadian National plant in Pointe-Saint-Charles, which made it easier for workers to carry large pieces of wood in Laflche to build houses. The oldest house of the neighborhood is on Duke street. It was built at the end of the 19th century. Laflche is a neighbourhood that was built mostly between 1930 to 1960. During the beginning of the 20th century, the territory was part of the Saint-Antoine de Longueuil Parish. Originally known as St-Lambert Heights, the name of the land was changed to Mackayville in honor of a Montreal notary who managed the development of the land in the 1920s. With the opening of Jacques-Cartier Bridge in 1930 and the steadily increase of cars, many Montreal working families moved to the South Shore, including Mackayville. Montreal and Southern Counties Railway had a tram stop in Mackayville at the corner Grande-Alle and Edouard. The building, which eventually became a Perette convenience store, still exists today. Mackayville became an independent city in 1947 at the same time as neighbouring Ville Jacques-Cartier. Mackayville got its first sewer in 1956. The city changed its name to Laflche on March 5, 1959. It later merged with the city of St. Hubert in October 1971, when its population was about 15,000. Throughout the 1970s, Laflche was nicknamed petit Saint-Henri de la Rive-Sud (the little Saint-Henri of the South Shore) because its inhabitants were viewed as being rough. In 2001, the district of Laflche was estimated to have just under 17,000 people. This makes it around the same size as the neighbouring borough of Greenfield Park. The below figures are based on the three census tracts that form Laflche.[2] Language From Canada 2006 Census The city hall, police station and fire station of Laflche were located at the corner of Boulevard Grande-Alle and Rue Georges. Laflche is bordered by Boulevard Taschereau to the west, Route 116 to the north, Boulevard Kimber to the east and Rue Robillard/Balmoral to the south.
