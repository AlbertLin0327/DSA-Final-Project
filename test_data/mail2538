The Macau women's national football team, represents Macau in international women's association football and is governed by Macau Football Association (MFA). The team has not played any official match so far. The national federation became a FIFA affiliate in 1979.[1] In 1985, almost no country in the world had a women's national football team.[2] As of 1999, the women's national team has not competed at the Women's World Cup though they have taken part in qualifying tournaments. In 1986, they finished third out of four teams in their group. In 1998, they also finished third out of four in their regional qualifying group. They also have not competed at the Asian Women's Championships as of 1999.[3] In March 2012, the team was not ranked in the world by FIFA.[4] The country's kit colours are red and green shirts, red or white shorts, and red or white socks.[1]
