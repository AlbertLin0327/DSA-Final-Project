Tim Mudde (Amsterdam, 23 February 1965), also known as Brigadier M or Sassem Tim, is active within the right wing radical movement in the Netherlands. He was party secretary of the Centre Party '86[1] (an offshoot of the Centre Party) and like many other senior members of this party became active for Voorpost[2][3] and later founded the Nationale Beweging, the nationalist mail order company Fenris and the nationalist internet radio station Radio Rapaille where he presented several shows.[4] Mudde played in the Rock Against Communism (RAC) band Brigade M[5] and the Feyenoord themed Oi! band Foienoord.[6] He is the older brother of the renowned political scientist Cas Mudde, who studies rightist movements. In 1996 Mudde was one of the two founders of Brigade M, which initially was called Brigade Mussert referring to the personal bodyguards of Anton Mussert.[7] Mudde was also a member of other RAC/Nationalistic bands: Dietse Patriotten, Die Fnfte Kolonne, Distrikt 217, H6, O.D.M., Oi-Die-Poes and Sassem Bootbois (later called Sassem Boot Boys).[8] Mudde is also involved with the RAC record companies Sassem Produkties[9] and Muziek met wortels (Music with Roots). On 22 October 2005 he gave a speech for the National Alliance party about the Antifa. Mudde considers himself to be a nationalist rather than a national socialist. In the 1980s and 1990s he was convicted several times for offenses dealing with "hate speech".[10][11] Nazism/ neo-Nazism Nationalism National Socialism National-Anarchism White separatism Fourteen Words White pride and White power Aryan race White power skinhead Eugenics Antisemitism Anti-Arabism Islamophobia Antiziganism Hispanophobia Ku Klux Klan Christian Identity Zionist Occupation Government Far-right/ neo-fascism Third Position Wotanism Kinism Virginia Abernethy Richard Barrett Gordon Lee Baum Louis Beam Vincent Bertollini Don Black Prussian Blue Richard Girnt Butler Willis Carto Craig Cobb Harold Covington Ian Davison David Duke James Edwards Samuel T.
