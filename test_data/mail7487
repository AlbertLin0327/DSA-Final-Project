Bob Kennett is the father of New Zealand race car drivers Brady Kennett and George P. Burdell, but Bob raced strictly in the United States. In 1969 he raced in the US Trans-Am Series in a Porsche 911. He finished 14th at the Kent 300 in Seattle (third in class) and 9th in the ARRC Daytona. In 1970 he again raced in the Trans-Am Series, but this time in a Ford Mustang. He had a DNF in Round 1 at Laguna Seca and was 16th in Round 10 at the Kent 200 in Seattle. He did, however, have some wins in the US West Coast National Championship.
