The HealthLine (formerly known as the Silver Line[2], and the Euclid Corridor Transportation Project) is a bus rapid transit line run by the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The line runs along Euclid Avenue from Public Square in downtown Cleveland to the Louis Stokes Station at Windermere in East Cleveland. It began operation on October 24, 2008.[3] By late 2009, ridership had expanded 47 percent compared to the former line running along the same route prior to the completion of the Euclid Corridor project and the creation of the HealthLine.[4] The HealthLine runs a fleet of 21 articulated DE60LFA-BRT vehicles, manufactured by New Flyer Industries, each with a seating capacity of 47 and able to accommodate 53 more standing up. The vehicles run on a diesel-electric hybrid motor system that produce 90% less emissions than regular buses.[5] A low sulfur diesel engine (A Cummins ISL-09)generates electrical power to run smaller electric motors mounted on each of the wheels.[6] Each vehicle also has a GPS locator on board, which allows automated traffic signals to give the HealthLine buses priority at busy intersections, keeping them moving as much as possible. Three doors on each side of the vehicle make for fast and easy boarding and unboarding.[7] However, as late as July 2010, the trip from East Cleveland to downtown during rush hour was more than 40 minutes  longer than the planned 33 minutes. This was due to traffic light timing and the 25 mph speed limit along most of the route. The speed limit was raised to 35 mph for buses and traffic light timing was adjusted further to combat this issue.[8][9] There are 59 stations along Euclid Avenue that serve the HealthLine. All stations are equipped with a fare card vending machine, 24-hour lighting, and an emergency phone. An illuminated text display informs passengers of expected arrival times. Between Public Square and East 107th Street, all stations have raised platforms that align with the floor of the rapid transit vehicle, making for very easy boarding and alighting.[10] The HealthLine route travels 6.8 miles (11km) along Euclid Avenue from Public Square in Downtown Cleveland to Louis Stokes Station at Windermere in East Cleveland. It passes through the neighborhoods of Downtown, Midtown, Fairfax, University Circle, and the suburb of East Cleveland.[11] Between Public Square and East 105th Street, Euclid Avenue has two "bus only" lanes close to the inner median which only allow HealthLine vehicles passage. This keeps the buses from fighting regular traffic during busy times. Complementing the HealthLine is a set of bike lanes on the outer edges of the stretch Euclid Avenue that connects Cleveland State University with Case Western Reserve University.[12] The HealthLine provides 24-hour service and comes as frequently as every five minutes during busy rush hour times. The full set of arrival frequencies are:[13]
