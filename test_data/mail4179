Gary Haisman (January 29th, 1958  present) was a white male English singer/rapper who was one of three acts who scored a #1 chart topper on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart as a featured performer on D Mob's "A Little Bit Of This, A Little Bit of That" album (Cathy Dennis and LRS were the other two). His contribution to the set was the two-sided track "We Call It Acieed"/"Trance Dance", which was D Mob's first of four straight #1 hits on the Dance chart in 1989. Haisman now works as a part time painter/decorator in the Slough area.
