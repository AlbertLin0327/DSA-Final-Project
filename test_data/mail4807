Gloria Mann was an American pop singer born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Mann scored two hits on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1955. The first was a version of "Earth Angel", which reached #18. Later that year, "Teen Age Prayer" peaked at #19; this featured Sid Bass leading the backing orchestra. Both were released on Sound Records. Mann's son, Bob Rosenberg, later formed the group Will to Power.
