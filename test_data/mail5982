Sir Leslie Edmund Percy Riggs Falkiner, 7th Baronet (1866-19 January 1917) was an English baronet. He was born in 1866, the eldest son of Sir Samuel Edmund Falkiner, 6th Baronet, and educated at Marlborough College and in HMS Worcester. He succeeded his father to the baronetcy in 1893, and married twice - once in 1894 and again in 1902. On his own death the title passed to his eldest son, Sir Terence Edmond Patrick Falkiner, 8th Baronet, who was aged just 13 at the time.
