Krishnarao Palem is a village in Chatrai mandal, Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh, India. This is well known for the growth of mangoes besides which paddy is also cultivated. The water source for the irrigation is from Pedda cheruvu, voora cheruvu, venkata reddy cheruvu, etc. Hanuman temple in the village is constructed with Sita Rama Laxmana idols on the facade of the temple. The people from this village have welcoming attitude towards known or unknown guests. They consider a guest is Him arriving at their doors. Even the poorest people in India will do their utmost care to make sure their guests are well looked after. The village shares khammam and Krishna districts. This village gives a humble look and its great attitude to revere the visiting guests. However, the village gives pitiable look with its low income GDP. For social scientists, property was and in some gauge remains not only the decisive but the sole source of power. Galbraith infers that as long as it remains in private hands no others can possess power. There remains the question of how extensively the state should intervene to get a wider distribution of property (and associated income) and thus of the power emanating there from. The basic problem in the village is lack of educated people. Behnassi.M et al. (eds) pointed out a combination of factors that cause food crisis. Some of the key components lead to crises: 1. lack of food entitlement 2. poor governance, 3. Struggle between increases in population and food; 4. total growing consumer demand combined with proximity to further yield growth of key crops; 5. Under-investment in agricultural research; 6. More on Gene Revolution; 7. Conflict and poverty; 8. Diversion of food crops for feed and fuel; 9. Global environmental change: Most relevant causes that lead crises:(Behnassi.M et al.; 2011) 1. energy shortage and prices, biofuels, global warming, fresh water shortage, economic chaos, higher population levels, inefficient agricultural policies, soil degradation and grabbing, loss of crop varieties and genetic contamination, farmer shortages, fish declines, general ignorance of food and inadequate governance. Of fruits pride of place is taken by Mango which is grown in orchards and is much valued in the world. The basic livestock of the peasant is cattle, used for farm land tilling and transport. Ms. Priya Basu, a leading Senior economist in world bank expresses in her book that as efforts are made to improve the formal financial sector's ability to serve the poor, microfinance can play an important role in the interim. The term 'microfinance' typically covers the poor in rural, semi-urban, and urban areas, the focus here is on the rural poor. Farmers dont see the cultivation as a profitable profession. Villagers do have meager medical facilities in the area. Agriculture based processing industries are yet to be encouraged. Policies and political administration should get more involved for the betterment of the livelihood of villagers with better infrastructure and encourage the children from villages especially girls to go for higher education. People should emulate others who send their children for higher education. A farmer in forties expressed concern about education: At the age of six, I had to walk 5km to and from the nearest primary school, going in scabby clothes. When I was ten I had to drop from my schooling because I caught some fever. As I am aware about the education and its value, I sent my eldest daughter to complete electronics & communication engineering who is now in USA and my son pursuing the same engineering degree.
