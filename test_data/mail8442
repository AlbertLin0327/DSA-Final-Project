Karlology: What I've Learnt So Far is the third book written by Karl Pilkington. It was released on 1 October 2008 in the United Kingdom and published by Dorling Kindersley. Karlology is formatted like a school curriculum with subjects including history, English and biology. By posing naive questions to experts and musing on his own educational experiences, Pilkington aims to present fascinating facts and myths with humour. The book contains stories of places Karl has visited, such as the National History Museum. Karl has also illustrated the book, though artwork for chapter openers was completed by Jess Bentall. Celebrities such as fellow podcaster Ricky Gervais and comic Noel Fielding contributed facts to the book.
