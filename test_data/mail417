Columbia Country Classics was a multi-volume set of recordings released in 1990 by Legacy Recordings. The collection contains 128 tracks from the Columbia, Epic and associated recording labels, and covers a span from the mid-1930s through the late 1980s. Columbia Country Classics was issued on either five compact discs or cassette tapes; for a time, customers could also purchase the series on vinyl albums. Each volume contained annotated essays covering the periods featured on each disc. The five discs covered a different era, as follows: Significant artists whose works were included were the Carter Family, Sons of the Pioneers, Bob Wills, Roy Acuff, Johnny Cash, Ray Price, Willie Nelson, George Jones, Merle Haggard, Charlie Rich, Tanya Tucker, Statler Brothers and Larry Gatlin.
