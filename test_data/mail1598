In linear algebra, the Frobenius normal form, Turner binormal projective form or rational canonical form of a square matrix A is a canonical form for matrices that reflects the structure of the minimal polynomial of A and provides a means of detecting whether another matrix B is similar to A without extending the base field F. The Frobenius normal form M of a matrix A with entries in a field F can be obtained from it by means of a similarity transformation. What this implies is that there is an invertible matrix P with entries in F for which P1AP = M. Every matrix can be transformed by a similarity transformation to its Frobenius normal form. For example, let F be the field R of real numbers, consider the following matrix A, over R: The characteristic polynomial of A is x6 + 6x4 + 12x2 + 8 = (x2 + 2)3 = p(x). The minimal polynomial of this matrix is x2 + 2. We will then have one block in the Frobenius normal form as The characteristic polynomial of A1 is indeed x2 + 2. Since p factors into solely terms of the form x2 + 2, we expect the other two blocks comprising the normal form of the matrix to be identical to A1. So, we can simply write down the Frobenius normal form: The characteristic and minimal polynomials of M are the same as those of A, which we would expect, since M can be obtained via a similarity transformation P1AP = M, and determinants are similarity invariant. For this matrix A, P is Fix a base field F and a finite-dimensional vector space V over F. Given a polynomial p(x)  F[x], there is associated to it a companion matrix C whose characteristic polynomial is p(x). Theorem: Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field F, and A a square matrix over F. Then V (viewed as an F[x]-module with the action of x given by A and extending by linearity) satisfies the F[x]-module isomorphism where the ai(x)  F[x] may be taken to be non-units, unique as monic polynomials, and can be arranged to satisfy the relation where "a | b" is notation for "a divides b". Sketch of Proof: Apply the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain to V, viewing it as an F[x]-module. Note that any free F[x]-module is infinite-dimensional over F, so that the resulting direct sum decomposition has no free part since V is finite-dimensional. The uniqueness of the invariant factors requires a separate proof that they are determined up to units; then the monic condition ensures that they are uniquely determined. The proof of this latter part is omitted. See [DF] for details. Given an arbitrary square matrix, the elementary divisors used in the construction of the Jordan normal form do not exist over F[x], so the invariant factors ai(x) as given above must be used instead. These correspond to factors of the minimal polynomial m(x) = an(x), which (by the CayleyHamilton theorem) itself divides the characteristic polynomial p(x) and in fact has the same roots as p(x), not counting multiplicities. Note in particular that the Theorem asserts that the invariant factors have coefficients in F. As each invariant factor ai(x) is a polynomial in F[x], we may associate a corresponding block matrix Ci which is the companion matrix to ai(x). In particular, each such Ci has its entries in the field F. Taking the matrix direct sum of these blocks over all the invariant factors yields the rational canonical form of A. Where the minimal polynomial is identical to the characteristic polynomial, the Frobenius normal form is the companion matrix of the characteristic polynomial. As the rational canonical form is uniquely determined by the unique invariant factors associated to A, and these invariant factors are independent of basis, it follows that two square matrices A and B are similar if and only if they have the same rational canonical form. The Frobenius normal form does not reflect any form of factorization of the characteristic polynomial, even if it does exist over the ground field F. This implies that it is invariant when F is replaced by a different field (as long as it contains the entries of the original matrix A). On the other hand this makes the Frobenius normal form rather different than other normal forms that do depend on factoring the characteristic polynomial, notably the diagonal form (if A is diagonalizable) or more generally the Jordan normal form (if the characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors). For instance, the Frobenius normal form of a diagonal matrix with distinct diagonal entries is just the companion matrix of its characteristic polynomial. There is another way to define a normal form, that like the Frobenius normal form is always defined over the same field F as A, but that does reflect a possible factorization of the characteristic polynomial (or equivalently the minimal polynomial) into irreducible factors over F, and which reduces to the Jordan normal form in case this factorization only contain linear factors (corresponding to eigenvalues). This form[1] is sometimes called the generalized Jordan normal form, or primary rational canonical form. It is based on the fact that the vector space can be canonically decomposed into a direct sum of stable subspaces corresponding to the distinct irreducible factors P of the characteristic polynomial (as stated by the lemme des noyaux), where the characteristic polynomial of each summand is a power of the corresponding P. These summands can be further decomposed, non-canonically, as a direct sum of cyclic F[x]-modules (like is done for the Frobenius normal form above), where the characteristic polynomial of each summand is still a (generally smaller) power of P. The primary rational canonical form is a block diagonal matrix corresponding to such a decomposition into cyclic modules, with a particular form called generalized Jordan block in the diagonal blocks, corresponding to a particular choice of a basis for the cyclic modules. This generalized Jordan block is itself a block matrix of the form where C is the companion matrix of the irreducible polynomial P, and U is a matrix whose sole nonzero entry is a 1 in the upper right hand corner. For the case of a linear irreducible factor P = x  , these blocks are reduced to single entries C =  and U = 1 and, one finds a (transposed) Jordan block. In any generalized Jordan block, all enrties immediately below the main diagonal are 1. A basis of the cyclic module giving rise to this form is obtained by choosing a generating vector v (one that is not annihilated by Pk1(A) where the minimal polynomial of the cyclic module is Pk), and taking as basis where d = deg(P).
