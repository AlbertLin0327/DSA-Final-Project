Red Razors is a 2000 AD comic strip created by Mark Millar and set in the Judge Dredd universe. However, the time of the stories take place roughly fifty years after the events detailed in current Judge Dredd comics. The series first debuted in Judge Dredd Megazine #1.08 in 1991. The stories focus on a Sov-Block (formerly East-Meg Two, formerly somewhere in Russia) Judge named Razors. Judge Razors is the prototype for a new breed of Judge, a brainwashed ex-gang member, conditioned to follow the orders of his superiors without question. His partner is a genetically enhanced horse named Comrade Ed. The first storyline focused on the penetration of western culture and capitalism behind the iron curtain (for example, Elvis Presley is worshipped as a God). The storyline can be thought of as a satirical comment on Russia's current integration of western elements with its own culture. Subsequent entries were much more action-oriented, with little or no satire. Cameos in the series have included Judge Dredd. In his last appearance, Razors threw off his brainwashing and went on a killing spree, which ended when he was shot and killed by Dredd. Also there are obvious references in the series to other series (TV especially.) The main example is Comrade Ed, Razor's partner which is an obvious "take off" of Mister Ed, the talking horse. The three stories from the Megazine and 2000 AD have been collected in a trade paperback:
