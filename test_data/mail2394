Givat Haim (Meuhud) (Hebrew:   (), lit. Haim Hill (Unified)) is a kibbutz near Hadera in Israel. It is located within the Hefer Valley Regional Council. It was formed in 1952 by an ideological split in kibbutz Givat Haim (founded 1932), with Mapai-supporting members breaking away to create Givat Haim (Ihud), which joined the Mapai-affiliated Ihud HaKvutzot veHaKibbutzim, whilst Mapam-supporting members formed Givat Haim (Meuhad) which joined the HaKibbutz HaMeuhad movement. Today both kibbutzim belong to the Kibbutz Movement. As well as agriculture, the kibbutz is home to Prigat, a major soft drink company in Israel.
