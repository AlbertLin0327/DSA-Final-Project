At the 1904 Summer Olympics, twenty-five athletics events were contested, all for men only. A total of 74 medals (25 gold, 26 silver, 23 bronze) were awarded. Multi-event competitions, the decathlon and triathlon, were introduced. The short steeplechase was lengthened slightly, from 2500 to 2590 metres, while the long steeplechase was eliminated. The 5000 metre team race was replaced with the 4 mile team race (6,437m). A 56 pound weight throw was added. In all, the 25 events featured in 1904 were 2 more than were held in 1900. 233 athletes from 10 nations competed. This figure includes the athletic triathlon event, which some sources exclude. Australia, Cuba, Hungary, South Africa, and Switzerland had athletes compete, but won no medals. France is often credited with Coray's competition, which would put that nation 4th with 1 silver medal and move Germany and Greece to a tie for 6th in the standings. Arriving without correct documents, Coray wound up listed with the US team.[1]
