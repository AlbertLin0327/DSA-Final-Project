The fractional Schrdinger equation is a fundamental equation of fractional quantum mechanics. It was discovered by Nick Laskin (1999) as a result of extending the Feynman path integral, from the Brownian-like to Lvy-like quantum mechanical paths. The term fractional Schrdinger equation was coined by Nick Laskin.[1] The fractional Schrdinger equation has the following form:[2] Here \mathbf{r} is a 3-dimensional vector, \hbar is the Planck constant, \psi(\mathbf{r},t) is the wavefunction, which is the quantum mechanical probability amplitude for the particle to have a given position \mathbf{r} at any given time t, V(\mathbf{r},t) is a potential energy, and \Delta =\partial ^2/\partial \mathbf{r}^2 is the Laplace operator. Further, D_\alpha is a scale constant with physical dimension [D_\alpha ]=\mathrm{erg}^{1-\alpha }\cdot \mathrm{cm}^\alpha \cdot \mathrm{sec}^{-\alpha } , (at =2, D2 =1/2m, where m is a particle mass), and the operator (-\hbar ^2\Delta )^{\alpha /2} is the 3-dimensional fractional quantum Riesz derivative defined by Here the wave functions in the space \psi(\mathbf{r},t) and momentum \varphi (\mathbf{p},t) representations are related each other by the 3-dimensional Fourier transforms The index  in the fractional Schrdinger equation is the Lvy index, 1<2. Thus, the fractional Schrdinger equation includes a space derivative of fractional order  instead of the second order (=2) space derivative in the standard Schrdinger equation. Thus, the fractional Schrdinger equation is a fractional differential equation in accordance with modern terminology.[3] This is the main point of the term fractional Schrdinger equation or a more general term fractional quantum mechanics.[4] At =2 fractional Schrdinger equation becomes the well-known Schrdinger equation. The fractional Schrdinger equation has the following operator form where the fractional Hamilton operator \widehat{H}_\alpha is given by The Hamilton operator, \widehat{H}_\alpha corresponds to classical mechanics Hamiltonian function where \mathbf{p} and \mathbf{r} are the momentum and the coordinate respectively. The special case when the Hamiltonian H_\alpha is independent of time is of great importance for physical applications. It is easy to see that in this case there exist the special solution of the fractional Schrdinger equation where \phi (\mathbf{r}) satisfies or This is the time-independent fractional Schrdinger equation. Thus, we see that the wave function \psi (\mathbf{r},t) oscillates with a definite frequency. In classical physics the frequency corresponds to the energy. Therefore, the quantum mechanical state has a definite energy E. The probability to find a particle at \mathbf{r} is the absolute square of the wave function | \psi (\mathbf{r},t) |^2 . Because of time-independent fractional Schrdinger equation this is equal to | \phi (\mathbf{r})|^2 and does not depend upon the time. That is, the probability of finding the particle at \mathbf{r} is independent of the time. One can say that the system is in a stationary state. In other words, there is no variation in the probabilities as a function of time.
