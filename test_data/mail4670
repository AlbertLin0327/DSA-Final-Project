Watseka or Watchekee (c. 1810 - 1878) was a Potawatomi Native American woman, born in Illinois, and named for the heroine of a Potawatomi legend. Her uncle was Tamin, the chief of the Kankakee Potawatomi Indians. In 1824 she married Gurdon Saltonstall Hubbard. Hubbard and Watseka had two children, both of whom died in infancy. They mutually dissolved the union in 1826. Watseka eventually married Noel Le Vasseur. She had three children with Le Vasseur. In 1836, she left for Council Bluffs, Iowa, where her tribe had been removed in 1832 following the Treaty of Camp Tippecanoe. She died in Council Bluffs in 1878. The United States Navy tug USS Watseka (YT-387), and a city in East Central Illinois were named in her honor.
