The Perishers are a Swedish indie rock band. The band began in 1997 composed of six members, and since 2001 has consisted of Ola Klft (vocals, guitar), Martin Gustafson (keyboards, backing vocals), Pehr strm (bass), and Thomas Hedlund (drums). Although they have not had a major commercial breakthrough yet, they do have a fan base that stretches across Europe and North America due to notable tour performances and features on prominent television shows. For example, in 2005, the band was personally handpicked by Sarah McLachlan to open her second leg of the Afterglow tour. Each night of the tour, Sarah McLachlan joined the band and sang background vocals on their song 'Pills'. The live track was released as a promotional CD single and as an online exclusive EP via Tower Records later that year. Additionally, several of their songs have been played in episodes of the popular American television programs The O.C., One Tree Hill, Greek and, more noticeably, Veronica Mars, where the ballad "Sway" featured prominently in a climactic episode of Season Two. Also of note is the fact that Sarah Isaksson (Klft's former vocal teacher) is a featured artist on their song "Pills." More recently, their song 'My Heart' has been played on Saturn Sedan commercials as well as a second-season episode of the ABC Family show Kyle XY. Another song, 'Trouble Sleeping', was played in a promotional spot for Grey's Anatomy and the song 'Come Out of the Shade' was featured in an episode of the show. The band is currently on hiatus, Klft is currently working on a solo project in Vancouver, BC under the name A Lanky Swede. On April 14, 2011, he released his first single.
