Lawrence C. "Larry" Kaufman (born 1947) is a Grandmaster of chess. He currently lives in Potomac, Maryland. In 2008, as an International Master, Kaufman won the World Senior Championship (which he later retroactively shared with Mihai Suba) which automatically earned him the Grandmaster title.[1] A long time researcher in computer chess, he helped write the opening book for the pioneering program Mac Hack, co-developed Socrates II, edited the journal Computer Chess Reports, and worked on many other research and commercial chess engines.[2] He is also known for his work on computer chess engine Rybka 3,[3] and several books and articles, including The Evaluation of Material Imbalances. He currently helps develop the chess program Komodo with Don Dailey, with whom he had worked on the Socrates series of programs. He is also one of the strongest shogi players in the west. He learned the game by the traditional method of studying handicap theory and is one of the leading experts in this field.[4] His son Raymond is an International Master of chess.
