Charity Shield.jpg Regarded as the unofficial start to the National Rugby League (NRL) season, the Charity Shield has been in operation since 1982 (with the exception of 2000 and 2001 when Souths were omitted from the NRL). Originally contested between the South Sydney Rabbitohs and the St. George Dragons, and later by the St George Illawarra Dragons when they merged in 1999, the teams go head to head in an annual clash three weeks prior to the kickoff of the NRL season. Since its inception in 1982, the Charity Shield has been played on twenty-seven occasions. Of these, the Dragons (St George and St George Illawarra) have won 14 times, while South Sydney have triumphed outright on 9 occasions and retained the shield as the current holder in each of the 4 drawn matches. Broken down, St George played 17 matches, winning 11; while St George Illawarra, since their merger in 1999, have played 11 matches, winning 4. The match has been broadcast on national television and in 2002 for the first and only time was screened live in the UK. This is the only pre season game shown live on TV & has been the case since Souths were returned to the NRL in 2002.
