The second season of Phineas and Ferb started on Disney XD February 19, 2009, and on Disney Channel March 27, 2009. A preview of the season was on January 23, 2009 on Toon Disney, with the episode "Tip of the Day". The season features two step-brothers on summer vacation trying to make every day the best day ever, while their sister tries to bust them. The five main characters are: brothers Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher, their older sister Candace Flynn, secret agent Perry the Platypus, and the evil Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. Recurring characters are across-the-street neighbor Isabella Garcia-Shapiro, the boys' mom Linda Flynn-Fletcher, and Perry's boss, Major Monogram, Jeremy Johnson, Baljeet, Buford Van Stomm, Stacy Hirano, and many more. "Every episode since Flop Starz has song in it. It's not always the characters singing onscreen they do not break into song just to advance the plot. The music doesn't come out of nowhere, sometimes it's just a montage over action. We've done every genre known to man: ABBA, Broadway show tunes, 16th-century madrigals[...]" Episodes "Perry Lays an Egg/Gaming the System" on the Disney Channel achieved the most views by ages 611 and 914 of any channel in that night's time slot. This achievement propelled the series to the number one animated telecast that week for the target demographics.[1] On June 7, 2009, Disney announced that the show had become the number one prime-time animated television show for the demographics 610 and 914. The premiere of "Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation!" garnered 2.62 million viewers during its debut on Disney XD, the most watched telecast in the channel's history (including Toon Disney) and the number three program of the night in all demographics. It received 5.2 million viewers for its debut on Disney Channel. It was the highest rated episode of the series to date.[2][3][4] Disney has licensed a number of products from the show, including plush toys of characters Perry, Ferb, Candace, and Phineas.[5] Disney released several T-shirts for the show and launched a "Make your own T-shirt" program on its Disney website.[6] Authors have novelized several episodes.[7] Two season one DVDs, entitled The Fast and the Phineas and The Daze of Summer, have been released; the discs include episodes never broadcast in America.[8][9] A 3rd DVD is to be released on October 5, 2010, called "A Very Perry Christmas". Some reviewers were displeased that the discs covered selected episodes rather than providing box sets of whole series, but noted that Disney does not generally release full-season DVD sets.[8] In 2009 Disney licensed a Nintendo DS game, titled like the show, Phineas and Ferb. The game's story follows the title characters as they try to build a roller coaster to stop boredom over the summer. The player controls Phineas, Ferb, and occasionally Agent P (Perry the Platypus). Phineas scavenges for spare parts for the roller coaster while Ferb fixes various objects around town, gaining access to new areas as a result. Ferb can also construct new parts of the roller coaster and its vehicle-themed carts. Each activity features a short mini-game.[10][11][12] The game was well received and garners a 76.67% on GameRankings.[13] A sequel entitled Phineas and Ferb: Ride Again was released on September 14, 2010.
