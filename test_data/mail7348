Colin Howell (born 14 March 1959) is a Northern Irish convicted double murderer. Howell killed his wife Leslie (ne Clarke) and the husband of his lover, Trevor Buchanan (who was a RUC officer), in what appeared to be a suicide pact between two lovers. The bodies were found in a fume-filled car in Castlerock on May 19, 1991.[1] Howell, a dentist by occupation, was a deeply religious father of ten and a former lay preacher.[2] He married Leslie in July 1983. They were members of the local Baptist church. After his wife's death Howell remarried. Howell confessed his role in the murders to elders in his church who urged him to inform police.[3] He pleaded guilty to the murders on 18 November 2010 and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He was told he must serve a minimum 21 year jail term.[4] His former lover Hazel Stewart, a co-accused in the case, was found guilty of murder in March, 2011, and sentenced to life imprisonment.[5] On 17 May 2011 Howell pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting nine women patients in his surgery over a period of several years.[6]
