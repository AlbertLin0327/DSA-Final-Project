Paladyn, subtitled Journal of Behavioral Robotics, is a peer-reviewed scientific journal which focuses on approaches to robotics that draw on analogies between autonomous robotics and embodied cognition, cognitive development, and the emergence of cognition and communication from social behavior. It is an electronic-only journal that publishes research on topics broadly related to neuronally and psychologically inspired robots and other behaving autonomous systems, including cognitive robotics, developmental robotics, evolutionary robotics, artificial embodied agents, self-organizing robot swarms, robot learning and adaptation, human-robot interaction, and neurally-inspired robot vision. Paladyn is co-published by Versita and Springer Science+Business Media.[1] The editor-in-chief is Gregor Schner (Ruhr University Bochum).
