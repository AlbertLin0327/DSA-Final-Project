Scott Alan Eyre (born May 30, 1972 in Inglewood, California[1]) is a former left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball. Eyre attended the College of Southern Idaho in Twin Falls, Idaho and was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the 9th round of the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft. He was traded to the Chicago White Sox in 1994 and made his major league debut in Chicago on August 1, 1997. Eyre was traded in 2000 to the Toronto Blue Jays. Eyre was selected off waivers from the Blue Jays by the San Francisco Giants in 2002. He spent the next several seasons as an effective reliever for the Giants. On November 18, 2005, Eyre signed a three-year contract with the Chicago Cubs and pitched his way to an ERA of 3.38. He was one of the more consistently used relievers on a pitching staff that often struggled. He was used mainly in 7th and 8th inning situations in tandem with Bob Howry with Eyre being used more often in lefty vs. lefty situations. Eyre has noted that Lou Piniella could not remember his name for the longest time and called him "Stevie" for a while, jokingly, even after he learned Scott's real name. According to Cubs play-by-play broadcaster Len Kasper, Piniella has since begun intentionally pronouncing his name "Stevie Aye-er."[citation needed] During a game against the Houston Astros on September 12, 2007, Eyre left the Cubs bullpen, and wandered around Minute Maid Park. WGNs cameras eventually spotted him watching the game through an opening in the stadiums score board.[2] On June 15, 2008, in a game against the Toronto Blue Jays, Eyre allowed a 1-out sac fly run, ending his streak of 33 consecutive appearances without allowing a run, a Cubs franchise record. On August 5, 2008, Eyre was designated for assignment to make room for Kerry Wood, who was coming off the disabled list.[3] He was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies two days later for minor league pitcher Brian Schlitter.[4] However, the move allowed Eyre to win his first World Series ring when the Phillies won the 2008 World Series. In November, 2008, following the World Series, Scott resigned with the Phillies as a free-agent, and was signed through the 2009 season. On November 12, 2009, Eyre was granted free agency. On January 7, 2010, Scott Eyre retired from the MLB. Eyre's brother, Willie, is also a pitcher in the major leagues, currently pitching for the Baltimore Orioles. They also have another, younger brother, Robert Grace, who is playing in the minor league system of the San Francisco Giants. All three are pitchers. Eyre was one of the victims of the $8 billion dollar fraud perpetrated by wealth manager Allen Stanford. In February 2009 Eyre admitted that he was broke and had to receive an advance on his salary from the Phillies.[5] Eyre publicly acknowledged that he has adult attention-deficit disorder.[6]
