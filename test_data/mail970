Death Valley is an American horror, black comedy mockumentary, which premiered on August 29, 2011 on MTV. The series follows the 'Undead Task Force' (UTF), a newly formed division of the LAPD, documentary-style, as they capture the monsters that roam the streets of California's San Fernando Valley.
