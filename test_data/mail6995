Forfey Festival was founded in 2006 by Matt Minford, bassist and vocalist of SixStarHotel.[1] His family owned Forfey Farm, and for a number of years it had lain unused.[2] For the first two years of the festival's existence, Minford was unable to obtain an entertainments licence for the farm, and so musical performances were held at other locations in Fermanagh, while the farm hosted arts exhibitions and camping. Since 2008 the whole festival has been held annually on Forfey Farm.[2] Forfey is held on a small family farm. While the festival is in progress, one field is devoted to camping and one field to car parking. Music venues include two sheds and a cottage attic. Various outbuildings host exhibitions and film screenings.[3]
