Stella is a cattle ranching town situated in North West Province of South Africa between Vryburg and Mafikeng. Stella was named after the daughter of the farmer who owned the land on which the town was founded in the 1920s. The area is commonly called Stellaland after the Republic of Stellaland. The Stella Beesfees (Cattle Festival) is held every year during October. The town has a High School, but this also houses the nursery and primary pupils.
