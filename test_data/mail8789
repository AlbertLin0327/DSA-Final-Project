Lionel Djebi-Zadi (born 20 May 1982 in Lyon) is a French footballer currently a free agent having most recently played for Inverness Caledonian Thistle in the Scottish First Division. His position is either left-back or centre-back. His previous clubs include SC Verl in Germany along with a string of lower league clubs in France, Switzerland and Germany. He signed for Ross County before going on trial at Caley Thistle in May and was offered a permanent contract at the end of the season which he signed on 1 July 2008.[1] On 14 January Djebi-Zadi was told he was free to leave the club on loan,[2] but made his starting debut for Caley on Terry Butcher's first game against Celtic F.C. creating speculation he could be a big player for the rest of the season. He signed a new 1 year contract after impressing Butcher with his performances during the run in to the season. He struggled to hold down a regular place in the side and was released at the end of the 2009-10 season after his contract expired.
