Hasidic New Wave is an American experimental klezmer music group. Its members, all of whom were improvisational jazz musicians from downtown Manhattan, formed for the purpose of fusing Hasidic musical styles (such as freylekhs and horas) with elements of jazz, funk, and avant-garde rock. The band's eclectic style has been compared to Sun Ra and Jimi Hendrix. Band members on their 5 recordings include Greg Wall (tenor saxophone), Frank London (trumpet; also a member of The Klezmatics), David Fiuczynski (guitar), Aaron Alexander (drums and percussion), and Kenny Davis or Fima Ephron (bass). The band has recorded 5 CDs, including four on Knitting Factory's Jewish Alternative Movement label and one on Not Two Records from Poland - a live recording at the Krakw Jewish Music Festival from 1998.
