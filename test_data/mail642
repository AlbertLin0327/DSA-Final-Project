Paras Bir Bikram Shah Dev (born 30 December 1971) was the heir-apparent to the throne of Nepal from 2001 until the monarchy was abolished by the Interim Constituent Assembly in 2008 following Constituent Assembly elections. Paras is the only son of the deposed king and queen of Nepal: Gyanendra and Komal. He has one sister, Prerana. He received his early education at St. Joseph's College in Darjeeling, India, Budhanilkantha School, Kathmandu and Laboratary School, Kathmandu. He later attended Luther College in Iowa[1], and the Schiller International University in the United Kingdom studying for an undergraduate degree in Business Administration. However, he did not complete his undergraduate education.[1] On 1 June 2001, Paras was at the royal palace after the royal massacre, which included the death of King Birendra and most of the Royal Family including the then crown price Dipendra. Paras sustained injuries in the massacre and, according to eye witness accounts, saved the lives of at least three royals, including two children, by pulling a sofa over them.[2][3] Gyanendra, who had held the title of King of Nepal briefly during the 1950s, was again crowned king. Paras, as King Gyanendra's only son, became Crown Prince of Nepal on 26 October 2001.[1] As Crown Prince, Paras was present at Expo 2005 in Aichi, Japan, to celebrate National Day of the Kingdom of Nepal.[4] He made a trip to Austria in March 2006 where he handed over a pair of rhinoceroses to the Vienna Zoo.[5] In July 2007, the Nepalese Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala called for then-King Gyanendra to abdicate the throne and for Paras to renounce his dynastic rights in favour of his son Prince Hridayendra.[6] On 6 September 2007, Paras was rushed to the Military Hospital after he complained of chest pain. Later, at around 11:30am, he was transferred to the Norvic Hospital in Kathmandu. He was operated on for about 50 minutes, apparently to treat a "mild heart attack".[7] Doctors performed a balloon angioplasty on him to clear his blocked artery.[8][9] In 2008, The National Trust for Nature Conservation, which is run by Maoist rebels, published a report alleging that the Royal Family had misused funds belonging to the charity. The trust was formerly run by Crown Prince Paras, with King Gyanendra as its patron. The committee alleged that the Royal Family had spent large amounts of trust funds on themselves over several years to finance trips abroad, lavish parties, and to pay for Queen Komal's health check-ups in the United Kingdom. One highlighted trip was taken by Crown Prince Paras to Austria to donate a pair of one-horned Indian Rhinoceros, an endangered species in Nepal, to a zoo. As the charity is now run by Maoist rebels, the objectivity of the findings has been questioned.[10] Also as a junior Prince, Paras has been a subject of controversy in many events. In the later part of 2010, Paras has been actively interviewing with the media and apologizing in public for his any past deeds that could have hurt the public sentiments. He cited that he was young at that time and just like any other youngster, he may have made some mistakes in his life. He is also viewed as a heavy drinker.[2][11] The prince was accused of reckless driving."[2] In August, 2000, Paras was alleged to have run over and killed Praveen Gurung, a popular singer. A petition campaign was initiated by the All Nepal National Free Students Union, the student wing of Communist Party of Nepal (UML), and was forwarded to the Royal Palace, calling for Paras to be punished. A police investigation ensued, but didn't find the petition claim worthy and was dismissed summarily.[2][12] Recent controversy pro Paras Shah includes illegal possession of the pistol which he fired in the air at a Chitwan hotel on 11 December 2010 under the influence of alcohol.[13] He reportedly opened fire at Rubel Chaudhary alleging that his family members had conspired to abolish Nepal's monarchy and also attempted to defame Nepal and Nepalis during his confrontations with the prince. He was arrested 3 days later[14] for a court trial to be initiated on 19 December.[15][16] However, before the trial began both parties changed their statements agreeing that there were neither any firearms present nor did any firing occur during or after their conversation while drinking.[17] Paras married Himani Rajya Laxmi Devi Shah a member of the Princely family of Sikar on 25 January 2000. They have three children:[1]
