Making his known debut for the Sri Lankan Young Cricketers side (the original name of the Sri Lankan U-19 cricket team), he went on to captain the side on 7 occasions during the 1987/88 Youth World Cup, winning 3 matches but losing 4 and failing to qualify beyond the Group Stage.[1] He went on to play domestic cricket professionally for Nondescripts Cricket Club at both First-class and List A level.
