"(We've Got) Honey Love" is a 1969 single released by Motown girl group Martha and the Vandellas from the album "Ridin' High" released in 1968. The song returned the Vandellas to the top forty of Billboard's R&B singles chart where it peaked at number twenty-seven while it hit the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at number fifty-seven. Like many of their later recordings, most of the background vocals were recorded by Motown session vocal group The Andantes. It was the group's sixth record where they were listed as Martha Reeves and the Vandellas following the successful "Honey Chile" single two years earlier. The song talked of how one woman's lover's charm was like "sugar and spice" adding names of candy and soda adding "a little bit of me, a little bit of you and we've got honey love."
