Igor Pokrajac (born January 2, 1979) is a Croatian mixed martial artist currently signed with the UFC fighting in their light heavyweight division. Pokrajac started his professional MMA career in 2003, primarily competing in his native Croatia. Over the next six years, he compiled an impressive record of 21 wins and 5 losses. Pokrajac has been a training partner of Mirko Filipovi for over the last decade. In August 2009, it was announced he would be joining the Ultimate Fighting Championship, with his first fight at UFC 103.[1] He made his UFC debut against Vladimir Matyushenko and lost by a decisive unanimous decision. Pokrajac next faced James Te-Huna on February 21, 2010 at UFC 110.[2] Pokrajac lost again, this time via third round TKO, due to strikes. This loss was somewhat controversial, as Te Huna had Pokrajac in a modified crucifix position on the mat and landed 5-6 clean shots to Pokrajac's face and although Pokrajac was not able to defend himself from this position, he was signalling to the referee that he was ok, although the ref did not acknowledge this, and stopped the fight after the unanswered shots from Te Huna. Although visibly dazed, Pokrajac disputed the stoppage directly after the fight to no avail. Pokrajac then faced James Irvin on August 1, 2010 at UFC on Versus 2.[3] Midway through the first round, Pokrajac took Irvin down and immediately got side control on the floor. After taking multiple strikes, Irvin rolled over and was submitted by a rear naked choke, handing Pokrajac his first UFC victory. Igor Pokrajac fought Stephan Bonnar on December 4, 2010 at The Ultimate Fighter 12 Finale.[4] Bonnar defeated Pokrajac via unanimous decision (29-26, 29-26, 29-26). Pokrajac defeated Todd Brown on March 3, 2011 at UFC Live: Sanchez vs. Kampmann by TKO at the very end of the first round. Brown was dropped by a knee in the final minute and hit with several clean follow up shots, being saved by the end of the round. When the fighters went back to their corners, Brown was unable to stand on his own power and the fight was stopped.[5] Pokrajac was expected to face Krzysztof Soszynski on June 11, 2011 at UFC 131, replacing an injured Anthony Perosh.[6] However, Pokrajac was himself forced out of the bout with an injury and replaced by returning UFC veteran Mike Massenzio.[7] The Pokrajac/Soszynski bout ultimately took place on December 10, 2011 at UFC 140.[8] Pokrajac defeated Soszynski via first round KO. Pokrajac was expected to face Thiago Silva on May 15, 2012 at UFC on Fuel TV: Korean Zombie vs. Poirier, replacing an injured Brandon Vera.[9] However, Silva was pulled from the bout to face Alexander Gustafsson on April 14, 2012 at UFC on Fuel TV 2 after Gustafsson's original opponent Antnio Rogrio Nogueira pulled out of the bout citing an injury.[10] Pokrajac instead faced Fabio Maldonado at the event.[11] He won the fight via unanimous decision.
