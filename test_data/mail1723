Richard Hills (17 January 1926, USA  15 June 1996, United Kingdom) was the writing partner of Sid Green (24 January 1928  15 March 1999), both of whom wrote extensively for Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise, for their first starring show Two Of A Kind (1961), for ATV and subsequently the first series of The Morecambe & Wise Show (1968) for the BBC. Subsequent series were penned by Eddie Braben, whilst ATV gave Hills and Green their own starring vehicle sketch show, which was unsuccessful. Hills continued to write for light entertainment shows into the 1980s. Hill and Green also created with star Anthony Newley (and wrote) the six-part surreal comedy series The Strange World of Gurney Slade (1960).
