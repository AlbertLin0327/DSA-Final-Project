The Renault 4P, aka Renault Bengali 4, was a series of air-cooled 4-cylinder inverted in-line aero engines designed and built in France from 1927, that produced from 95hp (71kW) to 150hp (110kW). Charles Lindbergh's Atlantic Ocean crossing in 1927 inspired Renault to enter the light aero-engine market to diversify the range of engines they offered. The resulting Renault 4Ps, with 115mm (4.5in) bore and 140mm (5.5in) stroke, delivered 95hp (71kW) and proved popular, later versions powering several record-breaking light aircraft. Developed by Charles-Edmond Serre, by 1931 the 6.3-litre 4Pdi had evolved to give 110hp (82kW) to 120hp (89kW), with the adoption of 120mm (4.7in) bore steel cylinder liners, aluminium alloy cylinder heads attached by long studs to the crankcase, Duralumin connecting rods and magnesium alloy crankcase. In 1946 production of the Renault 4P-01 resumed at the SNECMA factory at Arnage, until 1949, with at least 762 engines manufactured.
