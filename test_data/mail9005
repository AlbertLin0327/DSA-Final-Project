George Friel (1910-1975) was a Scottish writer. He was born in Glasgow as the fourth of seven children, and was educated at St. Mungo's Academy and the University of Glasgow. After a period of service in the army, he spent the rest of his life working as a teacher in Glasgow. The Boy Who Wanted Peace, Mr Alfred M.A. and Grace and Miss Partridge were published in 1999 as The Glasgow Trilogy by Canongate Books. A collection of short stories was published in 1992 by Polygon under the title A friend of humanity and other stories. Friel's fourth novel, Mr Alfred M.A., made it to the "100 Best Scottish Books of all Time" list.[1]
