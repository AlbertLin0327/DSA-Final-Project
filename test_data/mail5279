OSSI-Safenet Security Services is a private military company and a joint venture between US-based Overseas Security & Strategy Information, Inc. and South Africa-based Safenet Security Services. The former is owned by retired CIA special operations officer, John Walbridge, and the latter is owned by retired South African special operations officer, Mauritz Le Roux. OSSI-Safenet is a member of the International Peace Operations Association and Safenet is a member of the Private Security Company Association of Iraq. The company is active with over 500 security personnel in Iraq on a United States Department of Defense. Four OSSI-Safenet staff members were kidnapped in Baghdad in December 2006 while stopped at a roadblock.[1][2] The abductions occurred concurrently with a robbery of a money transport in Baghdad. It is, however, not clear if the two events are linked.
