Sunil Khan, MP, has raised in parliament the question of extending the Bankura Damodar Railway from Beliatore to Durgapur, via Barjora[4] A preliminary engineering-cum-traffic survey was conducted in July 1998 for construction of a new line from Beliatore to Durgapur. As per the survey report, the cost of construction of this 28km long line was assessed as Rs. 90.64 crore at the then price level with a negative rate of return. The proposal could not be considered due to acute constraint of resources and heavy throw-forward of ongoing projects. This information was given by the Minister of State for Railways R. Velu a written reply to a question from Sunil Khan in the Lok Sabha.[5] But Beliatore is well connected to nearby cities and towns through Bus services which include both private and government operators. Beliatore is famous for mecha sandesh, a combination of chhatu, chhana, khoya, sugar and ghee[6] and the art of wooden bead things.[7]
