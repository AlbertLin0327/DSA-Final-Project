Farm to Market Road 1576 marker Highways in Texas Interstate US State (Loops Spurs Rec FM) FM 1576 is a 24-mile farm to market road entirely in Hudspeth County in West Texas. FM 1576 runs from US 62 / US 180 northward before ending at Otero Co. Rd. G005 at the Texas / New Mexico state line.[1][2][3] The FM 1576 designation was originally assigned in 1949 to a short road near Brownsville in Cameron County. This mileage was transferred to SH 4 in 1956. In 1957, part of FM 2249 and FM 2318, to the east of Dell City, were canceled and combined to form FM 1576. In 1960, FM 1576 had the mileage from FM 2636 added to it, and it was extended southward approximately 10.1 miles to US 62 / US 180. In 1973, it was extended to the northeast to its current northern terminus.[1] The entire highway is in Hudspeth County.
