Frank "Pud" Glass (February 10, 1884 - March 2, 1965) was a professional ice hockey player who played in various professional and amateur leagues, including the National Hockey Association and Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association. He was a member of the Wanderers' Stanley Cup champion teams in the 190506, 190607, 190708, 190809 and 190910 seasons. Close-up of bowl portion of Stanley Cup featuring Pud Glass' name Frank Glass was born in Scotland, but raised in Canada. He played hockey in his neighbourhood of Pointe St. Charles in Montreal. His first senior team was the Montreal Wanderers, then an amateur team for the 190405 season. He would play for the Wanderers for seven seasons. In 1906, he became a professional paid player on the Wanderers, one of five out of a roster of nine. He first signed a contract with the Montreal Hockey Club, then chose not to report and signed with the Wanderers instead for more money. His situation caused a problem for the league, which eventually allowed him to play for the Wanderers and fined him $50. A similar situation occurred before the 190708 season and Glass was again fined and threatened with league expulsion if he signed two contracts again. During his time with the Wanderers the Wanderers were the top team in the country, winning league championship and Stanley Cups from 1906 until 1910. In 191112, his final season, he played for the Montreal Canadiens.
