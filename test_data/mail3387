Abuelita is a brand of chocolate tablets, or powdered mix in individual packets, made by Nestl and used to make Mexican-style hot chocolate. It was originally invented in Mexico in 1963. The name is an affectionate Spanish word for "grandma" (literally translated as "little grandmother" or "granny"). Since 1973 the Mexican actress Sara Garca has been the image for the brand before it was acquired by the Swiss company. The chocolate usually comes in hexagonal tablets that can be split into equal wedges, and then melted into milk. The drink can also be mixed with spirits such as Kahla. The chocolate is made of sugar, cocoa and cinnamon. Abuelita has been a staple Mexican product for more than 60 years, and can be identified by its unique taste and packaging. Other "Mexican chocolate" tablet brands are Ibarra and Moctezuma. One suggested method for preparing Abuelita is to bring a saucepan of milk (or water) to a boil, and add the tablet of chocolate and stir continuously with a whisk or molinillo (a whisk-like wooden stirring spoons native to Meso America) until melted and frothy or creamy. The drink is served cool or chilled in preparation for mixing with alcoholic drinks.
