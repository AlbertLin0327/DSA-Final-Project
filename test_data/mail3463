Jason White (born June 5, 1979 in Richmond, Virginia)[1] is an American NASCAR stock car racing driver. He is currently the driver of the No. 23 GunBroker.com Ford F-150 for GB Racing in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, and has been competing in NASCAR since 1999. White began racing go-carts when he was eleven, and has been racing part-time since. Before moving to Busch Series, White dominated the Virginia go-kart circuit. In a five-year stretch, Jason won six Virginia state titles and finished in the World Karting Association top-ten for three different classes of vehicles. White made his first starts in 1999, running the No. 28 for Larry Lockamy. He started 28th and finished 26th in a solid debut at IRP. He was then 43rd after an early crash at Bristol. The runs earned him a spot on Felix Sabates' No. 82 Chevrolet in a fill-in role in 2000. He ran the Channellock Chevrolet at South Boston, putting in his career best of 21st position. Then, he was 28th at Myrtle Beach. White next returned in 2002, running a race at Nashville for Frank Cicci. He finished 43rd at Nashville after an early engine problem. Fred Bickford then picked White up for three races, beginning with a 28th place finish at New Hampshire. His best run came at Nazareth, where he finished 22nd before adding a 37th at Charlotte White's busiest year was 2003, when he earned 29th in points after a splitting rides at Davis Motorsports and Jay Robinson Racing. He ran mainly for JRR early in the year, finishing a best of 23rd at Gateway. Beginning at Nashville in June, White took over the No. 0 Davis Motorsports Chevrolet full-time. He ran solidly in that race, earning his best career finish of 17th. He would record one other top-20 finish at Pikes Peak, trying to do his best with the low-budget team. White was released following the Memphis race in favor of Kertus Davis. White returned to the series in four races in 2004, all for MacDonald Motorsports. After a pair of 33rds and a 42nd at Richmond, White earned his best run of the year at Milwaukee, finishing 29th. It was also the site of his best qualifying effort of the year: 28th. In 2006, Jason White teamed up with the new Ashton Gray Racing. Despite being fast in practice, the team broke before qualifying in the spring Nashville race, meaning the team's debut would come at Nashville in June. He was 36th in that race and 30th at Milwaukee. Then at Gateway Jason finished 41st due to engine problems. Next race is the Emerson Radio 250 at Richmond International Raceway. White's team is expected to make five to seven more starts in 2006. White made his first few starts in the Camping World Truck Series in 2001, racing in seven events. He ran the No. 86 NWTF Ford in six races. His first career start came at Mesa Marin, where he had an impressive sixteenth place run. He then followed that up with a 13th place run at Martinsville, which would end up being his best career finish. He had one other top-20 for the team: an 18th at Pikes Peak. Later in the year, White made a one-race start for Troxell Racing. His run in Kansas resulted in a 36th place finish, the last place truck. White only made two starts in 2002. First, he ran the No. 0 Loni Richardson-owned Chevrolet at Texas, finishing 22nd. Then, he joined the Ware Racing Enterprises team at Kentucky. However, he only managed 34th after electrical problems. White would make two more starts in 2003, running 30th at Dover (running the No. 35 Ford) and 35th at Kansas (running the No. 93 Troxell Racing vehicle). He did not finish either event and would turn to the Nationwide Series for his attention, as he has not raced in the series since. In 2007 Jason was scheduled to run two races with MB Motorsports along with sponsor GunBroker.com, but resulted in a one-race deal at Daytona. In April, it was announced that Jason would run the rest of 2007 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series schedule for the No. 7 Pennington Motorsports Dodge Ram (former Chevrolet Silverado, changed brand mid season 2007) sponsored by Hooters Energy Drink. For 2008, White joined SS-Green Light Racing and brought along GunBroker.com as a sponsor and had a fair, but uneventful season, which placed him in a Toyota for one race. In 2009, Jason signed up with Gunbroker Racing to drive a full-season in the number 23, Gunbroker.com Dodge Ram. Jason scored his season best finish at Kansas in May, placing in the top 10. White also led 86 laps at the O'Reilly 200 at Bristol Motor Speedway but finished 14th after a late pit stop. In September Jason white had his career best qualifying effort and career best finish of 3rd at Las Vagas Motor Speedway. For 2010 White and GunBroker moved to SS-Green Light Racing, where they started off the season on a high note by winning the pole for the NextEra Energy Resources 250 at Daytona International Speedway. White had his best season to date, grabbing 3 top fives and 7 top 10s en route to finishing 10th in points. White and GunBroker.com left SS-Green Light Racing at season's end and moved to the upstart Joe Denette Motorsports. However, Jason and JDM struggled to a 15th place finish in points, and Jason and GunBroker left to form their own team for 2012. On August 7, White made his debut in NASCAR Sprint Cup Series at Pocono Raceway, driving the number 32 for FAS Lane Racing.
