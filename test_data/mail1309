Geoff Clark is a journalist and television presenter. Clark started his broadcasting career as a football reporter with LBC Radio in London in the late 1970s before moving to a studio-based presenter's job there. He then moved to TV-am as an overnight sports producer working 8pm to 8am.[1] He gained promotion to Deputy Sports Editor and presented reports and bulletins on screen before going on to front a live 90 minutes sports programme on Saturday mornings. He also worked with Sky News and Sky Sports before moving into the south east with ITV. He worked there for twelve years, starting as sports presenter then taking over the anchor role of the main news magazine show Meridian Tonight before he moved to the BBC in 2004 as co-anchor of South East Today, alongside Beverley Thompson.[2] He also spent a short spell as a relief presenter for the BBC News Channel during August 2009 and July 2010. BBC South East announced in June 2009 that a reshuffle of regional news in October would result in Geoff leaving the Corporation. He presented his final edition of South East Today earlier than originally planned on 17 September 2009.[3] Geoff returned to the BBC News Channel as a relief presenter in early February 2010. In summer 2010, he also returned to his radio roots, presenting a Sunday afternoon show on BBC Radio Kent. Radio Kent broadcasts from the same Tunbridge Wells site at which Clark was based during his time on South East Today. He also presents the Saturday breakfast show on BBC Sussex.
