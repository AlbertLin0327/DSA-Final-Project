Manius Acilius Glabrio was a consul of the Roman Republic in 191 BC.[1] He came from an illustrious plebeian family (gens) whose members held magistracies throughout the Republic and into the Imperial era.[2] As consul, Glabrio defeated the Seleucid ruler Antiochus the Great at the Battle of Thermopylae, and compelled him to leave Greece. He then turned his attention to the Aetolian League, who had persuaded Antiochus to declare war against Rome, and was only prevented from crushing them by the intercession of Titus Quinctius Flamininus.[2] In 189 BC, Glabrio was a candidate for the censorship, but was opposed by a patrician faction.[3] He was accused by the tribunes of having concealed a portion of the Syrian spoils in his own house; his legate gave evidence against him, and he withdrew his candidature. It is probable that Glabrio was the author of the law which left it to the discretion of the pontiffs to insert or omit the intercalary month of the year; see Roman calendar.[2]
