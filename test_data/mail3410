The Hussian School of Art is a private vocational school for graphic design and commercial illustration located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was established in 1946 and offers a four-year, full-time, program.[1] The Hussian School of Art was founded by John Hussian, a respected and knowledgeable member of Philadelphia's art community and a lecturer at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and taught both commercial art and fine art.[2] At the end of World War II, returning veterans and many civilians were searching for schools to help them build new careers. Because of his reputation and unique knowledge of both Commercial and Fine Arts, the principles of the art museum convinced John Hussian to found this school in 1946. In the early 1960s, at the suggestion of the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Veterans Administration, the school began teaching solely commercial art.[2] The school was incorporated in 1965, and founder Hussian retired in 1973, succeeded by longtime associate Ronald Dove, who remains president as of 2010.[2] Both graphic art and fine art remained an integral part of the curriculum until the early 1960s when, because of its excellent reputation and administrative integrity, the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Veterans Administration suggested the school focus solely on Commercial Art (communication arts). The school was incorporated in 1965 and continued to prosper. John Hussian retired in 1973, turning the leadership over to a long-time associate, Ronald Dove. Since that time, Hussian School of Art has continued to grow and achieve professional recognition. As a nationally accredited career school by ACCSC (Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges), the school is also active in the prestigious ICDS (International Council of Design Schools) as well as the regional professional art community. Since July 2010, Ronald Dove serves as Chairman of Hussian School of Art; turning the role of President over to alumni, Bruce Wartman. Under the direction of Mr. Wartman, Hussian School of Art continues to grow and maintain it's professional instruction in the graphic arts industry. Each faculty member at Hussian School of Art is a working professional in the discipline they teach. So they are not only eminently qualified to give instruction in a specific skill or craft, theyre able to pass on personal experience that no curriculum can hope to cover in such detail. Because classes are small and faculty members have the self discipline borne of working as a successful artist, they know how to focus on the needs of the individual student while maintaining the overall needs of the class. Alumni of the Hussian School of Art include 1950s Marvel Comics artist Joe Maneely, and his classmate George Ward, an artist for periodicals including the Philadelphia Bulletin and the New York Daily News, and a 1950s assistant on Walt Kelly's comic strip Pogo.[3] Coordinates: 395659N 750855W / 39.94971N 75.14851W / 39.94971; -75.14851
