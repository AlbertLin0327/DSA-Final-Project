DU Stadium (sometimes referred to as Hilltop Stadium) was a stadium in Denver, Colorado. Built in 1926, the crescent-shaped main grandstand design was based on other similar-sized stadiums from the same the time period, Brown Stadium and Cornell's Schoellkopf Field. It hosted the University of Denver Pioneers football team until the football program was discontinued in 1961, due to mounting deficits. The stadium held 30,000 people at its peak. The stadium was torn down in the 1970s, and a few remnants remain today. The light towers now stand in working order at Englewood (Colo.) High School's football field, and the old line markers are housed at Penrose Library on the University of Denver campus. DU played its first football game in 1885, and by 1909 had moved to a 10,000 seat grandstand in University Park. By 1924, DU football had outgrown that grandstand, and DU alumni decided to launch an ambitious public bond drive to fund a new stadium. The University broke ground for Hilltop Stadium in March 1925. The construction costs ran just under $751,000, with the project using one million board-feet of lumber, 7,000 cubic feet (200m3) of concrete and 295 tons of steel. The community called the new structure by the nickname Monument to Concrete. The famous sculptor Robert Garrison created two massive figures of athletes, one male and one female, for the Stadiums main entrance as symbols of the value of coeducation and the vitality, the vigor, and the strength of modern American youth. In the venues first official game, DU defeated Colorado School of Mines by a score of 277. However, no regional match-up overshadowed the annual rivalry game between DU and the University of Colorado, Boulder (CU) at Thanksgiving. This tradition came to end when CU joined a different athletic conference in 1948. The facility also hosted other sports during its history including soccer and track and field. The use of Hilltop Stadium extended beyond the realm of athletic competition as well. For example, Charles Lindbergh visited the Denver landmark during a parade held in his honor in 1927. Hilltop Stadium also hosted outdoor theater productions and DU commencement ceremonies for a number of years. Additionally, the Denver Broncos, then in the AFL, played 11 pre-season and 2 early regular season games at the DU stadium in the early and mid-1960s. The University decided to demolish Hilltop Stadium in 1971. The venue had started to crumble, and after the discontinuation of the DU football program in 1961, a costly reconstruction of the main grandstand seemed unwarranted. Although the large crescent-shaped section on the west side was removed, the far smaller section to the east remained until 1974. DU also needed the space for its growing intramural sports program: new plans included ten lighted tennis courts and three regulation-sized playing fields for a wide variety of Today, the Benjamin F. Stapleton, Jr. Tennis Pavilion, CIBER Field at the University of Denver Soccer Stadium, and Peter Barton Lacrosse Stadium, stand on the site of the old Hilltop Stadium.
