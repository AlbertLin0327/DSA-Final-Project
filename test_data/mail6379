Anannya is a women's Bengali-language magazine published fortnightly in Bangladesh since 1987. The magazine has notably championed the role of women in Bangladesh society with its annual awards, which have been given since 1993. Anannya (also spelt 'Ananya') is noted for its annual awards to outstanding women in Bangladesh.[1] Ananya gives its awards to ten women "for their outstanding contribution to their respective organisations"; the 2009 ceremony was attended by Bangladesh's foreign minister.[2] The Anannya magazine awards have been given since 1993.[3]
