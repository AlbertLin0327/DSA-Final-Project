The GE C44-8W is a 4,400 hp (3,273 kW) diesel locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems of Erie, Pennsylvania. Keeping in tradition with GE's locomotive series nicknames beginning with the "Dash 8" of the 1970s, the C44-8W was dubbed the "Dash 8" upon its debut in 1990. The design has since proven popular with North America railroads.
