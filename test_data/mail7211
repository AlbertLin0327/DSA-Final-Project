Motherland is the third studio album from Italian Progressive metal band Daedalus. Roland Grapow (of Helloween and Masterplan) mixed the recordings and played the guitar solo on the song Underground. Nerve Design (previously seen with Threshold, Extrema, Vision Divine, and Sadist) drew the album artwork. Elisa Montaldo (of Il Tempio delle Clessidre) recorded all of the keyboard and synth sections, using her peculiar vintage sounds.[citation needed] Some vocal lines in "Sand" and "Empty Rooms" were recorded by Trevor (of Sadist). All the choir sections were sung by Daedalus. The lyrics analyze from different points of view the uneasiness in todays world.[citation needed]
