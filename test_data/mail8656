Peter Robert Eastoe (born August 2, 1953 in Dordon, Tamworth) is an English former footballer. Eastoe signed schoolboy forms with Wolverhampton Wanderers in the late 1960s. Unable to break into the Wolves first team, the former English youth international joined Swindon Town in March 1974 for a club record fee of 88,000 - after a successful loan spell which saw him average a goal every other game, including a brace on his debut. Though Eastoe's goals were not enough to maintain their Division Two status, in Division Three he notched 31 goals as Swindon challenged for promotion, elevating Eastoe to hero status at the County Ground. The club ultimately fell short of promotion but Eastoe's goals had alerted the attention of the bigger clubs. The striker was signed by Queens Park Rangers in March 1976 for 100,000 (with Don Rogers returning to Swindon as part of the deal). He did not play in the remainder of that season, which saw QPR go close to winning the league championship, but found himself in the team over the next three seasons. He was transferred to Everton in March 1979 - shortly before Rangers dropped out of Division One - in a straight swop for Mickey Walsh. After three full seasons at Goodison Park, he joined West Bromwich Albion in August 1982, where he had a full season in 1982/83. Following this campaign, he was out of the club's plans and spent periods on loan at Leicester City, Huddersfield Town, Walsall and Wolves, respectively. During the twilight of his career he played in the Portuguese league at S.C. Farense and returned to England with non-league Atherstone United. His short managerial career included spells with Nuneaton Borough and Alvechurch but he now works as a lorry driver and lives with his family in Stourbridge.
