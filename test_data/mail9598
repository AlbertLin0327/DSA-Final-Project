Content:
In the 2002 FIFA World Cup the main disciplinary action taken against players came in the form of red and yellow cards. Any player picking up a red card is automatically banned for his country's next game (if it is a serious offense FIFA may extend this ban to a number of games). Players also receive a one game ban if they pick up two yellow cards within the group stage or within the knockout stage.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
