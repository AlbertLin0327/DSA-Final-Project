The Canadian Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of Canada. Published by Billboard magazine, its data are similar to Billboard's U.S.-based Hot 100 in that it compiles Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single's weekly physical and digital sales, as well as airplay. Canada's airplay chart is compiled with information collected from monitoring more than 100 stations that represent rock, country, adult contemporary and contemporary hit radio genres.[1] The online version of the chart features the Canadian flag next to tracks that qualify as Canadian content.[2][3] In 2009, eight acts achieved their first Canadian number-one single either as a lead artist or a featured guest: Kelly Clarkson, Eminem, 50 Cent, Dr. Dre, Kesha, The Black Eyed Peas, David Guetta and Akon. In 2009, 9 singles topped the chart. Although 10 singles claimed the top spot in the 52 issues of the magazine, Lady Gaga's "Poker Face" began its peak position in late 2008, and is thus excluded.[4] Both The Black Eyed Peas and Kesha earned two number-one singles, Kesha one as a feature and one as a lead artist. Three number-one singles tied for the longest-running chart-topping single of 2009, for sixteen weeks: The Black Eyed Peas' "I Gotta Feeling". for nine weeks: Rapper Flo Rida's "Right Round", and The Black Eyed Peas "Boom Boom Pow". Both "Right Round" and "Boom Boom Pow" had non-consecutive runs, while "I Gotta Feeling" had a consecutive run, and broke charts records.[5] Other chart-topping singles from 2009 include Lady Gaga's "Poker Face", which stayed at number one for eight straight weeks, five weeks in 2009 and three weeks in end of 2008. Britney Spears's "3" is noted for its jump from eighty six to first place on the Canadian Hot 100, the largest first place leap since the chart's establishment.[6] David Guetta's "Sexy Bitch" made him the second non-North American and the first French act to reach number-one on the chart.[7] Eminem's "Crack a Bottle" is the first posse cut number one single in the Canadian Hot 100 features Dr. Dre and 50 Cent. The Black Eyed Peas broke the record for having spent the most non-consecutive weeks at number one (25 weeks non-consecutive weeks at the top) with "I Gotta Feeling" the longest-running number-one single of 2009 (sixteen weeks and broke chart records for the longest running single at number one in the Canadian Hot 100), and their first number-one single "Boom Boom Pow", which topped the chart for nine non-consecutive weeks.[8][9]
