Joey Breaker is a 1993 American romance film starring Richard Edson and Cedella Marley. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Erik King also appear in the movie. The movie contains some autobiographical elements of its writer and director Steven Starr.[1] Joey Breaker (Richard Edson) is a successful film agent but misses purpose in life. This changes gradually after he meets waitress and student nurse Cyan Worthington (Cedella Marley) from Jamaica. Eventually he quits his job and follows his heart to the Pacific island-state where Cyan serves the population of her native district as a nurse with an independent practice.
