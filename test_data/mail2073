Jalandhar is a city in Jalandhar District in the state of Punjab, India and municipal corporation in Jalandhar district. It is located 144km northwest of the state capital, Chandigarh. It was known as Prasthala at the time of the Mahabharta and as Jullundur in British India. Jalandhar is another name of Lord Shiva. Jalandhar and Multan are the oldest surviving cities of the Punjab region, with historical references as far back as A.D. 100.[1] The Jalandhar Doab (the region surrounding the city between the Beas and Sutlej rivers) also marked the easternmost territory of the empire of Alexander the Great. He erected giant altars in this area to mark the eastern most extent of his empire and also founded a city named Alexandria in the vicinity and left many Macedonian veterans there.[citation needed] In ancient time, the district or Kingdom of Jalandhar comprised the whole of the Upper Doabas from the Ravi to the Satluj. According to the Padama Purana, as quoted by General Conningham the country takes its name from the great Daitya King Danava Jalandhara the son of the Ganga by Ocean. The whole of Punjab and the area of present Jalandhar District was part of the Indus Valley Civilization. Harappa and Mohenjodaro are the sites where remains of the Indus Valley Civilization have been found extensively. The archaeological exploration made during the recent years have pushed the antiquity of the Jalandhar District of the Harappa period. On the basis of surface exploration, the following new sites have been bought on the Archaeological map of India and the traces of the self-same people as at Harappa and Mohenjodaro have also been detected in Jalandhar District. From the evidence mentioned above, it is established that the whole of the Jalandhar District was a part of the vast areas covered under the Indus Valley Civilization during the early period of history. This civilization developed prior to the Aryan Civilization in this region. The excavations done and the places which is given above in the Jalandhar District have revealed the imprints of Harrapa culture in east Punjab the earlier two important sites i.e. (Harappa and Mohanjodaro) being in Pakistan. Rare and unique archaeological objects have been found in Nagar (Tehsil Phillaur) in Jalandhar District. The earliest known cities in India were in the Valley of the river Indus. The remains of a number of different settlements have been discovered by archaeologists. These are scattered over an area of thousand miles. The two biggest cities were Mohenjodaro and Harappa. These cities were inhabited from 2300 to 1700 BC.
