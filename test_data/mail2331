Vice Admiral Sir John Mennes, also spelled Mennis, (1 March 1599  18 February 1671) was an English naval officer who went on to be Controller of the Navy. He was also considered a wit. His comic and satirical verses written in correspondence with James Smith were published in 1656. Educated at his local grammar school in Sandwich and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, Mennes went to sea and in 1620 saw action off Dominica fighting Spanish warships.[1] In 1628 he was given command of the HMS Adventure and later he commanded the HMS Garland, HMS Red Lion, HMS Vanguard, HMS Convertine, HMS Nonsuch and HMS Victory.[1] In August 1641 he took Queen Henrietta Maria to safety in Hellevoetsluis in the Netherlands and was knighted by King Charles I for doing so and in July 1642 he refused to accept the parliamentary takeover of the fleet.[1] In 1643, once the King had lost the Navy, he transferred to the Army and became a general of artillery and in 1644 he became Governor of North Wales.[1] In 1650 he left England to join the exiled Court abroad.[1] He supported Charles II's ill-fated attempt to retake England the following year. In November 1661, following the restoration of the monarchy, he was appointed Controller of the Navy.[1] Samuel Pepys described him as "ill at ease" in this role.[2] He died in London in 1671 while still in the post of Controller.[1] His poetry was published in a collection entitled Musarum Delici or the Muses's Recreation, in 1656. Mennes's verses appear to have been written for amusement in correspondence with Dr. James Smith, whose replies were also included. Both were light and satirical in tone. The publisher, Henry Herringman, stated that the poems had been collected by him from "Sir John Mennis and Dr. Smith's drolish intercourses." Another anthology called Wit Restored was published in 1658. This contains verse letters from Smith to Mennes, "then commanding a troop of horse against the Scots." Another piece was written to Mennes "on the Surrender of Conway Castle." A satirical poem on John Suckling's feeble military efforts at the Battle of Newburn is attributed to Mennes. Mennes was himself satirised by John Denham, whose poem about Mennes going from Calais to Boulogne to "eat a pig" is mentioned by Samuel Pepys in his diary.[3] According to Thomas Plume Mennes told him that he had once met William Shakespeare's father John Shakespeare, describing him as a "merry cheeked old man" who said of his son that "Will was a good honest fellow, but he durst have cracked a jest with him at any time."[4] As Katherine Duncan-Jones points out, this is impossible, since Mennes was two years old when John Shakespeare died. She thinks Plume may have been recording an anecdote related by Mennis taken from his father.[5] In 1641 he married Jane Liddell.[1]
