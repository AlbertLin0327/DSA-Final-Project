Joseph R. Grodin (born 1930) is a lawyer and former appellate and Supreme Court judge in the state of California.[1][2] Grodin is a graduate from the University of California in Berkeley (1951) and from Yale University (1954). In addition, he has a PhD from the London School of Economics (1960). Upon earning his law degree, he became a partner at the law firm of Brundage Neyhart Grodin & Beeson in 1955. He practiced law there until 1972, when he became a professor at the Hastings College of the Law. He entered public life in 1979 when then-Governor Jerry Brown appointed him to the California Court of Appeals. He served in that position until 1982. when Brown appointed him to the California Supreme Court.[2] On the court, Grodin compiled a solid liberal record, voting mostly with Chief Justice Rose Bird. He was considered supportive of trial lawyers and defense attorneys, while seeming skeptical of law enforcement and business interests. He was opposed to the death penalty.[3] This approach caused controversy, and Bird and Brown had become unpopular with a public which was frustrated with a rising crime wave. In California, state judges are on the ballot for confirmation, with the option of confirming or removing the judge. In 1986, Bird had become highly controversial and unpopular, with politicians denouncing her in their campaigns, including Governor George Deukmejian. Opponents of Bird succeeded in linking Grodin and another justice, Cruz Reynoso, to her. The campaign against them cost $7 million and made the death penalty a central issue. Grodin was rejected by the voters by a 57% to 43% margin.[4] After leaving the court, Grodin returned to the Hastings College of the Law, where he remains today. He has also authored several books.
