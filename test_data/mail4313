Grand Pro Wrestling (formerly Garage Pro Wrestling) or GPW is a British professional wrestling promotion based in the North West of England. The promotion was set up by former British wrestler - "The Middleman" Lee Butler - in February 2003. However, in August 2004, Butler handed over the reins of the promotion to his senior trainees and retired from wrestling due to injury and ill-health. GPW is now run by Johnnie Brannigan and has been since January 2005. However, the name 'Richard Noble' was used as the public facing name up until Brannigan went "public" with his role in the company in April 2012. The promotion runs shows all over the North West of England, mainly in the Greater Manchester area at The Rose Club (formerly known as The Monaco Ballroom) in Hindley Wigan running between 8 and 10 times per year. It has developed a large, passionate fan base and gained a reputation for one of the best story telling wrestling companies in Europe, with second to none character development. Its shows are known for their addictive and progressive story lines mixed with hard hits, high flying, comedy and a very strong connection between their audience and the characters. GPW has established several flagship shows that it has become known for, such as: Crazy Cruiser-8 (one night 8-man tournament show), Only The Strong Survive (survival themed show) A Few Good Men (a Royal Rumble themed show), Friday Night Thriller, promoted as an "unpredictable night of wrestling" and Back With A Bang, the traditional show to start a new year. GPW is credited with having started off many of today's British and American independent wrestlers careers. These names include: Bubblegum, El Ligero, Claudio Castagnoli, Juggernaut, Joey Hayes, "Dangerous" Damon Leigh, Heresy, TJ Cain, Juice, Dylan Roberts, Danny Hope, JC Thunder, Cyanide, Jack Gallagher and many more. The promotion's first show was in July 2003, GPW: "Defection" held at the Monaco Ballroom, Wigan. Wrestlers on that night who are still active on the roster are Heresy, "Dangerous" Damon Leigh and Joey Hayes. Other memorable shows include GPW: "Nemesis" which saw a main event tag team tables match between Lee Butler & Heresy vs. The Young Offenders ("Dangerous" Damon Leigh & Joey Hayes). The match saw both Heresy and Damon Leigh in a 30ft balcony stunt. GPW: "Hold The Line Tour" in March 2004 saw the debuts of Chris Hero and Gangrel. During GPW: "Last Orders At The Legion" in January 2005 there was a well documented riot, at the now demolished venue in Leigh, Greater Manchester. The riots in the audience were very real and occurred when Alex Shane stole the British Title from then champion Damon Leigh. In July 2005, GPW: "Saturday Night Showdown" saw JC Thunder vs. El Ligero in main event hardcore match. The match was quite possibly the most controversial in British wrestling history and resulted in the venue banning all professional wrestling from the Greater Manchester area. GPW followed up its well publicised problems with a show in Preston called GPW: "Trials & Tribulations" in September of the same year. The following year they returned to the Greater Manchester area. In November 2006, Garage Pro Wrestling promoted the first ever Crazy Cruiser-8 tournament. It was May 2007 that GPW promoted Europe's first ever Survivor Series dedicated show. July 2008 saw its 5th Anniversary show GPW: "V". In October 2008, GPW became the only European company to feature a Torneo Cibernetico a match that has gone onto be a staple part of the GPW shows. In August 2010, GPW re-branded as Grand Pro Wrestling. In June 2011 at "Heroes & Villains", GPW presented its 500th match between Zach Diamond and Jack Gallagher for the British Title. In April 2012, GPW wrestler, Dom Travis aka Kastor LeVay died. His last official match was for GPW at "Battlefield" May 2011 but he also made appearances in November (pre-taped videeo) and December 2011 (run-in during Heresy v Voodoo). After 7 years of being known as Garage Pro Wrestling, in August 2010 GPW re-branded as Grand Pro Wrestling and announced an association with Big Bang Entertainment. A new company tag line was also revealed as "Entertainment with a Kick!" Since 2003, GPW has held three 30 men over the top Royal Rumble matches, and one 20 man. Known simply by the company and its fans as "Rumble". As well as acknowledging the eventual winner, GPW also recognise the M.V.P of the match. This is the person who has performed the best by either eliminating the most people, or having out-lasted his or hers peers the longest without actually winning. The Crazy Cruiser-8 is an eight-man one night tournament, and one of the shows GPW has become synonymous with. The eight entrants into the tournament are junior heavyweights or are considered a cruiserweight. Heavyweights are not permitted entry into the tournament. Qualifying matches are contested months prior to the tournament either in traditional one on one matches, 4-ways, 3-ways or in a "Last Chance Saloon Battle Royal". Byes passed the preliminaries have been given in the past to established foreign entrants, eligable reigning Champions and "The Fans Choice". The eventual winner of the tournament would have not only been successful in the preliminaries, but have won three times in a row on the night of the tournament itself. The winner does not defend his title the following year. The first CC-8 tournament was 3 November 2006 and the final 8 men were: The eventual winner was Bubblegum after he defeated Joseph Hayes in the final. The second Crazy Cruiser tournament was known as CC-08 and competed on 2 May 2008. The final 8 men were: Juice was the eventual winner after defeating Chris Echo in the final. The third Crazy Cruiser tournament was competed on 13 November 2009 and saw new rules on qualifying. 2 top seeds were slected as automatic qualifiers (Joey Hayes & Bubblegum). Other qualifiers were decided through a first ever Fan's Choice, a 4-Way Qualifier, The Last Chance Battle Royal and the return of the International Entrant. The final 8 men were: Joey Hayes was the eventual winner after defeating CC8 2008 Champion, Juice in the final.
