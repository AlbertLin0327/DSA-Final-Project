Neptune Island was an island in Long Island Sound and part of the City of New Rochelle, New York.[citation needed] It is now connected to the mainland.[1] In the early 19th century it was called "Moses Island," with the name changed to Neptune later that century.[2] In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the US government rented a dock at Neptune and ran ferries for Fort Slocum.[3] Coordinates: 405325N 734658W / 40.8903775N 73.7829104W / 40.8903775; -73.7829104
