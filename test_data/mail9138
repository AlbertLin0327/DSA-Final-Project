This is a list of episodes of the Japanese anime Our Home's Fox Deity, (, Wagaya no Oinari-sama.?) produced by the animation studio Zexcs. The episodes are directed by Yoshiaki Iwasaki, written by Reiko Yoshida, and feature character designs by Yasunari Nitta, who based the designs on Eiz Hden's original concept. The anime is based on the light novel series of the same name written by Jin Shibamura, and follows the story of Noboru Takagami and his younger brother Tru who get protected by a kitsune and miko from Ykai who are trying to kill the brothers. The episodes began airing on April 6, 2008, and twenty-four episodes are planned for the series. Three pieces of theme music are used for the episodes; one opening theme and two ending themes. The opening theme, "Ki-zu-na: Haruka Naru Mono e" (KI-ZU-NA ?), is performed by Yoshida Hitomi; the first ending theme, "Kaze ga Nanika o I to Shiteiru" (?), is performed by Saori Hayami; the second ending theme, "Shiawase no Kotodama" (?), is performed by Yukana, Saori Hayami, and Mikako Takahashi.
