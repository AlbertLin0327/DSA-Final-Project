Katherine Brionnet (ca. 14941526) was a French noblewoman, daughter of Guillaume Brionnet and wife of Thomas Bohier. She was influential in designing the Chteau de Chenonceau. Her husband had purchased the site which contained the ruins of an earlier fortress as he wished to build a Renaissance chteau there. It was Katherine who supervised the construction work between 1513 and 1521, taking important architectural decisions while her husband was away fighting in the Italian wars.[1] In particular, she oversaw the construction of the practically designed staircase which proceeds straight upwards rather than in a spiral as was usual at the time.[2] In 1524, shortly after the building had been completed, Thomas Bohier died. Katherine died two years later. The initials TBH (Thomas Bohier and Katherine) can still be seen as well as a motto carved on the door: "S'il vient  point" (If it comes to be).[3] The original part of the chteau completed under Katherine Brionnet is known as the Chteau des Dames as it was later extended by Diane de Poitiers and Catherine de Mdicis.[4][5]
