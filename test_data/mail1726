Messier-Bugatti-Dowty is a company involved in the design, development, manufacture and customer support of all types of aircraft landing gear, wheels and brakes and a wholly owned subsidiary of Safran SA. It is the world's largest manufacturer of aircraft landing gear.[4] The company projects are divided into two business units: Airbus & European Programs and Boeing & North American Programs. The origins of the company date back to the formation of a 50/50 joint venture between the France-based Messier and the United Kingdom-based Dowty Group, then owned by TI Group, in 1995. Messier-Dowty was purchased outright by the SNECMA group in 1998. In March 2010, Messier-Dowty opened a new undercarriage components factory in Quertaro, Mexico.[5] In May 2011, Messier-Bugatti-Dowty was formed through the merger of three Safran subsidiaries: Messier-Dowty, Messier-Bugatti and Messier Services.[6] Messier-Bugatti-Dowty has operational sites across the globe. The sites are located in Asia (Singapore, Suzhou), Europe (Vlizy, Bidos, Gloucester), Canada (Toronto, Montreal), Mexico (Quertaro) and United States (Seattle). The main headquarters is located in Vlizy, outside Paris. Each site is responsible for certain aspects of landing gear design, manufacture and support.
