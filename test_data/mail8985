Zenob Glak was an Armenian[1][2] historian of 4th century who became the first abbot of the Glak monastery (also known as Surb Karapet Monastery) in the Taron region of Greater Armenia. He began the chronology that would become the History of Taron of John Mamikonean (10th century, the 35th abbot after Zenob). (ed. Langlois, Venice 1832). Zenob's History is a somewhat legendary account of Gregory the Illuminator, and may have been written in Syriac (according to some sources he has Syrian descent[3]) in the 5th century, though it was Armenized in a later century.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
