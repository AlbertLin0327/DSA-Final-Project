What My Mother Doesn't Know (2001) is a novel in verse by Sonya Sones. The free verse novel follows ninth-grader Sophie Stein as she struggles through the daily grind of being a freshman in high school, her romantic crushes and family life. At the start of the novel, Sophie finds herself dumped by her current boyfriend Lou, then immediately falls into a new relationship with Dylan, a boy considered the height of masculine beauty by her friends. As they date, Sophie discovers she does not really love or even like Dylan all that much and ends their relationship in favor of another boy she meets in an internet chat room, Chaz. Before she meets Chaz in person, Sophie discovers he is a pervert and ends the relationship. Now on her own, she encounters an outcast classmate, Robin Murphy, at the local art museum and is astonished to realize that while he is not physically attractive or liked by her friends, she falls in love with him. The book ends with Sophie choosing to sit with Robin in the cafeteria instead of her friends. The companion book What My Girlfriend Doesn't Know, written from the perspective of Sophie's boyfriend Robin, was published in 2007. Pages Magazine stated the novel "captures the sweet confusion of being a teen girl in love for the first time. And the second. And the third." School Library Journal said "Sones is a bright, perceptive writer who digs deeply into her protagonist's soul... Sones's poems are glimpses through a peephole many teens may be peering through for the first time, unaware that others are seeing virtually the same new, scary, unfamiliar things." The novel appears on the ALAs list of most frequently challenged books in 2004,[1] 2005,[2] and 2011[3]. The most common reason for the basis of the challenges is the poem Ice Capades which describes how Sophie is fascinated by her breasts reaction to a cold window pane[4].
