Livin' Proof is the debut album from Gang Starr affiliates Group Home. The album featured the hit underground single "Supa Star" and featured the acclaimed production work of the legendary DJ Premier. The album is known both for the supposed sub-par rhyming and superior instrumental work. It is widely considered to be Premier's most focused work to date but is often overshadowed by his work with more proficient emcees. Premier produced every song on the album except for "Serious Rap Shit" and "4 Give My Sins," which were produced by Guru and Big Jaz, respectively. "Supa Star" also appeared in the soundtrack of the 2008 video game Grand Theft Auto IV and is prominently featured in the movie Boiler Room. Source: Rap Sample FAQ[3]
