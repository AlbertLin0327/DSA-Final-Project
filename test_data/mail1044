Francis Rodino (born December 18, 1974) is a London-based singer-songwriter. Francis Rodino was born in Manhattan on December 18, 1974. His father is Italian and descends from a long line of Venetian nobility, most notably Enrico Dandolo, Venice's first Doge. His mother is from Romanian descent. Francis has one older sister, Julia. In 1985 the family relocated to Milan, Italy where Francis continued high school and his musical studies, including the cello, at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory of Milan. Francis moved to the UK (London) in 1993 to study Contemporary Media Practice at the University of Westminster. London was where he had his first gigs; at the Cole Shed in Kilburn where he was a regular featured artist. In addition to performing acoustic shows around the UK capital, Francis started working with Alex White, a notable music composer and session pianist (Joan Armatrading), on a variety of soundtracks for advertising, film and TV work. In 2006 he formed the most recent incarnation of his live band, with Allan Burls, Matt George and Nik Hollis - with Luke Juby and Tim Davis joining in 2008.
