The group consist of school friends Jamie Scallion on vocals, Jamie Fisher on guitar, Michael Skorjanec on bass and Keith Wickham on drums.

The band played their first gig in October 2005 at the Dalston Russian Club; the popular website Whisperin' n' Hollerin' gave the gig 10/10.[3] At the end of October 2007, Officer Kicks were signed to independent label We Make Things[4] and on the 23rd June 2008 released their debut album The Six Grand Plot. An early supporter of the band, Noel Gallagher first heard the group after receiving a demo that had been sent to his record label, Big Brother. Two years on he agreed to allow the band to record their debut album at his private studio Wheeler End. Others that have been permitted to record there include Kasabian, The Coral and Paul Weller. The Six Grand Plot garnered many hard copy reviews most notably from the NME, Clash Magazine[5] and Rock Sound. The first single taken from the album was "Pictures of Me" and gained an XFM Radio playlist, Q Magazine's song of the day[6] and the promo video was played on MTV1 and MTV2.[7] In 2008 they played the UK festivals Glastonbury, Secret Garden Party and Bestival as well as touring the UK a total of five times. In 2009, the band began work on their second album at Dean Street Studios in Londons Soho. Citywide Curfew was completed in the summer of the same year.

Many of the songs from Citywide Curfew are regularly used on Sky Sports. The BBC also used Officer Kicks music on the popular TV series Waterloo Road, Ski Sunday and the Winter Olympics. At the end of 2009, the band completed a twelve date national tour supporting The Script in Ireland and a fourteen date UK tour supporting Juliette Lewis.[9] They were also asked to headline the main stage of Secret Garden Party behind Jarvis Cocker. Harley Davidson flew the band out to Austria to play three shows at their bike rally in Faarkesee. Dave Berry from XFM Radio listed the band in his all time top ten bands.[10] Citywide Curfew was released on 12th April 2010. It has a 5/5 rating on iTunes[11] and gained glowing reviews across the board.[12][13][14][15][16] The second single taken from the album "Automatic" was also playlisted on XFM Radio and Ireland's Phantom 105.2; it was also the feature video on the popular website Artrocker.com and used on MTV Cribs. Gordon Smart from The Sun newspaper said the band was one to watch out on Vernon Kaye's BBC Radio 1 radio show. The group was interviewed and performed a session on national radio for the Gethin Jones show on Radio Five live in August 2010. The double A-side single "Hold the Magic"/"2024" was released on the 6th of September. Officer Kicks are said to be taking 2011 off touring to write the third album and concentrate on home life. A new Officer Kicks record is expected in summer 2012.
