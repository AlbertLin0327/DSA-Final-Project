The Asia Pacific Poker Tour (APPT) started in 2007 and is the first major poker tour in this region. Like its counterparts, the European Poker Tour, Latin American Poker Tour, and North American Poker Tour, it is sponsored by PokerStars. The tour was created by President Jeffrey Haas and Director of Marketing Sarne Lightman. Danny McDonagh is the Tournament Director. 441 Productions produce the APPT for television. The first season ran from August to December 2007 with five events held across four locations: Manila (Philippines); Seoul (South Korea); Macau (China); and Sydney (Australia).
