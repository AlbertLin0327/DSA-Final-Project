Philip Francis Little (1824  October 21, 1897) was the first Premier of Newfoundland Colony between 1855 and 1858. He was born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Little studied law there with Charles Young and was admitted to the bar in 1844. He came to Newfoundland in 1846 and articled in law. He got involved in politics only a few years after. He helped lead the charge for responsible government along with John Kent. After it was granted in 1854, he went on to run a successful campaign as Leader of the predominantly Roman Catholic Liberal Party. He became Newfoundland's first Premier in 1855. Little only remained in office until 1858, to be succeededby John Kent. In that time, he managed to secure Newfoundland's autonomy, in making sure Newfoundland had a say over its own destiny. Then Britain and France came with a plan involving the west coast of Newfoundland.[clarification needed] Little objected and in a dispatch in 1857, the British cancelled the deal which would have been unfavourable to Newfoundland. He resigned in 1858 saying "I go now before the milk of Human kindness goes sour for me". He was right in that Newfoundland was about to enter an era of sectarian strife. In 1861, riots broke out over disputed election results from Harbour Grace. Little, who was now Chief Justice, played a prominent role in dispersing and calming the crowds. He later moved to Ireland and did a great deal for the home rule movement there. He died at the age of 73 in 1897 while living in Monkstown, Ireland. He married Mary Jane Holdright in 1864 and they had 13 Children. Their youngest child Patrick Little was a senior Irish Politician.
