The 23rd Ryder Cup Matches were held at the Greenbrier Course of The Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. It was the beginning of a new era for the Ryder Cup. For the first time players from continental Europe took part in the Ryder Cup (specifically, Spanish golfers Seve Ballesteros and Antonio Garrido), to form Team Europe which replaced Team Great Britain and Ireland as the official opposition to the United States. It was hoped that the historic change would help bring about the end of near total domination by the United States that had existed since the end of the Second World War. However the change made no real impact at the first attempt as the United States won the competition easily by a score of 17 to 11 points. The Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. The competition format was similar to the formats used from 1963 through 1975, but with fewer singles matches: With a total of 28 points, 14 points were required to win the Cup. All matches were played to a maximum of 18 holes. Captain: Billy Casper Captain: England John Jacobs On their return to the United Kingdom, Mark James and Ken Brown received the highest fines in professional golf up to this point. James received a 1500 fine for "unprofessional conduct" and Brown was fined 1000 and banned from international duty for 12 months.[2]
