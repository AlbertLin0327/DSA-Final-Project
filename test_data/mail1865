The KiHa 71 series (71?) is a DMU operated by Kyushu Railway Company exclusively on the Yufuin no Mori service in Kyushu, Japan.[1] One 3-car set was introduced on March 11, 1989 and was converted from former KiHa 58 and KiHa 65 DMU cars with new bodies. In April 1990, the train was lengthened to 4 cars with the addition of KiHa 70-2. Source: [2]
