Sky Living Loves was a British television channel owned by British Sky Broadcasting. It launched on 5 July 2010 and closed on 21 February 2012. It was the sister channel of Sky Living and Sky Livingit. On 1 July 2010, a preview for Living Loves replaced Living +2 on Sky and Virgin Media, ahead of the channels launch at 3pm on 5 July.[1] The channel showed drama and comedy programmes that has recently aired on Sky Living, allowing viewers to watch shows again or catch up on series.[2][3] It was announced on 25 October 2010, that Living would be rebranded as Sky Living in early 2011 and move EPG positions on Sky from channel 112 to 107 after Sky1 and before Sky Atlantic.[4] As part of the move, Living Loves was rebranded as Sky Living Loves.[5][6] On 5 September 2011, Sky Living Loves began broadcasting 24 hours a day, up from the previous 3pm to 2am broadcasting hours. In November 2011, it was announced that Sky Living Loves would close on 24 January 2012 as part of a restructure of the Sky-owned channels.[7][8] However, the restructure was delayed until 21 February 2012, with the channel closing at midnight.[9][10] The final programme to air on Sky Living Loves was an episode of Party Wars.
