Bishop Rosecrans High School is a private, Catholic high school, operated by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Columbus, located in Zanesville, Ohio. The school's athletic teams are known as the Bishops. Founded in 1950 as a designed merger of the former St. Thomas Aquinas High School and St. Nicholas High School, the school moved into the structure formerly occupied by St. Nicholas HS. The name was selected to honor the first bishop of Columbus Sylvester Horton Rosecrans and to this day the coats of arms of various Columbus bishops appear on the edifice of the current building. The history of Catholic education in Zanesville traces its history to the year 1830 when St. Thomas Aquinas Parish was established by members of the Order of Preachers (Dominicans). In 1842 St. Nicholas Parish was established by German immigrants and a parish school was also opened. By 1853 the Dominican Sisters of St. Mary of the Springs (Columbus, OH) established a female academy, which would remain open until 1873 when the sisters took over as the teachers and administrators of St. Thomas Parish School. The program at St. Thomas was expanded to include secondary courses between 1884 and 1914. In 1893 the Franciscan Sisters of Christian Charity (Manitowoc, Wisconsin) arrived at St. Nicholas and by 1921 they had also established a complete secondary program. In 1927 St. Nicholas High School built a permanent building, it would be in this building that Bishop Rosecrans High School would be formed and have its first classes. In 1963, after the founding of the new consolidated high school, Albert and Cora Rogge gave money for the Catholic Youth Center which soon became the new home of the high school. Subsequent construction to enlarge the facility occurred in 1970 and 1971, and was dedicated May 23, 1971. At one time, the high school's faculty was simultaneously served by priests of the Columbus Diocese, Dominican priests and brothers, the Manitowoc Franciscans, and the Dominican Sisters of St. Mary of the Springs. Today, the high school has a dedicated lay faculty. Through the generosity of many fine people from both the community and the alumni base, the Bishop Rosecrans Foundation was formed in 1986 to further the mission of Catholic secondary education in the region. For the current academic year the school has 146 students[1] in grades 9-12 and well over 3,300 alumni.[2] Bishop Rosecrans High School serves the academic needs of its students by offering four tracks: General Studies; College Prep; Advanced College Prep; and Honors. Students follow a normal American education preparation and nearly 85% of each graduating class elects to attend a two or four year college both in Ohio and else where. While many of the alumni set off for other areas of the state and country, it is notable that near one-third of the current faculty and staff are themselves members of the alumni. Recent graduates have attended such schools as: and many other fine institutions. Bishop Rosecrans is also very proud of a continual number of students that have volunteered to serve their country in all branches of the United States Military. Bishop Rosecrans offers a wide range of non-athletic extracurricular opportunities including: Key Club, Pep Club, Campus Ministry, Mock Trial, Student Council, Quiz Team, Drama Club, National Honor Society.[3] Currently the school offers its students the option to participate football, soccer (boys and girls), golf (boys and girls), volleyball (girls), and tennis (girls) in the fall; basketball (girls and boys) and swimming (girls and boys) in the winters; and baseball, softball, tennis (boys), and track (boys and girls) in the spring.[4] More information about current Rosecrans Sports can be found at this highschoolsports.net site.[1] The school has achieved Ohio High School Athletic Association State Championships in: [5]
