The Glasgow and West of Scotland Football League was formed in 1898 as one of several supplementary football leagues that operated at the time to give extra fixtures to the various Scottish Football League sides. The league folded in 1906 when the Scottish League's First Division expanded to 18 clubs. The eight original members were Abercorn, Ayr Parkhouse (not a Scottish League side), Kilmarnock, Linthouse, Morton, Partick Thistle, Port Glasgow Athletic and St. Mirren.
