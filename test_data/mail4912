The School of Continuing Education at Columbia University offers thirteen master's degrees, courses for advancement and graduate school preparation, certificate programs, summer courses, high school programs in New York, Barcelona and Jordan, and a program for learning English as a second language. Though the offerings are diverse, the programs are unified by a mission to mount innovative instructional programs unavailable elsewhere at the University that meet Columbias standard of excellence, take good advantage of its resources, and produce positive educational outcomes for the members of the diverse student body. Non-degree programs were originally located in the School of General Studies, but relocated to the Division of Special Programs in 1995, which was renamed again as "the Division of Continuing Education and Special Programs" in 1997. In 2000 the Division began to consider offering degree programs, and was re-organized as the School of Continuing Education in 2002 under its founding dean, Frank Wolf. In 2002 it became both a Faculty and a Department of Instruction in the Arts and Sciences and added its first masters degree program, the M.S in Strategic Communications. In the course of 2002-2006 it expanded its graduate offerings to eight M.S. Programs. It summer high school program expanded to Barcelona, Spain, and a cross-enrollment agreement with Union Theological Seminary were also established in 2002. Today, the school offers thirteen master's degrees, courses for advancement and graduate school prep, certificate programs, summer courses, high school programs in New York, Barcelona and Jordan, and a program for learning English as a second language. The School of Continuing Education offers the following programs: Thirteen applied master of science programs offer training in Actuarial Science, Bioethics, Communications Practice, Construction Administration, Fundraising Management, Information and Digital Resource Management, Landscape Design, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution, Sports Management, Strategic Communications, Sustainability Management and Technology Management.

The Visiting Students Program allows undergraduate, graduate, and high school students with suitable academic records to study at Columbia on a nondegree basis. The Summer Sessions offer a wide variety of undergraduate- and graduate-level courses for Columbia students, visiting students, and new and continuing nondegree students. The High School Programs allow highly motivated students to take intensive noncredit courses for enrichment during the summer. Students may live on campus or commute. The Barcelona Experience is a four-week noncredit study-abroad program for high school juniors and seniors. Culture and History: Understanding the Arab World is a pre-college summer study-abroad program organized in collaboration with King's Academy in Jordan.
