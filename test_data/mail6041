Czech Republic Milan Wognitsch RC Vykov (known as JIMI RC Vykov for sponsorship reasons) is a Czech rugby club in Vykov. They currently play in the KB Extraliga. The club was founded in 1952. They undertook their first overseas tour to France in 1967. The club won their first championship in 1974, beating any 15-0 in the final. This turned out to be the start of a phenomenally successful era for the club, which saw them winning the next seven championship titles. The success of the senior team pretty much filtered through to the youth teams as well in those years. In 1995 the club experienced tragedy when they lost one of their own. Jan Navrtil [1], former international prop and their coach at the time, rescued two men rendered unconscious from a resulting gas leak, while trying to repair some freezing equipment in the cellar of the clubhouse. Navrtil subsequently died from gas poisoning and was posthumously awarded a Fair Play Award by the Czech Olympic Committee. The club also named their home ground in his memory.
