The 2007 Mil Milhas Brasil was the 35th running of the Mil Milhas Brasil (1000 Miles of Brasil) and was the sixth and final round of the 2007 Le Mans Series season. It took place at the Autdromo Jos Carlos Pace, Brazil, on November 10, 2007. It is the first round of the Le Mans Series held outside of Europe, as well as the first event longer than 1000 kilometers. (The LMS did not run an event longer than 1000 kilometers in 2008 and 2009; the 2010 8 Hours of Castellet would become the first event longer than 1000 kilometers since the Mil Milhas Brasil.) Class winners in bold. Cars failing to complete 70% of winner's distance marked as Not Classified (NC).
