Saskatoon City Council is the governing body of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. The council consists of the mayor and ten councillors representing wards. The current council sits between 2009 and 2012. The last civic election was held on October 28, 2009.[1] Historically, the mayor and councillors were elected to three-year terms; however, the terms will increase to four years as of 2012.[2] Don Atchison is a Canadian politician who was elected mayor of Saskatoon on October 22, 2003. Atchison was first elected to Saskatoon's city council as a councillor in 1994 and was re-elected in 1997 & 2000. During his nine years on city council, Atchison sat on many boards and committees, including audit, budget, pension, administration and finance, planning and operations, Prairieland Exhibition, special needs transportation and "The Partnership" (an organization of downtown businesses). Don Atchison is the owner/operator of a longtime mens clothing store in downtown Saskatoon. He and his wife Mardele have five children. He was re-elected as mayor in 2006 and 2009. Darren Hill is the councillor for Ward 1, which is located in Saskatoon's downtown core. He was born in 1968.[3] He is the CEO of Junior Achievement of Saskatchewan and sits on the board of directors.[4][5] Hill was first elected in 2006 and re-elected in 2009. Hill was involved in a dispute during the 2007 provincial election. He removed several signs which criticized the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party that had been put up by a private citizen. Hill believed they violated the city's temporary election sign bylaw, since they were not from any official political party. He returned the signs, which were eventually put back up.[6] Hill wanted the city to amend its election sign bylaw to ban third-party signs, but the city's solicitor reported that the city did not have the legal authority to do so.[7] Hill ran as the Liberal candidate in the district of Saskatoon-Humboldt in the 2011 federal election,[8] but finished a distant third behind Conservative incumbent Brad Trost and the New Democratic Party's (NDP) Denise Kouri.[9] During the campaign, hundreds of his election signs and several of Kouri's were taken.[10] Some were discovered in a dumpster at a construction site.[11] Pat Lorje is the councillor for Ward 2, which is located in the south-west corner of the city. She was the councilor of Ward 2 from 1979-1991. She was then a provincial MLA in the riding of Saskatoon Southeast from 1991-2003. She moved to San Francisco for a couple of years after leaving politics. After moving back to Saskatoon, Lorje was again elected to council in 2006 and re-elected in 2009. Ann Iwanchuk is the councillor for Ward 3, which is in the far south-west side of the city. She was elected to council in a byelection on October 19, 2011. She finished first in a field of six candidates, which included former Ward 3 councillor Rik Steernberg. Iwanchuk is the wife of former Saskatoon Fairview NDP MLA Andy Iwanchuk, whose constituency lay within the ward.[12] The council seat had been vacated unexpectedly when the sitting councillor, Maurice Neault, died of a heart attack on July 13, 2011 at the age of 59.[13] He had been elected to council in 2003, acclaimed in 2006 and re-elected in 2009. Myles Heidt is the councillor in Ward 4, which is on the far west side of the city. He was first elected to city council in 1994, and was re-elected in 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006 by acclamation, and again re-elected in 2009. In 2012, Heidt announced that he would retire at the end of his current term.[14] Randy Donauer was elected as councillor in Ward 5 in a by-election held on November 29, 2010. He won a tight race over the second-place candidate, Ainsley Robertson.[15] He replaced Gordon Wyant, who resigned from council on October 20, 2010, after being elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in a by-election.[16] During the campaign, a Facebook group emerged questioning Donauer's religious beliefs and his church's constitution, which was described as anti-gay.[17] Charlie Clark is the councillor for Ward 6, which is located in the central east side near the South Saskatchewan River, and includes the University of Saskatchewan. He was elected in 2006 and acclaimed in 2009. Mairin Loewen was elected to council on February 9, 2011, in a by-election. She won the seat with about 33% of the vote, defeating favourite Robin Bellamy, a well-known school board trustee.[18][19][20] Loewen replaced Bob Pringle as councillor for Ward 7, who stepped down on December 31, 2010, due to his appointment as Saskatchewan's children's advocate.[21][22] Before her election to city council, Loewen worked for the government of Saskatchewan, as well as being a community activist in Saskatoon and a musician with the local indie rock band Carbon Dating Service. Glen Penner is the councillor for Ward 8, which is near the central east side at the end of the city. He was first elected to city council in 1972, and served until 1976. He then served a term as an MLA. He then served two more multi-term times on council, from 19791982 and 1988-1994. He was then re-elected in 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2009.[23] On April 2, 2012, Penner announced that he will not run for re-election in 2012, and will retire from civic politics when his current term ends. He is the second-longest serving city councillor in Saskatoon's history.[24] Tiffany Paulsen is the councillor for Ward 9, which is in the far south east side of the city.
