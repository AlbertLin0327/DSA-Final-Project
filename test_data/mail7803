In mathematical logic, and more specifically in model theory, an infinite structure (M,<,...) which is totally ordered by < is called an o-minimal structure if and only if every definable subset XM (with parameters taken from M) is a finite union of intervals and points. O-minimality can be regarded as a weak form of quantifier elimination. A structure M is o-minimal if and only if every formula with one free variable and parameters in M is equivalent to a quantifier-free formula involving only the ordering, also with parameters in M. This is analogous to the minimal structures, which are exactly the analogous property down to equality. A theory T is an o-minimal theory if every model of T is o-minimal. Pillay can show that the complete theory T of an o-minimal structure is an o-minimal theory. This result is remarkable because the complete theory of a minimal structure need not be a strongly minimal theory, that is, there may be an elementarily equivalent structure which is not minimal. O-minimal structures can be defined without recourse to model theory. Here we define a structure on a nonempty set M in a set-theoretic manner, as a sequence S=(Sn), n=0,1,2,... such that If M has a dense linear order without endpoints on it, say <, then a structure S on M is called o-minimal if it satisfies the extra axioms The "o" stands for "order", since any o-minimal structure requires an ordering on the underlying set. O-minimal structures originated in model theory and so have a simpler  but equivalent  definition using the language of model theory. Specifically if L is a language including a binary relation <, and (M,<,...) is an L-structure where < is interpreted to satisfy the axioms of a dense linear order,[1] then (M,<,...) is called an o-minimal structure if for any definable set XM there are finitely many intervals I1,...,Ir with endpoints in M{} and a finite set X0 such that Examples of o-minimal theories are: In the first example, the definable sets are the semialgebraic sets. Thus the study of o-minimal structures and theories generalises Real algebraic geometry. A major line of current research is based on discovering expansions of the real ordered field that are o-minimal. Despite the generality of application, one can show a great deal about the geometry of set definable in o-minimal structures. There is a cell decomposition theorem, Whitney and Verdier stratification theorems and a good notion of dimension and Euler characteristic.
