The Knowledge Master Open (commonly known as Knowledge Masters or KMO) is a computer-based semiannual worldwide academic competition in which teams of students from many schools earn points by answering multiple-choice questions quickly and accurately. The questions includes fifteen subject areas: American history, world history, government, recent events, economics & law, geography, literature, English, math, physical science, biology, earth science, health & psychology, fine arts, and useless trivia.[1] The competition started in 1983 with 74 schools. In 2009, there are about 45,000 participants from over 3,000 high schools and middle schools in the U.S. and other countries.[2] There are five levels of competition. 5th and 6th grade contests are held in January and March and consist of one hundred questions. On the other hand, middle school (up to grade 8), junior high (up to grade 9), and high school (up to grade 12) contests are held in December and April and consist of two hundred questions. The Knowledge Masters mascot is a Great Auk[3] with an affinity for puns. All questions are multiple-choice and are worth a maximum of 10 points.[4] Each question is displayed on screen, with five choices and a one-minute timer. Five points are awarded for a correct answer on the first try, with a bonus based on response time. If time expires or an incorrect answer is given, the team is given another minute to respond.[5] Only two points are awarded for correct "second chance" answers. Bonus points awarded for correct first-try answers are as follows: According to the official web site, the following is the list of recent winners:[6]
