Ferrouranium, also called ferro-uranium, is a ferroalloy, an alloy of iron and uranium, after WWII usually depleted uranium. It contains about 3550% uranium and 1.54% carbon.[1] Ferrouranium is used as a deoxidizer (more powerful than ferrovanadium), for denitrogenizing steel, for forming carbides, and as an alloying element. In ferrous alloys, uranium increases the elastic limit and the tensile strength. In high speed steels, it has been used to increase toughness and strength in amounts between 0.055%.[2] Uranium-alloyed steels can be used at very low temperatures; nickel-uranium alloys are resistant to even very aggressive chemicals, including aqua regia.[3] The alloys did not prove to be commercially successful in long run.[4] However, during World War I and afterwards, uranium doped steels were used for tools; large amounts of ferrouranium were produced between 19141916.[5] At least two intermetallic compounds of iron and uranium were identified: U6Fe and UFe2. Small amounts of uranium can drastically lower melting point of iron and vice versa. UFe2 reportedly melts at 1230 C, U6Fe at 805 C; a mixture of these two can have melting point as low as 725 C, a mixture of iron and UFe2 can have melting point of 1055 C.[6] As ferrouranium readily dissolves in mineral acids, its chemical analysis is not problematic.[7]
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
