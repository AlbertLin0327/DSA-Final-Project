Fotopedia is a photo encyclopedia that, as of August 2011, has generated more than 51,000 pages and linked to over 755,000 photos. Fotopedia was launched in June 2009 by 5 former Apple employees: Jean-Marie Hullot, Bertrand Guiheneuf, Manuel Colom, Sbastien Maury and Olivier Gutknecht.[1] Members can create photo-driven articles which include Wikipedia and Google Maps information.[2] They can add a limited number of photos per day resulting in a high quality selection of photos.[3] The range of topics varies widely from precise locations, music bands or species to countries and famous people.[4] As well as taking part in the encyclopedia, professional and amateur photographers on Fotopedia can create albums to display their works, use Wikipedia articles to add context and to advertise popular albums.[5] Fotopedia also has several social networking features, such as a profile page and ability to interact with other users and content.[3] Fotopedia supports Creative Commons licenses, enabling photos to be reused throughout the encyclopedia.[6] Joi Ito, CEO of Creative Commons, is a board member.[5]
