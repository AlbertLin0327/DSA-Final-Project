 The 1989 Yugoslavian motorcycle Grand Prix was the eighth round of the 1989 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season. It took place on the weekend of 9th-11th June, 1989 at the Rijeka circuit. Another pole for Kevin Schwantz, but Wayne Rainey gets a little gap after the light, and is chased by Eddie Lawson, Schwantz, Kevin Magee and Pierfrancesco Chili. Soon, the usual trio develops at the front. Lawson takes the lead, but makes a mistake and goes off-track, letting Schwantz and Rainey through and getting dropped from the leading group, though remaining in the third place. Schwantz wants a win and Rainey wants as many riders between him and Lawson, so Schwantz has to earn the gap he gets from Rainey. Magee and Christian Sarron fight for fourth. Schwantz wins it ahead of Rainey and Lawson, and Rainey pulls ahead slightly in the standings.
