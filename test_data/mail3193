Genevive Fraisse (born October 1948 in Paris) is a French philosopher. She was born within Murs blancs ((French) "White walls"), a community founded by Emmanuel Mounier at Chtenay-Malabry. Her parents, Paul Fraisse (an author of books of experimental psychology) and Simone Fraisse (an author of books on Charles Pguy, Ernest Renan, and Simone Weil), were both professors at the Sorbonne. After May 1968, she helped Jacques Rancire create the journal Les Rvoltes logiques ((French) "Logical revolts"). Author of numerous books, her work focuses on the history of the battle of the sexes from an epistemological and political viewpoint. Her research led her to postulate concepts on the "domestic", "exclusive democracy," "women of reason", the "two governments", the "mixing of the sexes" and, more recently, "consent". The complexity of the debate on gender led her to work closely with the historians, particularly on the synthesis of the history of women in the West. Seen as a leader of contemporary thought, her idea of gender equality lies between theory and practice. Genevive Fraisse has been an interministerial delegate on women's rights from 1997 to 1998 and a Member of European Parliament from 1999 to 2004, as an independent member of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left. She took the initiative of two parliamentary agendas, one on the performing arts, the other on women and sport. Since 2004, Genevive Fraisse has also been a producer at France Culture (Europe ideas). Genevive Fraisse joined the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) in 1983. She helped create the International College of Philosophy (1984). She was Visiting Scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1990. A doctor, she has been director of research at CNRS since 1997 and visiting professor at Rutgers University (USA, 20002002). She was also president of the Scientific Committee of the Institut Emilie du Chtelet from 2006 to 2010. This article was translated from its equivalent in the French Wikipedia on 19 July 2009.
