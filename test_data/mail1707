The Dniepr Balts, a hypothetical subgroup of the Eastern Balts, are Baltic tribes that lived near the Dnieper River in the Bronze Age, and later were assimilated by the Slavs. The Dniepr Balts were studied by the archaeologist Marija Gimbutas, Lithuanian linguist Kazimieras Bga, and by Russian scientists Vladimir Toporov, O.Trubachev, who analysed hydronyms at the higher Dnieper basin. They have found nearly 800 hydronyms of possibly Baltic or Balto-Slavic origin. The river was called Danapir when Gothic tribes lived there and founded Danapirstadir (Danapir city), which later by Slavs was called Kiew, now the city of Kiev.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
