Jakup Xherahu was the mayor of the town of Ishmi, western Albania. Very distinguished, he proclaimed independence from the Ottoman Empire by raising the Albanian flag, just days before Albanian Independence Day on November 28, 1912. A close ally to Abaz Kupi, he helped him escape communist forces during World War II and was subsequently persecuted by the Enver Hoxha regime for that.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
