TVNZ U is an interactive youth orientated television channel, owned and operated by TVNZ. The channel launched March 13, 2011, and features reality programming, as well as an interactive live show and music content. It replaced the now defunct TVNZ 6. Leading up to the launch of TVNZ U, there were 13 days worth of programming information and promotional videos aired to advertise the new channel. TVNZU at first, closed-down at 12am or nearby the time and then on-air playing Goodnight Kiwi. During its closedown period of 12am to 12pm, TVNZ U had on repeat a video of non-stop dancing with a on-repeat sign saying TVNZ U 'returns at midday'. The channel returned at 12pm (midday). From February 2012 the channel began broadcasting informercials from 12am-12pm (Except on Sunday mornings, when it is illegal to broadcast adverts.), During Sunday, the channel will closedown as usual with Infomericals and the 'returns at midday' graphic displays from 6am until 12pm. Thus making TVNZ U a 24 hour channel. In June 2012 on U live the winter special edition with Rose Matafeo, Connor Nestor, Tim Lambourne and Matt Gibb this winter to 4pm - 7pm music, technology artist, film, special guests, giveaways, gaming and more. In preparation of the launch of TVNZ U, TVNZ established a Facebook page for their new channel, giving fans information about TVNZ U and giving one person the chance to schedule a selected segment of programming on the new channel for a month (known as U tv). On the evening of February 28, 2011, TVNZ 6 was officially shut down, allowing TVNZ to air promotional material for the new channel. Since March 6, 2011, these have been videos promoting the new channel. At 3pm on March 9, 2011, TVNZ activated it's U live application on Facebook, which allows users to share in the program U live, which displays a feed of comments and user generated content from said application. TVNZ U was launched on March 13, 2011 at 4:00 pm on Freeview channel 6 and Sky channel 16. The first program to air was U live.[2] The flagship show is U live, a live show airing from 4pm - 7pm daily. The show features music, interviews, and other general interest content. Viewers are invited to participate via a Facebook application, where they can vote in polls, take part in discussions, and view the show via a live commercial and graphic free stream. Comments and polls are then selected and displayed on screen during broadcast. U live is hosted by Rose Matafeo, Connor Nestor, Tim Lambourne and Matt Gibb. U live draws many parallels to TVNZ's rival network Mediaworks' youth-oriented show Four Live, which airs on FOUR. U will have themed programming for the different days of the week, with each theme having a distinctive title. Selected programming available on each night is listed below.[3] Hosted by Julia Hardy is every night at 2pm and 10:30 on video game culture. U TV gives one lucky viewer the chance to schedule a selected segment of programming on the new channel for a month. The viewer will get the chance to programme TVNZ U every Sunday night in their designated month. They will also be given the chance to present links throughout the night's programming.
