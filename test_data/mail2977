Namugongo is the name of a township in Central Uganda. Namugongo is located in Kira Municipality, Wakiso District, Central Uganda, approximately 16 kilometres (9.9mi) northeast of Uganda's capital Kampala.[1] The coordinates of the township are: 00 23 07N; 32 39 05E On 3 June 1886, thirty-two young men, pages of the court of King Mwanga II of Buganda, were burned to death at Namugongo for their refusal to renounce Christianity. Some of the men were of the Anglican faith and others were of the Catholic faith. Annually, on June 03, Christians from all parts of Uganda, East Africa and other parts of the world congregate at Namugongo to commemorate the lives of the Uganda Martyrs and their dedication to their religious beliefs. Crowds have been estimated in hundreds of thousands in some years.[2] Twenty two of the Catholic Martyrs were canonized by Pope Paul VI on October 18, 1964 and are regarded as Saints in the Catholic Church. A Basilica has been built at the spot where the majority of them were burned to death. A church stands at the place where the Anglican martyrs met their death, about 2 miles (3.2km) further east from the Catholic Basilica. Documentation is available on a total of forty five (45) martyrs but it is believed that many more believers met their death at the command of Kabaka Mwanga II between 1885 and 1887. [3] Namugongo is also the location of Uganda Martyrs Senior Secondary School, one of Uganda's leading high schools. The mixed boarding school is a partner with the Stephen Shames Foundation, based in Brooklyn, New York State in the instruction of Information Technology methods and applications to high school students in Uganda.[4] The landmarks at Namugongo or near its boundaries include: Coordinates: 002307N 323905E / 0.38528N 32.65139E / 0.38528; 32.65139
