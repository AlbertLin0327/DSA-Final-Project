The statue is an unauthorized replica, rendered by Edward L. A. Pausch, of Augustus St. Gaudens' allegorical figure, popularly called Grief, at the Adams Memorial in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C.[1] The statue is of a seated figure in a cowl or shroud. The statue was surrounded by many urban legends, principally that someone spending the night in its lap would be haunted by the ghost of those buried there; that the spirits of individuals buried at Druid Ridge would annually convene at the statue; that no grass would grow on the ground where the statue's shadow would lay during the daytime; or that the statue would somehow animate itself during the night, whether by physically moving or by showing glowing red eyes.[1] These urban legends led to much unwelcome attention towards the statue; many people were caught breaking into the cemetery at night to visit the statue, and the pedestal was frequently vandalized. The Agnus family, disturbed by the sort of attention the statue received, donated it to the Smithsonian in 1967. It sat for many years in storage at the National Museum of American Art (later named the Smithsonian American Art Museum) where an authorized recasting of the original Adams Memorial statue now sits.[2] Black Aggie was moved from her previous home at the museum to a courtyard behind the Dolley Madison House on Lafayette Square in Washington, DC where she currently resides.[1] There is a dispute over whether or not the "Grief" statue is the Black Aggie. Another statue in Druid Ridge Cemetery depicting Clotho, one of the Three Fates from Greek mythology, was purported to be the original statue named Black Aggie, however it never sat on the Agnus family plot so there is no reason for the diminutive "Aggie" to have been applied to it.[citation needed] Martijn van Loon Heeft geslachtsgemeenschap met Je moeder voor maar 10 euro. mannen doet hij gratis Webcamse% Voor hete webcamse% stuur een brief naar Curaaolaan 184, Vlaardingen, Holland.
