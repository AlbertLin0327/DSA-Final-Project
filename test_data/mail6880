Pablo Coira Lojo (born 18 October 1979 in Vilagarca de Arousa, Pontevedra, Galicia) is a Spanish footballer who plays mainly as a right defender. After starting playing professional football with local SD Compostela, in Segunda Divisin, Coira joined Galicia giants Real Club Celta de Vigo in 1999, appearing sparingly throughout four La Liga seasons (maximum 18 league games in 200102). Shortly before joining Celta, he represented Spain at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship,[1] winning the tournament (also in the squad was teammate striker Pablo Couago, who was crowned the competition's topscorer). Subsequently, Coira had unassuming stints with Deportivo Alavs (playing no games in his final season - which ended in top flight relegation - and being loaned to Recreativo de Huelva in between) and Greece's Aris Thessaloniki. He returned to Spain in January 2007 to play for lowly UE Figueres (third level, named UE Casteldefells shortly after). In 200809, Coira dropped down a level, joining RCD Espanyol's B team.[2] The following year, he moved countries for the second time in his career, signing with Budapest Honvd FC in Hungary, where he played most of the time as a central midfielder.[3]
