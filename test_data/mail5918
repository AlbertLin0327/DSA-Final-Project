The Krasnoyarsk Railway (  ) is a subsidiary of the Russian Railways headquartered in Krasnoyarsk and serving the south of Siberia. Its mainline is a link in the Trans-Siberian Railway crossing the Krasnoyarsk Krai and Khakassia. It is wedged between the West Siberian Railway (to the west) and East Siberian Railway (to the east). Its length is estimated at 3157,9 km (as of 2009). The original Siberian Railway was opened in 1899, after the completion of the first bridge across the Yenisey. It was extended to Achinsk in 1936 and to Novokuznetsk in 1949. Further expansion occurred in the 1960s in connection with the SayanoShushenskaya Dam project. The century-old Krasnoyarsk Railway Station was renovated in 2004.
