Urban Eye[1] is a London based charity[2] whichhas been regenerating run-down parts of the inner city in London through imaginative design solutions, creative architectural lighting and public art since 1998.The charity has a strong record of forming partnerships with stakeholders (Transport for London, Metronet, Highways Agency, Land Securities and Kensington Housing Trust), public and private organisations (BBC, BT Group), and local authorities (Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster City Council, Suffolk County Council, London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham) to tackle regeneration schemes in run-down sites in the city.[3] Successful projects include transformational works at prominent London locations, including Portobello Road & Ladbroke Grove London Underground bridges,sections of the desolate underside of the Westway (London) [4] and other neglected urban sites such as pedestrian bridges[5] andgraffiti-prone buildings and utilities.[6][7][8] Projects aim to reduce fear of crime and anti-social behaviour and create a more positive identity for an area,[9] providing a lasting legacy for residents and visitors to enjoy. Where possible projects involve local peopledirectlyin the creative process. Projects carried out with schools such as Fox Primary School, resident groups, youth projects, and special needs authorities (The Ashley School) increase ownership and helpgenerate respect for the local environment. In 2008 Urban Eye changed its name from Westway Project.[10]
