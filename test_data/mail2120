Bohdan Paczyski or Bohdan Paczynski (8 February 1940 - 19 April 2007) was a Polish astronomer, a leading scientist in theory of the evolution of stars, accretion discs and gamma ray bursts. Paczyski was born February 8, 1940, in Vilnius, Lithuania to a family of a lawyer and a teacher of Polish literature. In 1945 his family chose to leave for Poland and settled in Krakw, and then in 1949 in Warsaw. Already at the age of 18 Paczyski published his first scientific article in Acta Astronomica. Between 1959 and 1962 he studied astronomy at the University of Warsaw. Two years later he received a doctorate under tutelage of Stefan Piotrowski and Wodzimierz Zonn. In 1962 Paczyski became a member of the Centre of Astronomy of the Polish Academy of Sciences, where he continued to work for nearly 20 years. In 1974 he received habilitation and in 1979 became a professor. Thanks to his works on theoretical astronomy, at the age of 36 he became the youngest member of the Polish Academy of Sciences.[1] In 1981 Paczyski visited United States, where he gave a series of lectures at Caltech to former interns at his Warsaw-based institute. After the introduction of the Martial Law in Poland he decided to stay abroad. He was The Lyman Spitzer Jr. Professor of Astrophysics at Princeton University. Paczyski was the initiator of Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE, led by Andrzej Udalski of Warsaw University Observatory) and All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS, created together with Grzegorz Pojmaski). His new methods of discovering cosmic objects and measuring their mass by using gravitational lenses gained him international recognition, and he is acknowledged for coining the term microlensing. He was also an early proponent of the idea that gamma-ray bursts are at cosmological distances. His research concentrated on stellar evolution, gravitational lensing and gravitational microlensing, variable stars, gamma-ray bursts, and galactic structure. In 1999, he became the first astronomer to receive all three major awards of the Royal Astronomical Society, by winning the Gold Medal, having won the Eddington Medal in 1987 and the George Darwin Lectureship in 1995.[2] He was honoured with the title of doctor honoris causa by Wrocaw University in Poland (on June 29, 2005) and Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru in Poland (on September 22, 2006). In January 2006 he was awarded Henry Norris Russell Lectureship of the American Astronomical Society, "for his highly original contributions to a wide variety of fields including advanced stellar evolution, the nature of gamma ray bursts, accretion in binary systems, gravitational lensing, and cosmology. His research has been distinguished by its creativity and breadth, as well as the stimulus it has provided to highly productive observational investigations". He died of brain cancer on April 19, 2007 in Princeton, New Jersey.[3] Awards Named after him
