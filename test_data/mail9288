Forkhead box protein H1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the FOXH1 gene.[1][2] FOXH1 encodes a human homolog of Xenopus forkhead activin signal transducer-1. FOXH1 protein binds SMAD2 and activates an activin response element via binding the DNA motif TGT(G/T)(T/G)ATT.[2] FOXH1 has been shown to interact with DRAP1[3] and Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2.[4][5][6][7][8] This article incorporates text from the United States National Library of Medicine, which is in the public domain.
