Camp Lapwai was established by Company E, 1st Regiment Washington Territory Volunteer Infantry when after being mustered in at Alcatraz, they were ordered on October 19, 1862 to Camp Lapwai near the Nez Perce Agency.[1] Joined there at the beginning of November by Company "F", 1st Oregon Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, they built their encampment, Camp Lapwai (that was later renamed Fort Lapwai in 1863), in what would become Idaho Territory when it was created the following March.
