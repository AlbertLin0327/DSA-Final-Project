The Seychelles giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys hololissa) has been thought to be extinct since the mid-19th century due to overexploitation on the granitic Seychelles islands. Similar giant tortoise species on other Indian Ocean islands such as Mauritius, Runion and Rodrigues Island are also extinct. The only species of Indian Ocean giant tortoise to avoid this fate was the Aldabra giant tortoise due to its isolated location and 19th century conservation efforts. This species inhabited islands of the Seychelles group, where it thrived on vegetation on the edges of marshes and streams. By 1840, it had disappeared from the wild and was assumed to be extinct. As a grazing species, it somewhat resembled the Aldabra tortoise with its domed shape. In 1999, some Seychelles island tortoises (12 known individuals) were suggested to have survived in captivity. The report of oddly-shaped captive tortoises prompted the Nature Protection Trust of Seychelles to examine the identity of the living tortoises. Examination of museum specimens of the "extinct" Seychelles species by Dr. Justin Gerlach and Laura Canning seemed to show some living tortoises possess characteristics of the extinct species. However, a recently published scientific paper on the genetics of the rediscovered Seychelles and Indian Ocean tortoises showed that they were not distinct from the Aldabra giant tortoises.[1] A 181-year old tortoise on Saint Helena, named Jonathan, is believed to be a survivor of the species (as well as being potentially the oldest living tortoise in the world presently).[2]
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
