J. Malcolm Fawcett( ) was an English? entomologist who specialised in Lepidoptera. His collection of African moths was acquired by Walter Rothschild for his museum at Tring and are now in the Natural History Museum in London. His butterflies were sold by auction. Fawcett's Clouded Yellow is named for him.
