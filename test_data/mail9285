Carrick (also known as Carrick Borough) was a constituency represented in the Irish House of Commons from 1614 to 1800. It returned two members. This constituency was the borough of Carrick-on-Shannon in County Leitrim. In the Patriot Parliament of 1689 summoned by King James II, Carrick was not represented.[1] Under the terms of the Act of Union 1800, the constituency was disenfranchised and abolished.
