Barry Kip Averitt (born 31 October 1954)[1] is a former Republican member of the Texas Senate representing the 22nd District, which includes Ellis and McLennan counites. He was renominated in the primary election held on March 2, 2010, having polled 37,682 votes (60.1 percent) to his intraparty rival, Darren Yancy, who received 25,028 ballots (39.9 percent).[2] His Senate biography indicates that he was born in West Texas in Crane in Crane County, near Odessa, Texas. Rootsweb.com gives his birthplace as Ector County, of which Odessa is the seat of government. It is probable therefore that his parents were living in Crane at the time of his birth and that he was born in a hospital in Odessa. Averitt is a graduate of Baptist-affiliated Baylor University in Waco, where he now resides. Averitt's native Crane County is named for William Carey Crane, a former president of Baylor. Averitt inserted language into HB 2649 outlawing the profession of theatrical or architectural lighting designer unless licensed as an engineer, electrician, architect, or interior designer.[3] Averitt stepped down from his seat on March 8, 2010, citing health problems.[4] In the June 22, 2010, special election, to complete Averitt's current term, fellow Republican conservative Brian Birdwell of Granbury defeated Averitt's predecessor in the post, David Sibley of Waco, also a Republican. Birdwell led by some four thousand votes. Sibley was enorsed by former U.S. President George W. Bush, a resident of the senatorial district, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples, and U.S. Representative Joe Barton. Birdwell, meanwhile, is unopposed in the November 2 general election because his Democratic opponent withdrew from the race in September. Senate election history of Averitt.[5]
