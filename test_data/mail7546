Grebo is a Kru language of Liberia. All of the Grebo languages commonly go by the term Grebo, though in Ivory Coast Krumen is usual. Grebo country is in the extreme south-west of Liberia on the coast and inland, between the rivers Cavally and Cess [1]. As in other Kru languages, tone is extremely important. For instance, ne, with tone 1/2 (that is, either a high tone or a high-mid tone out of the range high, high-mid, low-mid and low) is the first-person pronoun "I", while ne with tone 4 (that is, the low tone) is "you" when addressing one person.[2]
