Cloudworks Energy Inc. is a private, Vancouver-based run-of-river hydro developer formed in 1999. The firm's principals developed the 33MW Miller Creek run-of-river project (subsequently sold to Capital Power Corporation) and the 49.9MW Rutherford Creek project (subsequently sold to Innergex Renewable Energy). Cloudworks claims that its management is "an experienced team with decades of experience in run of river development."[1][2] With 145MW of operational projects,[3] Cloudworks was British Columbias leading independent hydro power producer before Plutonic Power commissioned its 196MW East Toba and Montrose project in August 2010. The firm has been awarded multiple Power Purchase Agreements in both BC Hydro's 2006 and 2008 power calls, which will provide opportunities for future growth in its home province. British Columbia's Environmental Assessment office certified this project in September 2006 and BC Hydro awarded it a power purchase agreement in that year's Open Call for Power. The overall Kwalsa Energy project is composed of four separate facilities on the following creeks: Douglas, Fire, Stokke and Tipella. Estimated capital costs of $263m were partially offset by the Government of Canada's $10/MWh ecoENERGY production credit, which will contribute up to $35m over 10 years.Cloudworks signed a development agreement with the Douglas First Nation, which had been reliant upon diesel generators until this project became operational in late-2009. Like Kwalsa Energy, this project received a Power Purchase Agreement from BC Hydro in the 2006 Open Call for Power and its revenues are supplimented by the ecoENERGY production credit. Its facilities are located on the Upper Stave River and Lamont Creek. Cloudworks Energy was one of the most successful bidders in BC Hydro's 2008 Call for Power, receiving three Power Purchase Agreements.[4] Cloudworks expects construction to begin in Spring 2011 and for the project to be operational in Fall 2013. Cloudworks expects construction to being in Spring 2013 and the facility to be operational in Fall 2016. Cloudworks expects construction to being in Spring 2013 and the facility to be operational in Fall 2016. As of October 2010, Cloudwoks had no plans be begin construction on this project, which is to be located on the site of an 80-year-old traditional hydro dam near Chehalis, between Harrison and Stave Lake. In the 2008 Call for Power, Cloudworks submitted proposals for two projects located near Campbell River. Neither of these projects was awarded a Power Purchase Agreement.[9]
