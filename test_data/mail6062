Edward Barry (18521927) was an Irish nationalist politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for South Cork from 1892 to 1910. Barry was elected to the United Kingdom House of Commons at the 1892 general election as an Anti-Parnellite candidate, and rejoined the Irish Parliamentary Party when the split was resolved in early 1900. He held his seat until the general election in December 1910.
