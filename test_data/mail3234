Guy Benson (born March 7, 1985) is a conservative talk radio personality and blogger. He is the political editor of Townhall.com in Washington, D.C.[1] and hosts his own Sunday night program, The Guy Benson Show, on AM 560 WIND in Chicago. He previously produced The Sandy Rios Show on WYLL, a sister station, from 2008 to 2010. Benson also contributes to Andrew Breitbart's "Big" sites and National Review Online's Media Blog, while also appearing regularly on The Hugh Hewitt Show (which he also guest hosts).[2] Benson lived much of his early life overseas before settling down in Ridgewood, New Jersey.[3] During high school, he spent most of his time broadcasting sports on local television. He also interned for two summers at Fox News, working primarily with Hannity & Colmes, before assisting the channel with its coverage of the 2004 Republican National Convention.[4] Benson graduated from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University in 2007. While at Northwestern, he worked for the campus radio station, WNUR, broadcasting sporting events and hosting a political talk show. Benson also reported for an NPR station in South Florida, broadcast summer baseball games in the Cape Cod Baseball League,[5] and interned at the White House. In April 2008, Benson discovered video[6] from a 2007 reunion of the Weathermen, a radical left wing group from the 1960s and 70s. The footage included quotes from two members, Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn, defending their unlawful actions. Since Barack Obama was criticized during the 2008 presidential campaign for associating with Ayers and Dohrn, the clips made national news, from the Boston Globe[7] to Fox News. Benson garnered national attention during the 2008 Presidential Race on two other occasions. In August, after the Obama campaign attacked WGN Radio in Chicago for allowing Stanley Kurtz to appear on their station, Benson - who was in studio during the interview - detailed his experience.[8] Then, two weeks before Election Day, Benson joined with Mary Katharine Ham and Ed Morrissey to pen "The Comprehensive Argument Against Barack Obama," released on Hot Air.[9] The detailed post featured numerous video clips of Obama and was linked across the internet in a matter of hours.
