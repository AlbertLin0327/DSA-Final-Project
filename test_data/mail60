"Alles was war" (All that was) is a song by Die Toten Hosen. It's the second single and the eighth track from the album In aller Stille. The release was initially planned for February 27th, but moved to February 20. This song was chosen for the second single, because it became clear on the machmalauter-tour, that this is one of the fan favourites.[1] The song is a generally a hymn about nostalgia and how one shouldn't regret what has been done and what hasn't been. It peaked at #9 at the German Single Charts. The video premiered on Sevenload.com on February 6. It features touring footage - concerts, bus rides, preparing the stage etc.
