It is formally derived from imidazole through replacement of the hydrogen in position 4 by a methyl group. It is a slightly yellowish solid with density 1.02 g/cm3, melting point 46-48 C, boiling point 263 C and flash point 157 C. 4-Methylimidazole may be formed in the browning of certain foods through the Maillard reaction between carbohydrates and amino-containing compounds. In particular, it is found in roasted foods, grilled meats, coffee and in types of caramel coloring produced with ammonia-based processes.[1][2] It may arise also by fermentation. 4-Methylimidazole may be prepared using the Debus-Radziszewski imidazole synthesis, by reacting methylglyoxal with ammonia and formaldehyde.[3] It may also be prepared by the reaction of hydroxyacetone and formamide in ammonia.[4] There has been concern about the presence of 4-MEI in caramel color (which is the most used food and beverage coloring), typically at a concentration between 50 and 700 ppm.[5] Dark beers and common brands of cola drinks may contain more than 100 g of this compound per 12-ounce serving.[1] At very high doses (360 mg/kg of body weight), 4-methylimidazole is a convulsant for rabbits, mice and chicks, and was the likely cause of acute intoxication observed in cattle fed with ammoniated sugar-containing cattle feed supplements in the 1960s.[5] On the other hand, several studies found no ill effect in rats and dogs for the concentrations found in caramel coloring.[5] A study even found that 4-MEI had an anti-carcinogenic effect on rats.[1][6] Based on these studies, caramel coloring of all types are considered safe. In the European Union the legal limit for 4-MEI in caramel coloring is 250mg/kg.[7] However, a 2007 study by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) found that high doses of 4-MEI were carcinogenic in mice and in female rats.[8] Similar effects were observed for the isomer 2-methylimidazole, also found in caramel coloring. It also has been claimed that the reduction in tumor rates seen by Chan and others were due to lower body weight rather than a true anti-carcinogenic effect.[1] In January 2011 California added 4-MEI to its list of probable carcinogens and stipulated 16 g per day as the "No Significant Risk Level" intake. This is considerably less than the mean intake of 4-MEI by regular cola drinkers.[1] The food industry has strongly opposed that decision, as it implies the need for additional warning labels on many products, and it disputes the validity of the NTP study.[1] In March 2012 it was announced that both Coca-Cola and Pepsi have had their caramel color suppliers modify their manufacturing processes in order to meet the new California standard; as of the announcement the changes had already been made for beverages sold in California.[9] The recipe is not changing in Europe, so the 4-MEI level will remain the same.[10][11]
