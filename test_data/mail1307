The 192021 Hamilton Tigers season was the first season of play for the new Hamilton Tigers team in the National Hockey League (NHL). The Tigers finished in last place in both halves of the season and did not qualify for the playoffs. The NHL transferred the Bulldogs franchise to Hamilton, where it was named the Tigers, after the amateur team. Noting that the Bulldogs finished in last place in 191920, the league encouraged the other teams to provide players to Hamilton to improve the team's competitiveness. Toronto provided Babe Dye but recalled Dye after the first game and loaned Mickey Roach. Montreal provided Billy Coutu in exchange for keeping Harry Mummery. Ottawa did not provide any players willingly. Sprague Cleghorn and Harry Broadbent were eventually ordered by the league to report to Hamilton, but neither did. Cleghorn played some games with Toronto before returning to Ottawa.[1] After four games Joe Malone, formerly of Quebec, arrived. He scored 28 goals in 20 games for the Tigers to place fourth in the league. in goal-scoring.[2] However, the team won only three games in each half of the schedule to finish last.
