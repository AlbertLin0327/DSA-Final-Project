Sir Philip Sidney Stott, 1st Baronet (20 February 185831 March 1937), usually known as Sidney Stott until 1920, was an English architect, civil engineer and surveyor. Stott was born in Chadderton, Lancashire, the third son of Abraham Henthorn Stott.[1] He was educated at Oldham High School and then joined the family firm, which had offices in Oldham and Manchester. In 1883 he set up his own business, P. S. Stott, specialising in the design of cotton mills.[2] Many of his designs were erected in Lancashire and across the world, especially in India and the Far East. He benefited by the innovations made both by his father and Edward Potts, another Oldham architect. His first mill design was for Chadderton Mill in 1885. Sidney Stott designed 22 mills in Oldham and 55 elsewhere in Lancashire. His last design was the Maple No 2 in 1915. His work accounted for 44% of the increase in the spinning capacity of the county between 1887 and 1925, and for 40% of the new spindles laid down in Oldham between 1887 and 1914. His mills created 9 million spindles He relied on the triple brick arches supported on steel beams favoured by George Stott, rather than concrete.[3] However, his wealth came from the shares that he took out in the mills he was designing rather than his professional fees. Many of his designs were also erected across the world, especially in India and the Far East. Stott was a freemason. He was also president of the Oldham Lyceum and played rugby for Oldham Football Club. He held several directorships in the Lancashire cotton spinning industry. He moved to Stanton Court, Gloucestershire (near Broadway, Worcestershire) in 1913 and began to devote much of his time to the Conservative Party and to the protection of the countryside. He was created a baronet in the 1920 Birthday Honours. He became a Justice of the Peace and, in 1925, High Sheriff of Gloucestershire. In 1923 he presented Overtone Park, Northamptonshire, to the Conservative Party to be used as a training college for speakers and election agents. It was named the Philip Stott College. However, it closed in 1929 and its work was transferred to the Bonar Law College. Stott claimed that it had never been given enough support and in May 1935 resigned from the presidency of the Cirencester-Tewkesbury Conservative and Unionist Association, citing differences with the party leadership over Indian policy. He died in 1937. Joseph Stott, Heywood and Ogden (1894-1895) Joseph Stott and Son (George Stott, 1896-1936) [1]
