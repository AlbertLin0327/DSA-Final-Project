Major League Baseball on TSN is a television presentation of Major League Baseball games on Canada's TSN (The Sports Network). TSN has broadcast Major League Baseball games since they went on the air in 1984. Their current MLB schedule consists of simulcasting ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball broadcasts on TSN2 [1]. TSN had previously broadcast Sunday Night Baseball from 1990-2000. TSN has also broadcast Toronto Blue Jays (1984-2009) and Montreal Expos (1985-1999; 2001) games. Toronto Blue Jays baseball aired on TSN from September 1, 1984 until September 23, 2009. When The Sports Network launched in 1984, the first program to air was a Minnesota Twins - Toronto Blue Jays game. In 1985, TSN became the majority broadcaster of Toronto Blue Jays games, a position which they would hold till the 2002 season. From 1993-2000, Baseball Tonight, a pregame show hosted by former Blue Jay Pat Tabler preceded the game, with TSN Sportsdesk following it. As previously mentioned, the last game aired on September 23, 2009, as Rogers Sportsnet acquired the complete rights for the 2010 season. Blue Jays broadcasts were sponsored by Labatt from 1984-2000 and by Rogers from 2001-2009. Labatt also sponsored TSN's Expos broadcasts.
