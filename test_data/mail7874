The Colegio Mayor de Santiago, el Zebedeo, Colegio del Arzobispo or Colegio Mayor de Fonseca is a historical edifice in Salamanca, Spain, founded in 1519 by Alonso de Fonseca, archbishop of Santiago de Compostela (hence its name), in order to provide Galician students with a college in which to study within the University of Salamanca. It is one of the Colegios Mayores of Salamanca and was later known as the Colegio de los Irlandeses or the Irish College. Coordinates: 405756N 54013W / 40.96556N 5.67028W / 40.96556; -5.67028
