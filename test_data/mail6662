KLCI (106.1 FM, "Bob 106") is a radio station serving the northwest Twin Cities area of Minnesota, United States, that airs a country music format. They are licensed to suburban Elk River, Minnesota and serve the Twin Cities as a rimshot signal. Bob 106's transmitter is in Albertville, Minnesota. KLCI's playlist focuses on a variety of country music. The station has a playlist of country from the 60's through the best of today, with some music from the 50's as well. KLCI adopted the slogan "Minnesota's TOTAL Country" to promote this. In 2006, KLCI became the new radio flagship of Minnesota Timberwolves and Minnesota Lynx basketball. KLCI is no longer the radio flagship for the Timberwolves starting the 2008-09 season. The station's moniker, "BOB 106.1," came from a former Twin Cities country station, BOB 100, which changed formats in 1997 to an all Rock Format with Howard Stern in the Morning. KLCI picked up the nickname and referred to themselves as "The New BOB." The station was previously known as WQPM-FM, with the same country format. In 2007, BOB 106 signed long-time Twin Cities morning duo Chuck & Jon (Chuck Knapp & Jon Engen) who had been the #2 morning show in the Twin Cities area while working at KTIS-FM. KLCI has a sister station, KDDG FM 105.5 in Albany, MN. BOB 106 has an agreement with WCCO radio, If Gophers are on same time as Minnesota wild then BOB 106 gets to air the Wild games.
