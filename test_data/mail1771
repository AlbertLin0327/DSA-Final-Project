CFRG-FM is a French language radio station that operates at 93.1 FM in Gravelbourg, Saskatchewan. It retains the call sign formerly used by CFRG, a now-defunct private affiliate of Radio-Canada which aired in Gravelbourg from 1952 to 1975. The station was licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in 2003.[1]
