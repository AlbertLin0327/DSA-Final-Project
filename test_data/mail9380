Charles H. Ludington, brother four sisters James Ludington (April 18, 1827  April 1, 1891) was an American entrepreneur.[1][2] When Ludington was sixteen in 1843, the family moved from New York to Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[1] With his father, Lewis Ludington, they founded Columbus, Wisconsin in 1845.[1][3] On October 11, 1854 Ludington loaned funds to George W. Ford for a sawmill operation in what was then known as the village of Pere Marquette in the northwestern part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan.[1][2][4] Ford defaulted on the loan and became insolvent in 1859.[1][2][4] Ludington then took over the operations of this sawmill.[1][2][4] The post office for the village was established in 1864 in Ludington's original store at this sawmill.[2][4] A boarding house called the Filer House was constructed in 1866 to house the employees of Ludington's sawmill.[1][2] Ludington platted the village of Pere Marquette in 1867.[1][2][4] In the same year Ludington built a large commercial building that sold a variety of goods called The Big Store.[1][2] Ludington founded the first newspaper of the village called the Mason County Record in 1867.[1][2][4] The sawmill that Ludington acquired had developed into an independent entity called the Pere Marquette Lumber Company that was the operator and management of the sawmill and The Big Store.[1][2] Ludington sold his interests to them in 1869 for half a million dollars - making him a very wealthy person.[1][2] Ludington used a portion of this money to develop the village. On March 22, 1873, the city of "Ludington" was chartered.[1][2] The streets of Ludington Ave and James Street are named after him.[2] The village city streets of Lewis, William, Robert, Charles, Harrison, Emily, Lavina, and Delia are named after his family members.[2] Ludington lived in the state of New York as a boy and in the state of Wisconsin as an adult.[1][3] He never lived in Ludington, Michigan - the town that bears his name.[5][6] At one time or another Ludington held the following positions. According to the Ludington Daily News the descendents of Ludington have a family reunion about once every three years in the town of Ludington consisting of some 50 to 75 people. According to this newspaper article James Ludington is a descendent of William Luddington (with two "ds"), who arrived in Massachusetts in 1637 from England. Ron Ludington is the grandson of William and the family genealogist who wrote the newspaper article. He says in the article that the branch of Luddingtons still in England spells the name with two "ds." The name was apparently changed to one "d" when Col. Henry Ludington of the American Revolution married his first cousin and had it changed to avoid confusion in the family. A past prominent family member is Sybil Ludington, an American Revolutionary War herione that rode her horse at night to alert the American forces of an eminent attack by the British, much like that done by Paul Revere. Ron points out that the family members come from all parts of the United States and Canada, as well as from England. Their relationship to each other has been confirmed by DNA testing.[7] There is a complete genealogy family history at Google Books of the Ludingtons in a memoir of Colonel Henry Ludington, printed by his grandchildren L.E. Ludington and C.H. Ludington in 1907.[3]
