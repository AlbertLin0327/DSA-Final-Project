 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (Krasuang Borathet) is the government ministry responsible for representing Cambodia to the international community. The ministry oversees the foreign relations of Cambodia, maintains diplomatic missions in other countries, and provides visa services. The current minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation is H.E. Mr. Hor Namhong. The ministry offices are located in Phnom Penh. Presently e-Visa system has been launched by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, which enables you to apply for a Cambodia tourist visa online. Instead of applying through Cambodian Embassy, all you need to do is to complete the online application form and pay with your credit card. After receiving your Visa through email, print it out and bring it along when you travel to Cambodia. Tourists can apply for online visa to Cambodia at the official website http://www.mfaic.gov.kh/evisa
