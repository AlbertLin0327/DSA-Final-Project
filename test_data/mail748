Borage, (Borago officinalis), also known as a starflower, is an annual herb originating in Syria,[1] but naturalized throughout the Mediterranean region, as well as Asia Minor, Europe, North Africa, and South America. This plant was thought to be native of Assyria, but is probably of North African origin, where there are other Borago species. It grows to a height of 60100 cm (2.03.3 ft), and is bristly or hairy all over the stems and leaves; the leaves are alternate, simple, and 515 cm (2.05.9 in) long. The flowers are complete, perfect with five narrow, triangular-pointed petals. Flowers are most often blue in color, although pink flowers are sometimes observed. White flowered types are also cultivated. The blue flower is genetically dominant over the white flower. [2] The flowers arise along scorpioid cymes to form large floral displays with multiple flowers blooming simultaneously, suggesting that borage has a high degree of geitonogamy[3]. It has an indeterminate growth habit which may lead to prolific spreading. In milder climates, borage will bloom continuously for most of the year. Traditionally borage was cultivated for culinary and medicinal uses, although today commercial cultivation is mainly as an oilseed. The seed oil is desired as source of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, 18:3, cis 6,9,12-octadecatrienoic acid), for which borage is the highest known plant-based source (17-28%).[4] The seed oil content is between 26-38% and in addition to GLA contains the fatty acids palmitic acid (10-11%), stearic acid (3.5-4.5%), oleic acid (16-20%), linoleic acid (35-38%), eicosenoic acid (3.5-5.5%), erucic acid (1.5-3.5%), and nervonic acid (1.5%). The oil is often marketed as "starflower oil" or "borage oil" for uses as a GLA supplement, although healthy adults will typically produce ample GLA through dietary linoleic acid. Borage production does include use as either a fresh vegetable or a dried herb. As a fresh vegetable, borage, with a cucumber like taste, is often used in salads or as a garnish.[5] The flower, which contains the non-toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloid thesinine,[citation needed] has a sweet honey-like taste and as one of the few truly blue-colored edible substances,[citation needed] is often used to decorate dessert.[5] It is notable that the leaves have been found to contain small amounts (10 ppm of dried herb) of the liver-toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids: intermedine, lycopsamine, amabiline and supinine.[6] The levels are extremely low (2-10 ppm). Leaves contain mainly the non toxic lycopsamine also amabiline and the non-toxic saturated PA thesinine (the only alkaloid found in seed contained thesinine and amabiline in a ratio of 10:1). No alkaloids have been found so far in seed oil.[7][8] Vegetable use of borage is common in Germany, in the Spanish regions of Aragn and Navarra, in the Greek island of Crete and in the Italian northern region Liguria. Although often used in soups, one of the better known German borage recipes is the Green Sauce (Grne Soe) made in Frankfurt. In Italian Liguria, borage is commonly used as filling of the traditional pasta ravioli and pansoti. The leaves and flowers were originally used in Pimms before it was replaced by mint or cucumber peel. It is used to flavour pickled gherkins in Poland.[citation needed] Borage is also traditionally used as a garnish in the Pimms Cup cocktail,[5] but is sometimes replaced by a long sliver of cucumber peel if not available. It is also one of the key "Botanical" flavourings in Gilpin's Westmorland Extra Dry Gin. Borage leaves have a cucumber like flavor.[5] In Iran people sometimes put it in their tea.[citation needed] Naturopathic practitioners use borage for regulation of metabolism and the hormonal system, and consider it to be a good remedy for PMS and menopause symptoms, such as the hot flash.[citation needed] Borage is sometimes indicated to alleviate and heal colds, bronchitis, and respiratory infections, and in general for its anti-inflammatory and balsamic properties.[citation needed] The flowers can be prepared in infusion to take advantage of its medicinal properties. The oleic and palmitic acid of borage may also confer a hypocholesterolemic effect.[citation needed] Traditionallly Borago officinalis is used in hyperactive gastrointestinal, respiratory and cardiovascular disorders.[9] A methanol extract has shown in vitro amoebicidal activity against Entamoeba histolytica[10] Theoreticallly, omega-6 fatty acid -linoleic acid (GLA),may lower the epileptic seizure threshold[11], and one case of status epilepticus has been reported that was assciated with borage Oil ingestion and high blood GLA levels[12] Borage is used in companion planting.[13] It is said to protect or nurse legumes, spinach, brassicas, and even strawberries.[14] It is also said to be a good companion plant to tomatoes because it confuses the search image of the mother moths of tomato hornworms or manduca looking for a place to lay their eggs.[15] Claims that it improves tomato growth [16] and makes them taste better [17] remain unsubstantiated.
