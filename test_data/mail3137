Robert Sterling Hand (born December 5, 1942) is an American astrologer, author, translator, and lecturer, who received the Regulus Award for his life's work at the "United Astrology Conference" in Denver in 2008.[1] Hand was born in Plainfield, New Jersey. He graduated with a B.A. in history from Brandeis University and attended Princeton University. He is currently studying at the Catholic University of America for his Ph.D. in medieval history. Hand began studying astrology in 1960 at the age of 17. His father, Wilfred Hand, taught him the basics of casting astrological charts, saying he was a specialist in heliocentric astrology and cosmobiology; his father also claimed to have used astrological cycles for use in forecasting the financial and stock markets.[2] In 1972 Rob began practicing astrology as a full-time profession. He began writing programs for microcomputers in 1977 in order to bring the benefits of fast and accurate calculations to the practice of astrology. Out of this effort, he founded Astro-Graphics Services in 1980 which later become Astrolabe, Inc.(see also Astrology and computers). Hand founded the Archive for the Retrieval of Historical Astrological Texts (ARHAT) in 1997, an archive that publishes translations of ancient and medieval texts pertaining to the ancient/classical/medieval study of astrology.[3] ARHAT Media Inc. and The Robert Hand Library now house the original texts and translations of dozens of ancient, classical, and medieval astrologers/astronomers, philosophers, and scientists. Mr. Hand has also served as Chairman of the National Council of Geocosmic Research, and holds membership in other organizations including the Association for Astrological Networking (AFAN), the International Society for Astrological Research (ISAR), the Astrological Lodge of London, the Astrological Association of Great Britain (as a patron of the Faculty of Astrological Studies). He is the current Chairman of the Board for Kepler College of Astrological Arts and Sciences. Robert Hand lectures in conferences, seminars, and workshops worldwide and operates an astrological consulting practice in the Washington, D.C area. He offers professional astrological services to astrologers and the general public, using tropical, heliocentric, sidereal, Uranian, cosmobiological, Astrological Mapping and inmundo techniques with classical, medieval and modern methods. Hand is the author, editor, and/or translator of several books. His major works to date include:
