The Democratic League in Montenegro (Demokratski Savez u Crnoj Gori - Lidhja Demokratike n Mal t Zi) is an Albanian minority political party in Montenegro. At the last legislative elections in Montenegro, in March 2009, the party won 1 out of 81 seats. It was one of the key organizers (together with the Liberals) of the Montenegrin independence referendum, 1992. It brought heaps of controversy as Milo ukanovi stated that the only reason for this demand is the Yugoslavian Albanians separatism across Kosovo, Preevo in South Serbia, west Macedonia, claiming that they are doing a similar thing in Montenegro (although that time under the disguise of Montenegrin independence).
