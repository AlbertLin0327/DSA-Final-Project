Minneapolis Washburn High School is a four-year public high school serving grades 912 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. By enrollment, Washburn is the fourth-largest high school in the Minneapolis Public School District. Principal Mrs. Carol Markham-Cousins is assisted by two assistant principals. Washburn High School was built in 1925 to meet the demands of the growing South Minneapolis neighborhood. Construction for the new three-story building began in 1924 after the Minneapolis Board of Education purchased unused land in Washburn Park. Land next to the school was occupied by the Washburn Memorial Orphan Asylum, now torn down and replaced with what is now Ramsey International Fine Arts Center. Washburn is located in the Tangletown neighborhood of southern Minneapolis at 201 West 49th Street.[3] Washburn opened on September 8, 1925 to 1,031 students. When the school opened, it served 710 grades and added one year each year for the next two years. It served middle school and high school students until 1929.[4] The school became very popular and by 1931, 2,370 students attended the school built for 1,500.[5] The school has been expanded several times to meet the demands of high enrollment.[4][6] The school is conventionally named after Cadwallader C. Washburn. When the school was presented to the school board it was called "William D. Washburn High School", in reference to the brother of Cadwallader C. Washburn, however naming the school after William D. Washburn is thought to be an error.[4] The school has been heavily influenced by Minneapolis' milling empire. The school's newspaper, The Grist, involves milling terminology[3], the school's colors, blue and orange, were those of Gold Medal Flour, a company partly run by the Washburn family and a predecessor to General Mills[7] and the athletic teams' nickname are the "Millers". Washburn is located on a 4-city block parcel bordered by West 49th and 50th streets on the north and south side and Nicollet Ave. S. and Pleasant Ave. S on the east and west.[8] In addition to Washburn, Ramsey International Fine Arts Center shares this parcel of land, with Washburn taking 2/3 of the space. In between the schools is A. E. MacQuarrie Field which hosts football games and track and field matches. In addition, on the Washburn campus is a green space known as the Mall. Youth soccer teams use the mall for practice, while students at the school use it for physical education classes. A tunnel connects the east side of Washburn and the west side of Ramsey, running under MacQuarrie Field. The tunnel transports heating and air conditioning between the schools. During the winter, snow melts directly above the tunnel due to the steam pipes within showing the tunnel's location. Decades ago, students used the tunnel during the winter when overcrowding forced Washburn to hold classes in Ramsey. In the 20062007 school year, Washburn enrolled 1,217[2] students. The same year, the school reported a racial makeup of 50.7% Black, 26.0% White, 12.2% Hispanic, 7.7% Asian and 3.4% American Indian.[2] The majority of students qualify for Free and Reduced Price Lunch with 60%.[2] Free and Reduced Price Lunch is the measure of poverty for the district. 18% of students have limited English proficiency and 13% of students qualify for special education.[2] The school has an Adequate Yearly Progress graduation rate of 89.94%[2] while district-wide 43.7% of students graduated during the 20032004 school year.[9][10] 29%[2] of students met or exceeded the standards in the 10th grade Minnesota Comprehensive Assessment Series II test, while 14%[2] met or exceeded the standards for the 11th grade MCAS test in 2007. During the 20072008 school year, 74 percent of the students were of African, Hispanic, Asian, or Native American descent.[11] Since 1991[12], Washburn has participated in St. Olaf College's Educational Talent Search TRIO program which provides students with skills necessary to complete high school and earn postsecondary education.[13][14] During the 20062007 school year, Washburn employed 95.12 staff FTE.[2] 59.34 of those staff were teachers.[2] 44.34% of the teachers held a bachelor's degree while 52.29% held a master's degree.[2] During the 20052006 school year, the student to teacher ratio was 21:1.[15] Both parents and students are involved in the decision-making process through our student council, school leadership team and Parent/Advisory Boards for each SLC.[16] Washburn offers 10 different Pre-AP Courses at ninth and tenth grade; Honors, Advanced Placement and College in the Schools (CIS)[18] for tenth, eleventh and twelfth grade students to earn college credit[19] free of charge.[20] The school also uses school-wide advisory programs to form trusting and caring relationships for each student. Washburn offers bilingual classes in Somali, and English as a Second Language (ESL) support is also available. Washburn currently offers two world languages: French and Spanish. The school also offers jazz band, concert band, orchestra and concert choir. Washburn students have a variety of opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities ranging from Jazz Band to Anime to Young Life. These activities take place before and after school. Notable organizations include, The Grist newspaper, The Wahian yearbook, Educational Talent Search, Elevation, First Robotics, GSA (Gay Straight Alliance), National Honor Society and Student Government. Washburn is a member of the Minnesota State High School League[21] and offers Boys and Girls varsity level sports, including: Boys' athletics Baseball Basketball Cross country running Cross country skiing Football Rugby Golf Water Polo Hockey Soccer Swimming Tennis Track and field Wrestling Badminton Basketball Cross country running Cross country skiing Golf Gymnastics Hockey (Citywide team) Soccer Softball Swimming Tennis Track and field Volleyball Wrestling In March 2008, the Minneapolis Board of Education announced that Washburn would be one of two high schools participating in the Minneapolis Public Schools Fresh Start program. Along with Edison High School, Washburn hired new teachers and staff and examined their curriculum.[22][23] These changes were part of a nine-point-plan by the Minneapolis school board to alleviate budget problems and prepare 4 out of 5 graduates to be ready for college.[22][23] Principal Carol Markham-Cousins returned to lead the school with the rest of the teaching staff required to apply for rehire or as new to the building. On May 14, 2008 Markham-Cousins sent letters to students and family members explaining the reasons for the Fresh Start. She cited graduation rates and college preparation as two reasons why the program had to go forward.[24] The same day, students staged a walk-out in protest of the program.[25] Student drew with chalk on the sidewalk in front of the school in support of the teachers.[25] Additional changes that came to Washburn during 2008-2009 included an increase in the number of art classes and the introduction of the International Baccalaureate program.[22][23] Minneapolis Public Schools has said that Washburn will be one of four high schools moving to a college-ready curriculum, but exact implementation of this plan remains to be seen.[26]
