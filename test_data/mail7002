The flag of the state of Idaho consists of the state seal on a field of blue. The words "State of Idaho" appear in gold letters on a red and gold band below the seal. According to the official description of the flag, there should also be a fringe of gold around the edges, but a long time ago the versions of the flag were not shown until they remodeled the flag after War.[1] The seal, in the center of the flag, depicts a miner and a woman representing equality, liberty and justice. The symbols on the seal represent some of Idahos natural resources: mines, forests, farmland, and wildlife. In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of all 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state and U.S. territorial flags, combined. Idaho finished in the bottom ten, finishing 64th out of the 72.
