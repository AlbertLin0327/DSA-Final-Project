Anthony Lavar Hanshaw is a professional boxer, from Massillon, Ohio. He was born on March 28, 1978, in Warren, Ohio. Hanshaw graduated from Mansfield Senior High School in 1996. He is primarily known for his stellar amateur career but lost his two big fights in the pro ranks. A naturally left-handed boxer who fights from the right-handed stance, he beat Sechew Powell, Kelly Pavlik and Sergio Mora but lost to Jermain Taylor. Just before the 2000 Olympic trials, his father had an accident at work and died. Hanshaw did not qualify. He won the 1998 National Golden Gloves championships at 147 pounds and was 2000 U.S. National champion at 156 pounds. His record was 300-22. Hanshaw turned professional in 2000 as a Super Middleweight (168lb) under powerful Shelly Finkel and started very actively with 11 fights in his first year as a professional. The Ring magazine featured him early. He fought a credible opponent in July 2001 in previously undefeated middleweight Kingsley Ikeke and was awarded the narrow decision. Ikeke later had an IBF title shot at middleweight. Later, he was rather inactive; it took him until 2006 to step it up a little and beat Esteban Camou (record 19-1) and Lafarrell Bunteng (16-1-1) and to draw with the undefeated French amateur star Jean Paul Mendy (23-0). A fight with Roy Jones Jr. took place on July 14, 2007, at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in Biloxi, Mississippi, at a catch weight of 175 lb. Jones Jr. won the bout by decision after dropping Hanshaw in the 11th round. He lost his final fight to Andre Dirrell by fifth round technical knockout on May 2, 2008.
