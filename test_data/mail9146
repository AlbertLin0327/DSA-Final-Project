The Planet Is Alive...Let it Live! is a 1984 studio album by Sarah Vaughan, of the poetry of Pope John Paul II translated by Gene Lees.[1] In 1995 the album was reissued on CD as The Mystery of Man. The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album one and a half stars and said that "Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of everyone involved, the results often sound rather ponderous...The best pieces are the two original ones by Lees ("The Mystery of Man" and "Let It Live") but otherwise this is a difficult set to sit through, not only from the jazz standpoint (the impressive all-stars who are in the orchestra are largely wasted) but musically; everything is too serious and a bit pompous. Skip".[1]
