Listed here are the weapons of silat. The most common are the kris, spear, machete, stick, kerambit, sickle and sarong. Edged weapons are given priority in silat, but the stick and sarong are also popular for self-defense. Because Southeast Asian society was traditionally based around agriculture, many of these weapons were originally farming tools. The badik or badek is a small, straight knife originating among the Makasar and Bugis people. They may be double or single-edged and range in length from twenty to forty centimetres. The chipan (also spelled cipan or jipan) is a battle-axe, the weaponised form of the domestic kapak (axe) or beliong (hatchet). Two are sometimes wielded at once, with one in each hand. While the kapak and beliong were originally designed for cutting wood or chopping down trees, they could be improvised as chipan if needed. The kerambit or gerambi is a narrow-bladed curved weapon resembling the claw of big cats. It is held by inserting the first finger into the hole in the handle, so that the blade curves from the bottom of the fist. Although usually wielded singly they may also be paired. Not only are they difficult to disarm, the kerambit is also easily hidden on account of its compact size. This concealability was the main reason for the weapon's fame. The kerambit was often regarded as a lady's weapon because women would tie them into their hair. The kris or keris is a type of dagger, often with a pistol-gripped handle. It is the main weapon of most silat styles. The kris is characterised by its distinctive wavy blade, but originally most of them were straight. The blade is given its characteristic shape by folding different types of metal together and then washing it in acid. Traditional kris were said to be infused with venom during their forging but the method of doing this was a closely guarded secret among blacksmiths. Even a scratch from a poisonous kris might be fatal and a clean hit could reputedly kill a person in seconds, depending on the blacksmith's skill and the type of venom used. The kris is usually wielded on its own but it can also be paired. Kujang is a curved blade native to Sundanese people of West Java, Indonesia. Often used in Pencak Silat combat in Sundanese style, especially Cimande school. The parang is a chopper or cleaver which, like a machete, is used to cut through overgrowth. They may be curved or straight and range in size from small handheld knives to the length of a sword. Because they are so widely available, parang are one of the most popular weapons in silat. A variant of the parang is the golok. The pedang is Malay-Indonesian word for "sword". The Indian-style long sword has been introduced in the region since the adoption of Hindu-Buddhist faith as early as 4th century, and was found in the bas reliefs of temples in Java. The 9th century statue of Durga and Manjusri in ancient Java art often carrying a sword. According to Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian canto XVII dated 1518, pedang and kris were the weapons of ksathriyas (kings, knights and nobles). Pisau is a generic word for blade. It comes from the Cantonese term peng sau and can refer to a sword or knife, both double or single-edged. The wooden sheaths of most edged weapons can be used for blocking, parrying or striking. Knives, or churiga, can almost always be paired but this isn't always done with swords in silat. The modern word for sword is pedang but this term is ambiguous since it could be translated as scythe. Southeast Asian swords differ considerably from one community to another but they are generally made for one-handed use. Varieties of swords include the pedang jenawi or longsword, the kujang from the Sunda Islands, the gedubang or Acehnese sabre, and the long-handled dap. Javanese swords were derived from those of India. Some are straight while others have a "bent" curve. Swords on the Malay Peninsula are usually one-edged with a slight curve, resembling the Burmese dha and the Thai sword used in krabi krabong. The rencong or renchong is a pistol-gripped knife created by the Minangkabau who originated in West Sumatra. It is popularly known as tumbuk lada (or tumbuak lado in the Minangkabau language), meaning "pepper crusher". The blade is straight but with a slight curve. In terms of social stature, the rencong is in Minang culture comparable to the kris in other parts of Maritime Southeast Asia. Similar to Japanese Kama, the sabit is a sickle originally employed when harvesting crops. It may be paired and, like the parang, it is very popular among silat practitioners, especially Madurese people of East Java. The sundang is a sword created by the Bugis who originated in Sulawesi. As with the kris, the sundang usually features a wavy blade, but straight-bladed specimens also exist. Cakera (also spelled chakra, chakera or cakra) literally means wheel or disc. In silat, the word can refer either to energy centres along the body or a circular weapon made of steel. It was based on the chakram or war-quoit but, unlike its Indian counterpart, the cakera is torus-like rather than flat or sharp. The cakera is often paired and it can either be thrown or wielded as a blunt weapon in close combat. The gedak is a steel mace, essentially consisting of a sphere connected to a handle. Originally from India, it is often associated with the monkey god Hanuman. It is possible to use two gedak at once but, because of their size and weight, this is best suited for larger and more muscular fighters. The words toyak, belantan or tembong refers to a cudgel, cane or short stick. Sticks are also commonly called kayu which means literally means wood, though it could be made of any material. The techniques used with the stick could also be applied to similar objects for the purpose of self-defense. Most notable among these is the seruling or flute played during silat demonstrations as well as other cultural performances. Literally meaning stingray tail, the ekor pari is a whip. Also known as a sauku, it is usually made of rope. Whips were originally used for urging animals forward or punishing criminals, and also as a form of torture. It was carried by wrapping it around the waist underneath the sarong. The whip was said to be popular among female silat exponents because of its light weight. The rantai is a chain which can be swung or used to lock and seize opponents. It can sometimes be substituted with a length of rope (tali). In some styles, a spearhead is attached to one end of the chain or rope. The batang or galah is a staff, pole or rod. Silat exponents regard it as the most versatile of all weapons. They are typically made of bamboo or wood but some are also made from steel. The word galah refers to the pole used for knocking fruit down from trees or when punting a boat. Staves can also be referred to as tiang, kayu or tongkat, the latter term meaning walking stick. Depending on its shape, the handle of a tongkat may be used to sweep an opponent or catch their weapon. Aside from the staff's shorter variations, some styles also use large, thick poles. A longstaff is called galah panjang. The chakok or golok chakok is a hooked staff or billhook, originally used to prune or lop branches from trees. Its weaponised form is a hook-spear, a polearm combining the head of a hook and spear. This implement was most often used as an elephant-goad. Southeast Asian royals and generals would ride elephants either into war or during processions. Every elephant was guarded by one to four handlers, each of whom carried a chakok. The changkul is a hoe used for loosening and breaking up hard soil, or for drawing up earth around plants. It consists of a sharp-edged, steel rectangle mounted to the end of a pole. The geranggang or seligi is a primitive spear or javelin constructed from a sharpened stick of bamboo. The difference between the terms is that seligi refers to the dart or spear intended for throwing. Sumatrans would make short lances from nibong or sago-wood. Over a period of days or weeks, the sharpened end would be buried in ashes, steamed, smoked and charred. The finished weapon could be thrown or used hand-to-hand, and was said to be able to pierce armour more efficiently than iron. The penchakar (lit. "scratcher" or "clawer") is a rake, a toothed crossbar connected to the end of a pole. It was originally used by farmers to level, clear, or break up ground and for smoothening loose soil. The tombak is a lance while the lembing is a spear. Both terms are often used interchangeably but tombak actually refers to non-missile weapons which are circular at the base of the blade, rather than spatulate. Lembing can be used for either a spear or javelin. Early spears were made entirely of wood. The steel-tipped spear was, along with the kris and shield, one of the main weapons used by soldiers in Maritime Southeast Asia. The most common type is the tombak benderang which has red-dyed horse hair attached near the blade. Contrary to the common misconception that it is used to distract the opponent, the horse-hair's true purpose is to prevent the enemy's blood from dripping onto the handle. The trisula is a trident, the weaponised form of the serampang or three-pronged fishing-spear. A related weapon is the lembing tikam pari or three-barbed spear. Asian mythology links the trident with the supernatural, so it is sometimes called tongkat sakti or magic staff. Literally meaning "branch", the tjabang is a iron truncheon with two prongs similar to the Okinawan sai.[3] Called tjabang in Indonesian and tekpi in Malay. The origin of the tjabang may have come from the influence of the Hindu culture on Indonesia between 300A.D. and 400A.D. The Indian trisula is thought to have been the prototype for the tjabang.[4] Tjabang are traditionally paired and can be used in striking, locking or throwing techniques. The two outer prongs are used for trapping the weapon or breaking the opponent's weapon. Among silat practitioners, the tjabang is known as the king of weapons because of its usefulness when defending against blades. The kipas is a folding fan which people used to keep themselves cool in Southeast Asia's tropical heat. Although created in China (where it is known as tieshan), the fan is common to many Asian cultures, as can be seen in traditional Indonesian-Malay dances. As a weapon the fan should be able to open and close easily with one hand, particularly if two are being wielded at once. Usually made of bamboo, more combat-worthy kipas are constructed from harder wood or iron. The perisai is a shield, typically paired with a spear or javelin. Shields in silat are generally round bucklers made of rattan. However, the indigenous tribes of Malaysia and Indonesia commonly wield the jebang, a long hexagonal wooden shield. The samping is a wearable sarong usually tied around the waist or draped across one shoulder. Related weapons include the linso or kerchief, and the chindai or Sindhi waist-sash made of silk. Students first use it for practicing hand movements but in advanced stages it is applied as a weapon. Samping techniques include locks, grabs and choke-holds. It can also be used to trap the opponent's weapon or attacking limb. The samping is particularly useful against bladed weapons since the wrapped cloth provides some protection from cuts. The gandewa is a bow, though it is more often referred to as a busar or busur today. It was a common hunting weapon even among the region's aboriginal tribes (orang asal), but was later replaced by the senapang or rifle. The gandewa is very rarely taught in modern silat schools. The sumpitan is a blowpipe, a hollow bamboo tube through which poisonous darts (damak) are shot. It is one of the oldest weapons in the region, having been used as a hunting tool by Proto-Malays since prehistoric times. The blowpipe is also the most popular long-range weapon in silat and was most often used to kill someone unawares. It typically measures 1.8m long and is made from two pieces of bamboo, one for the barrel and one for the casing. In close combat, it could be wielded as a stick. In Malaysia, the orang asli are considered the greatest masters of the blowpipe. Tribes such as the Iban of Sarawak used a hollow spear which could shoot arrows, thus combining the characteristics of a projectile and hand-to-hand weapon. The jian is a straight Chinese double-edge sword. It is one of the oldest known weapons to have been adopted from outside Southeast Asia, and is depicted on bas-reliefs in Srivijaya dating back more than one thousand years. Because it is lightweight and easily broken, the jian is hardly ever used for blocking. Instead, the fighter must rely on agility to dodge and avoid attacks. In silat, the Chinese sword can be used singly or in a pair. The katana is a Japanese sword with a slight curve and a single edge. When it was first brought to Southeast Asia is unclear but the katana became more widely adopted in the region around the time of the Japanese Occupation. Its application in silat is quite distinct, more reminiscent of krabi krabong or banshay than actual kenjutsu.
