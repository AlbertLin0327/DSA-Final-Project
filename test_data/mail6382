Linthicum Heights Historic District is a national historic district at Linthicum Heights, Anne Arundel County, Maryland. It consists of a suburban community surrounding the intersection of Camp Meade Road (MD 170) and Maple Road. The community is situated on a series of low hills about three miles south of the Patapsco River and includes 17 tree-shaded streets created originally as a planned railroad suburb on the lines connecting Baltimore, Annapolis, and Washington, beginning in 1908. The district consists of 254 contributing resources, including two churches, a cemetery, and a former commercial/residential building. Most of the housing was built prior to 1939 and include examples of the Bungalow, American Foursquare, Colonial Revival, Dutch Revival, and Tudor Revival styles.[2] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.[1] Streetscape in Linthicum Heights Historic District, December 2009
