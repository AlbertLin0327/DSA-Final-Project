Jules Bianchi (born August 3, 1989 in Nice, France) is a French racing driver. Jules is the grandson of Mauro Bianchi, three-times World Champion in the GT category, and the grandnephew of Lucien, who won the 24 Hours of Le Mans and competed in nineteen Grands Prix in the Formula One World Championship between 1959 and 1968, with a podium finish in Monaco. In 2007 Bianchi left karting and raced in French Formula Renault 2.0 for SG Formula, where he finished as champion. He was signed to drive for Formula Three Euroseries team ART Grand Prix in late 2007. Bianchi is currently managed by ART boss Nicolas Todt, manager of Formula One driver Felipe Massa. In 2008 Bianchi won the Masters of Formula 3 at Zolder,[1] and also finished third in the 2008 Formula Three Euroseries season. Bianchi continued in the F3 Euroseries in 2009, leading ART's line-up along with rookie team-mates Valtteri Bottas, Esteban Gutirrez and Adrien Tambay.[2] With eight wins, Bianchi sealed the title with a round to spare, at Dijon-Prenois. He then added a ninth win at the final round at Hockenheim. He also drove in the Formula Renault 3.5 Series at Monaco, after SG Formula acquired the cars formerly run by Kurt Mollekens.[3] Bianchi drove for ART in the forthcoming GP2 Asia season and the 2010 GP2 Series season.[4] He competed in three of the four rounds of the GP2 Asia championship.[5] In the main series, Bianchi took two pole positions and a number of points positions before he was injured in a first-lap crash at the Hungaroring. In the feature race, he spun into the path of the field exiting the first corner, and was struck head-on by Ho-Pin Tung, sustaining a fractured second lumbar vertebra in the process.[6] Bianchi was fourth in the drivers' championship at the time of his injury. Despite initial pessimistic assessments of the severity of his injury, he recovered to take part in the next round of the championship.[7] Bianchi remained with ART for 2011, and was partnered by 2010 GP3 Series champion Esteban Gutirrez. He starred in the first two rounds of the 2011 GP2 Asia Series, holding off Romain Grosjean for victory in the feature race[8] and gaining fourth in the sprint race,[9] but he was later penalised.[10] He finished runner-up to Grosjean in the drivers' championship. In the main series, Bianchi had a difficult start to the season, only scoring points in two of first eight races, but his form improved after scoring his first win at Silverstone. He eventually finished third in the championship, behind Grosjean and Luca Filippi. In August 2009, Bianchi was linked by the BBC and various other media sources to the second Ferrari Formula One seat occupied by Luca Badoer during Felipe Massa's absence.[11][12] Bianchi tested for Ferrari at the young drivers test at Circuito de Jerez for two of the three days, over December 12, 2009.[13] This allowed for Ferrari to test Daniel Zampieri, Marco Zipoli and Pablo Snchez Lpez on December 3, as they finished in the top three of the 2009 Italian Formula Three Championship. Bianchi's performance on day one of the test led to him being signed by Scuderia Ferrari as a young driver along with Daniel Zampieri, Mirko Bortolotti and Raffaele Marciello.[14] On 11 November 2010 he was confirmed by Ferrari as the team's test and reserve driver for the 2011 season, replacing Luca Badoer, Giancarlo Fisichella and Marc Gen, as well as confirming he would test for the team during the young driver test in Abu Dhabi over 1617 November.[15] On 13 September 2011, Bianchi tested for Ferrari as part of the Ferrari Driver Academy, with fellow academy member and Sauber F1 driver Sergio Prez.[16]   As Bianchi was a guest driver, he was ineligible to score points.
