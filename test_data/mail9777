Seychelles Marketing Board (SMB), is a government parastatal company based in Victoria, Seychelles. Since its formation in 1985, it has dominated the importation of goods to Seychelles, particularly essential goods. SMB also operates a prawn farm on Cotivy Island. Until 2008 the football team now called Super Magic Brothers was called "Seychelles Marketing Board".
