The TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours (TNM) is a cancer staging system that describes the extent of cancer in a patients body. The TNM staging system for all solid tumors was devised by Pierre Denoix between 1943 and 1952, using the size and extension of the primary tumor, its lymphatic involvement, and the presence of metastases to classify the progression of cancer.[1] TNM is developed and maintained by the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) to achieve consensus on one globally recognised standard for classifying the extent of spread of cancer. The TNM classification is also used by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). In 1987, the UICC and AJCC staging systems were unified into a single staging system. Most of the common tumors have their own TNM classification. Not all tumors have TNM classifications, e.g., there is no TNM classification for brain tumors. The general outline for the TNM classification is below. The values in parentheses give a range of what can be used for all cancer types, but not all cancers use this full range. For the T, N and M parameters exist subclassifications for some cancer-types (e.g. T1a, Tis, N1i) Some of the aims for adopting a global standard are to: Since the number of combinations of categories is high, combinations are grouped to stages for better analysis. It is crucial to be aware that the criteria used in the TNM system have varied over time, sometimes fairly substantially, according to the different editions that AJCC and UICC have released. The dates of publication and adoption for use of AJCC editions is summarized here; past editions are available from AJCC for web download. [2] As a result, a given stage may have quite a different prognosis depending on which staging edition is used, independent of any changes in diagnostic methods or treatments, an effect that has been termed "stage migration." The technologies used to assign patients to particular categories have changed also, and by intuitive consideration it can be seen that increasingly sensitive methods tend to cause individual cancers to be reassigned to higher stages, making it improper to compare that cancer's prognosis to the historical expectations for that stage. Finally, of course, a further important consideration is the effect of improving treatments over time as well. M: NEO tsoc, mrkr tumr, epon, para drug (L1i/1e/V03)
