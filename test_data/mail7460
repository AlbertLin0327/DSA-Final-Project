Wheels Within Wheels is a blues-orientated acoustic rock album by Rory Gallagher. Featuring a range of acoustic styles including flamenco, skiffle and traditional Irish music,[2] the album was compiled from lost recordings and outtakes by Gallagher's brother Donal and released posthumously. A number of notable musicians appeared on the album, and the songs were recorded in various locations all over the world between 1974 and 1994. The album cover was designed by David Oxtoby.[3] All tracks written by Rory Gallagher except where stated.
