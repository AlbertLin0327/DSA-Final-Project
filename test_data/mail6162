Martin Harley (born 1975, Cardiff, Wales) is a British singer-songwriter and slide guitarist. Specialising in folk and blues, he and his band have released four albums between 2003 and 2010. Harley moved with his family to Woking, Surrey, England as a small child. He is the founder of The Martin Harley Band, a British blues trio. The band has a diverse appeal, attracting blues fans as well as a cult following amongst surfers. This may be due to tours and support slots with G. Love & Special Sauce,[1] Ash Grunwald,[2] Newton Faulkner and Donovan Frankenreiter,[3] Carus and The True Believers and The Beautiful Girls. The band are renowned for their live concerts and the obscure instrumentation they use, which includes a Weissenborn guitar, balalaika, cocktail drumkit, cajon and double bass. To date they have released three albums, all of which have been released on independent record labels with national distribution. The Martin Harley Band are a regularly touring ensemble, and have toured with James Morrison,[4] appeared on BBC Radio 2 on the Aled Jones, Bob Harris and Johnnie Walker shows.[5] Harley has also been interviewed by Guitarist magazine, and featured in a three DVD set providing slide guitar tips and tricks.[6] The band are favourites of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, and have played several gigs at River Cottage H.Q., and appeared on a charity compilation album sold to raise money for Rural Revival and CARE International.[7] Harley is currently endorsed by the luthier, Andreas Cuntz.[8] In 2005 Harley took part in what has been recognised by Guinness World Records as the 'Highest Gig in the World', playing at 21,000 feet up Kala Patthar in the Himalayas.[9] For this concert Harley was endorsed by Blueridge Guitars.[10][11] In early 2007, he spent six weeks wandering though Mali, Guinea and Senegal in the company of some of those country's musicians. The event was recorded by a French film crew, and a CD and DVD is scheduled for release. One of the sessions included Vieux Farka Toure. In 2010, Harley undertook the "Blues Gone Green Tour", a 27 show, 1,200 mile acoustic tour of the UK by bicycle over thirty one days. The tour was supported by Sustrans, Villages in Action plus the Rural Touring Circuit and Surly Bikes.[12] Harley's slide guitar work can also be heard on Kate Walsh's Tim's House,[13] Fink's Biscuits for Breakfast, and Hardkandy's Second to None.[14]
