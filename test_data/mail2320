DAB: Mux 1 RT Pulse is an electronic dance music station from Raidi Teilifs ireann (RT), Ireland's national broadcaster. It broadcasts on the RT DAB Multiplex and Saorview, Ireland's free to air DTT service in Ireland, online and on UPC cable television. It plays a varied mix of dance music, with a small number of shows covering RnB. It started broadcasting in April 2008, but had an official launch alongside its sister services on 1 December 2008. Originally started as a jukebox service with no presenters, it now carries live and pre-recorded shows from a number of Irish and international DJs, including Jason Dee, Nikki Hayes, Will Kinsella, Paul Byrne, Stephen Daly, Brian Taffe, Orla Feeney, Al Redmond, and David Cronin. The service regularly carries live outside broadcasts, such as the 2008 Southern edition of PlanetLove. It regularly comes live from the Caf Mambo studios in Ibiza. The service uses RT facilities from all around the country and overseas. There are regular weekly live shows from the Cork, Limerick, Athlone, Belfast and Castlebar studios. The service regularly broadcasts live from the RT or BBC studios in London. On Wednesday nights programming is dedicated to listeners from the LGBT community, with shows presented by Scott De Buitlir, Nick Randell, Sinad Houlihan, Conor Behan and Jonathan O'Sullivan. The schedule is designed to be stranded in its approach to fulfilling its remit of representing all genres of dance music. Monday evenings for example is House Music, Tuesdays Trance and harder edge and so forth. Sunday's scheduling draws very much from the eclectic styles of the genre.
