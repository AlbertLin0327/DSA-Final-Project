Lincoln Theological College was a theological college in Lincoln, United Kingdom. It opened on 25 January 1874. It was also known as Scholae Cancellarii. The building it occupied on Drury Lane, which was originally the County Infimary, closed in 1995, after having its permit as a college recognised for ordination training was withdrawn by the Church of England citing a to low numbers of candidates nationally. The College had wanted to remain, developing a research institution, possibly affiliated to a nearby university. The buildings are now owned by the Lincoln Theological Institute for the Study of Religion and Society (a registered charity), based at the University of Manchester, established in 1997 by Martyn Percy. Once Lincoln Theological College had closed, the only anglican theological college in the East Midlands offering training for those entering stipendiary ministry was St John's College, Nottingham in Bramcote. At the time of closure the Scholae Cancellarii offered training leading to an externally validated and conferred BTh degree. Lincoln Theological College worked closely with the then-named Bishop Grossteste College, which at the time was a Church of England teacher training college, and shared courses. It also worked with the University of Nottingham, which validated the BEd degrees of BGC. The College's former building on Drury Lane was renamed Chad Varah House[1], in honour of the Samaritan's founder who was educated at the College and served his title in Lincoln. Whilst initially housing a substantial part of the University of Lincoln's School of Art, much of this activity has now been displaced by the School of Theology and Ministry Studies (which was formed in 2009 following the signing, in Lincoln Cathedral, of an agreement between the University of Lincoln, Bishop Grosseteste University College, the Diocese of Lincoln and Lincoln Cathedral on Saturday 14 November 2009.[2]), who now share the building with the University's conservation and restoration & design students.
