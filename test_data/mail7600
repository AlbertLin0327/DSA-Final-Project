24 Oras (24 HOURS) is the flagship national network news broadcast of GMA Network. A nightly national newscast which airs in the Philippines and worldwide via GMA Pinoy TV. It is aired Weeknights at 6:30-8:00 PM, Saturdays at 5:15 to 6:00 PM and Sundays at 6:00 to 6:45 PM (PST). The newscast is simulcasted on radio thru Super Radyo DZBB 594 kHz in Mega Manila and several of its regional Super Radyo stations nationwide. 24 Oras premiered on March 15, 2004 at 6:15pm, replacing Frontpage: Ulat ni Mel Tiangco. Frontpage anchor Mel Tiangco was joined by Saksi's Mike Enriquez, rejoining them in one newscast since they co-anchored Saksi from 1996 to 1998. Special weekend editions are also being aired when it deemed necessary. On December 1, 2005, the coverage by 24 Oras of a siege of Camp Bagong Diwa was mentioned in the best news program category in the Asian Television Awards in Singapore.[1] The show relaunched in April 2006[2] with a new graphics package, and a new set with floating large rear projection screens that allow the anchors to virtually "talk" to correspondents in live feeds. Pia Guanio hosts the showbiz news segment of the program, "Chika Minute". PAGASA's Nathaniel Cruz anchors weather news during severe weather conditions. Joel Reyes Zobel is the voice over talent. On August 11, 2008, the show was relaunched again with a new set, a new desk which is identical to the desk used by CBS Evening News, new graphics and titles. On April 2010, the show became the home of Vizrt Touchscreen system a real-time broadcast solutions system which is use in the YouScoop segment designed and developed by GMA New Media. On December 6, 2010, the news program updated its graphics. A day later, it updated its OBB and title card.  On February 21, 2011, along with Unang Hirit, Saksi, and GMA Flash Report, the newscast introduced a new studio set, new graphics, new theme, and new OBB. The new theme music is a remix of 24 Oras 2008-2011 theme music & an element of an opera voice. On October 10, 2011, 24 Oras updated only it's graphics. The logo on the bottom left corner is now square and features: 24 Oras current logo, Facebook page, Twitter account and GMA News Online URL. The news ticker became shorter than February 2011 24 Oras news ticker. The news ticker of the late 2011 24 Oras shows the return of the time shown on the news ticker (the former is 2006-2011). The headlines at the right of the 24 oras logo is rectangular with the red line at the right of the headlines. Since June 4, 2012, 24 Oras launched its new weather segment, hosted by resident Meteorologist Nathaniel Cruz. Cruz has been the chief weather forecaster for PAGASA and is regularly seen in GMA newscasts for some time before he went to Australia. Before the launch of the weekend edition, 24 Oras occasionally appeared on weekends during special coverages (e.g. typhoons Ondoy and Pepeng, and the Maguindanao massacre) and the weekend before the elections instead of airing GMA Weekend Report. Notable guest anchors (once appeared) for the special edition were Saksi anchors Arnold Clavio and Vicky Morales. On February 21, 2010, the weekend edition of 24 Oras was launched, replacing GMA Weekend Report. Balitanghali anchor Pia Arcangel and Reporter's Notebook host Jiggy Manicad were the anchors of weekend edition. Unlike the weekday edition, one of the anchors narrate the headlines.
