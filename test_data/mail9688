Saint Trinity Chapel, popularly called Anton Bernolk's Chapel, in Nov Zmky, Slovakia, was built in 1722 in the baroque style. This chapel is located in a former stone cemetery of the town which was liquidated in 1872. Jakub kultty had it built to the God's fame. The Chapel is considered a tribute to the codifier of the standard Slovak language, teacher, priest and school supervisor Anton Bernolk. Although his grave has never been found, it is assumed, he is lying somewhere near the chapel. Anton Bernolk came to Nov Zmky on 1 June 1797 and he worked there for 16 years. As well as his duties as priest he acted as a school supervisor. He died in 1813. The chapel has been renovated several times, most recently in 1977.
