"Bless the Broken Road" is a song that has been recorded by several American country music artists. It was co-written by Marcus Hummon, Bobby Boyd and Jeff Hanna in 1994. It was first recorded by Nitty Gritty Dirt Band in 1994 followed by Hummon in 1995 on his album All in Good Time. Since then, many artists have recorded the song with Rascal Flatts's version being the highest-charting, becoming a #1 hit on the Billboard country music charts in 2005 and earning the songwriters a Grammy Award for Best Country Song. Singer-songwriter Marcus Hummon co-wrote the song with Jeff Hanna (of Nitty Gritty Dirt Band) and Bobby Boyd. Nitty Gritty Dirt Band recorded it for their 1994 album Acoustic. One year later, Hummon covered the song for his debut album All in Good Time for Columbia Records.[1] His rendition includes backing vocals from Hanna and Matraca Berg.[2] Michael McCall of New Country magazine thought that Hummon's rendition was the best track on the album.[3] Sons of the Desert recorded its own version of the song, for a planned second album on Epic Records that would have been released in 1998. This album was not released, due to a dispute between the band and its label.[4] Since then, many artists have recorded the song including Melodie Crittenden, Geoff Moore, Sons of the Desert, Selah, Jamie Slocum, Carrie Underwood, Buddy Greene, and Rascal Flatts. Also in 1998, Melodie Crittenden recorded the song under the title "Broken Road," and included it on her self-titled debut album for Asylum Records. Released as the first of two singles from it, this version was a number 42 single on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts.[6] This version was featured on an episode of Dawson's Creek. Billboard gave Crittenden's version a positive review in the January 17, 1998, issue, calling it "sheer poetry with a moving message."[5]  The highest-charting rendition is by the country music group Rascal Flatts, who cut the song for the Feels Like Today album. Released in November 2004, this version spent five weeks at number one on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts. It also won a Grammy Award for Best Country Song[7] and earned a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. As of the chart dated March 19, 2011, the song has sold 2.02 million in the US.[8] On May 25, 2005, during a live performance on American Idol by Carrie Underwood and Rascal Flatts,[9] an additional version was recorded. While not in wide release, and never included on an album, the version received enough radio airplay to enter the country music charts at number 50.[7] On May 19, 2012, "Bless the Broken Road" debuted at number 76 on the UK Singles chart (The Official Charts Company), the band's first and only appearance on the chart. Rascal Flatts' version of the song is in the key of C major, with a vocal range from C4 (Middle C) to A5.[10]  Selah, a contemporary Christian music band, covered the song in 2006 on the album Bless the Broken Road: The Duets Album featuring a duet vocal from Crittenden.[15] Also released as a single, Selah's version peaked at number five on the Hot Christian Songs charts. In 2007, this version of the song was nominated for a Dove Award for Song of the Year at the 38th GMA Dove Awards.[17]
