NHBC (National House-Building Council) states its primary purpose as raising the construction standards of new homes in the UK to protect homeowners. Established in 1936, NHBC is the UKs largest provider of new home warranties. Around 80% of new homes built in the UK each year have an NHBC 10-year warranty. NHBC is also the UKs largest single Approved Inspector for Building Regulations. Its other activities include the provision of services linked to house building and general construction including energy ratings, health and safety, sustainability and training. It also provides industry statistics and benchmarking services. It is a non-profit distributing company so reinvests profit in its activities to improve the quality of new homes to protect the interests of homeowners. NHBC is authorised and regulated by the Financial Services Authority. NHBC offers warranties for newly built or converted private housing, affordable housing, self-build homes and commercial premises located on mixed use housing schemes. Mortgage lenders will usually require that a warranty is in place before lending on a new build property as detailed in the Council of Mortgage Lenders handbook. Builders and developers who sell properties with NHBC warranties must adhere to NHBCs strict standards of construction contained in the NHBC Technical Standards in addition to complying with Building Regulations in the UK. NHBC inspectors visit building sites at key stages to check compliance with its Technical Standards. The stages are usually (but can sometimes be more): foundations, drainage, superstructure (e.g. brickwork), pre-plaster and pre-handover to the buyer. For flats, they also inspect roof construction. The inspection process is not designed to check every detail of the build but if NHBC is satisfied with the overall build quality they will issue the warranty for the new home/premises. Buildmark, the NHBC warranty for private housing is split into 2 parts. In the first 2 years, the builder is responsible for fixing any defects caused by its failure to build to NHBC Technical Standards. If the builder fails to do this or has gone out of business, NHBC will take responsibility to fix the defect. From the start of the third year until the home is 10 years old, NHBC is responsible for putting right defects to the structural and weather-proofing parts of the home caused by breaches of its Technical Standards. In 1985, under the Building Act 1984, NHBC set up a subsidiary company (NHBC Building Control Services Ltd) and became the first private sector building control body licensed as an Approved Inspector for the purpose of verifying that buildings are built in accordance with the building regulations across England and Wales. It is the largest single Approved Inspector in England and Wales (inspecting around 50% or all new-build properties in the UK) and assists builders to achieve compliance and advises on Building Regulations for schemes ranging from residential developments to large commercial and mixed use sites. NHBC offers a range of additional services to help builders comply with Building Regulations, Health and Safety legislation and other construction rules. These include: energy rating services (SAP and SBEM), energy performance certificates, Code for Sustainable Homes and BREEAM assessments, CDM co-ordination, health and safety audits, UKAS accredited testing for sound insulation and air tightness. They also offer a wide range of training courses for building professionals including construction related National Vocational Qualifications NVQs. NHBC compiles and distributes statistics and analysis about the UK housing market that are used by Government and financial institutions, as well as home-builders. Examples are the Housing Market Report and the NHBC Quarterly Statistics. Purchasers of new homes are also surveyed providing statistics about levels of customer satisfaction in their homes. NHBC Pride in the Job competition has been running for 32 years to date and looks to award site managers that are registered to the NHBC Warranty. The award recognises individual site managers and not companies. Every individual eligible site manager is entered into the competition on an annual basis with the judging starting in July. Judging is carried out by NHBC Inspection Staff and Regional Directors throughout the following 18 months, so that a full assessment is carried out on the site managers work of extended periods. The pride in the job competition is assessed based on 38 site activities which are scored to ensure all sites are equally judge to the same criteria. Regional and Supreme Award winners are judged by an independent panel of industry experts who are autonomous to NHBC. The competition is divided into four stages, culminating in the Supreme Awards presented at a gala ceremony. The stages are as follows: Stage 1 - Quality Awards, Stage 2 - Seal of excellence awards, Stage 3 - Regional Awards, Stage 4 - Supreme Awards A Pride in the Job award is a fantastic credit to the individual site manager, as well as to the homes that have been built. The particular manager will be selected for their category from almost 13,000 site managers across the UK to win a quality award. This award provides a number of benefits to the individual winners and to the companies that they work for. The quality award can be recognised as a great way of showing potential new homebuyers of the contribution to the creation of new quality home. The NHBC was criticised on a 2010 edition of the BBC consumer television programme Watchdog for failing to repair homes due to incorrect surveying of problem properties by relevant professionals, and thus failing to either compensate owners financially or fix any problems promptly, for new build properties under their warranty.[1]
