The Mk 92 Fire Control System is a US-built medium-range anti-aircraft missile and gun fire control system. It was developed for the Oliver Hazard Perry class guided missile frigates. The system is a licensed USN version of the Thales Nederland WM-25 fire control system. The Mark 92 fire control system was approved for service use in 1975. Introduction to the fleet and follow-on test and evaluation began in 1978. In 1981, [1] The Mk 92 system assigns targets via the ship's air search radar, and surface search radar or from the MK 92's own search radar capabilities. [2]The system has two or three radar sub-systems depending on the model. The first two are combined in to a single system called the Combined Antenna System or CAS is used in all models. The CAS has a track while scan radar (Search) and a tracking radar both housed in an egg shaped randome. The radars can search for, track, and illuminate targets. There is also a third radar for target illumination referred to as the Separate Target Illumination Radar or STIR. The STIR is a radar developed from the AN/SPG-60 radar that is part of the Mk 86 gun fire control system.  [3] The USN retired the RIM-66E, or Standard missile-1, from active service in 2003. Oliver Hazard Perry frigates in USN service have had the STIR radar removed. The STIR radars are still in use on non-USN vessels.
