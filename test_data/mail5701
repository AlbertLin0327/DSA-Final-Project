Coordinates: 534222N 23938W / 53.706104N 2.66045W / 53.706104; -2.66045 Cuerden is a village and civil parish of the Borough of Chorley, in Lancashire, England. It is situated between Bamber Bridge and Leyland, and has a population of 77.[1] The name derives from the Welsh cerdin, the plural of cerdinen, "rowan". The manor was given to Vivian Molyneux by Roger de Poitou and devolved to the Banastres, Charnocks, Langtons, and Fleetwoods.[2] The manor house, Cuerden Hall, is a country house begun in the 1717 on the site of a 17th century house, and extended between 1816-19 by Lewis Wyatt. During the Industrial Revolution two cotton mills were built by the river by William Clayton and William Eccles and employed more than 700 persons in 1848.[2] St Saviour's Church was built in 183637 to a design by the architect Edmund Sharpe. Cuerden was a township in the ancient ecclesiastical parish of Leyland and the Leyland hundred.[2] It became part of the Chorley Poor Law Union, formed in 1837, which took responsibility for the administration and funding of the Poor Law and built a workhouse in that area.[3] Cuerden coved 800 acres about 4 miles south east of Preston on the River Lostock on the road between Preston and Wigan.[2][4] Cuerden Valley Park, south of the M1 and M65 junction, covers 650 acres, half of which is used for agriculture. The park has a lake and was once the estate of Cuerden Hall.
