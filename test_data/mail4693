The Link is a community-based nonprofit organization, that provides in-home and in-community truancy intervention services; family support; community outreach and trainings; affordable, supportive housing; and after-school and summer youth groups. The Link is located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, serves Hennepin County and is expanding its services throughout the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area.  The mission of The Link is to build a supportive community network that links youth and their families to their inner strength through life skills, education, advocacy, supportive housing, and a dynamic network of social services to transform lives.  The Link was founded in 1991 by Jim Marshall and Oscar Reed, two former Minnesota Vikings football players, in collaboration with the late Leonard Lindquist[1]. The Link began with the vision of bringing opportunity and positive relationships to disempowered youth living in impoverished neighborhoods. This grassroots initiative has since blossomed into an experienced youth service organization serving the community through advocacy, housing, education, and intervention services. Over the last 17 years, The Link has touched the lives of nearly 15,000 youth and their family members through our asset-based service philosophy. Today, The Link continues to build positive relationships with youth that create sustainable positive changes.
