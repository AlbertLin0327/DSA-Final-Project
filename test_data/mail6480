201st overall, 2005 Columbus Blue Jackets Trevor Hendrikx (born March 29, 1985) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenseman who is currently plays for the Allen Americans of the CHL. Hendrikx started his hockey career as a member of the Gloucester Rangers of the Central Tier 1 Junior A Hockey League. He would later move up to the Ontario Hockey League as a member of the Peterborough Petes in 2001. As a member of the Petes, Hendrikx would be drafted by the Columbus Blue Jackets twice. He was taken in the 9th round (283rd overall) in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. He would return to the draft, and the Blue Jackets would re-draft him; this time in the 7th round (201st overall) in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. Hendrikx would put up a career-high 56 points during his final junior season. As a prospect, Hendrikx has spent most of his career in the ECHL as a member of the Blue Jackets' affiliate, with stops in Dayton, Elmira, and Johnstown. Hendrikx re-signed with Johnstown in late October of the 2009-10 ECHL season.[1] On March 13, 2010, Hendrikx along with teammate Mike Bartlett were traded from the Johnstown Chiefs to the Charlotte Checkers for future considerations.[2] On August 12, 2010, the Florida Everblades announced that Hendrikx has agreed to terms for the 2010-11 ECHL season.[3]
