Content:
The metal-ion-catalyzed -bond rearrangement reaction occurs with highly saturated organic ring molecules treated by Ag+, Rh(I), or Pd(II) ions[1]. Two types of the reaction were noted: [2+2] ring openings, and a conversion to another ring system: A mechanism for this rearrangement reaction is not completely understood, however some explanations were suggested.

I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
