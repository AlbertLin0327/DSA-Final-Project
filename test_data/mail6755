I Spy Spooky Mansion Deluxe is a game for Macintosh and Microsoft Windows. The setting of the game is a house that has a door that can only be opened from the outside. As with many I Spy games, the reader looks for anything mentioned, and anything that moves can be an entirely separate I Spy puzzle within the original. I Spy Spooky Mansion Deluxe has three levels. The first centers around a ripped up map. The second involves "Shrinking Soup"[clarification needed] to get out through a hole and complete a puzzle or riddle in each room. On the third level, the only way out is to fix the mansion's ghost machine. On the last level, all rooms but the lab have puzzles or riddles to solve.
