Ethel is a community in Pushmataha County, Oklahoma, six miles east of Antlers, Oklahoma. A United States Post Office was established at Ethel, Indian Territory on April 22, 1901 and operated until August 15, 1933. It was named for Ethel Labors, early-day resident. [1] The loss of Ethels post office was not a verdict on the communitys possible lack of prosperity, but rather was due to its close proximity to Antlers, Oklahoma. The community continued to be active long after the loss of the post office, with a vibrant school and churches. Its school has since closed, but other aspects of organized community life have remained. Today Ethels sole landmark is Ethel Baptist Church, although it continues to be a population center and numerous residences are located just off Ethel Road. More information on Ethel may be found in the Pushmataha County Historical Society. This populated place also has portions in an adjacent county or counties Coordinates: 341346N 953239W / 34.22944N 95.54417W / 34.22944; -95.54417
