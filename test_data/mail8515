Content:
A magnetic (inductive) coil is an element of a magnetic circuit, which is intended to use its magnetic inductivity (self- or mutual) and/or its electric field. A magnetic inductive coil can be made as device with one or a number of turns of a magnetic circuit (for example, made of ferrite) and with a dielectric core (for example, ferroelectric), and is useful in the very-high and ultra-high frequency bands. For lower frequencies, it is implemented as a one-turn magnetic inductor of an electric eddy current or in capacity of the measuring inductive transducer. A magnetic inductive coil is the physical analogue of an electric inductive coil [1-3].
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
