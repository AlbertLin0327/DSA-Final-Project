Alan Reeve was a patient at Broadmoor secure psychiatric hospital in Britain; he had been sent there in 1964 after killing a friend when they were both 15. In 1981 he escaped and remained at large for a year. He was arrested in the Netherlands in 1982 following a gun fight at an off-license during which he killed the police officer Jaap Honingh and for which he was jailed for 15 years. He was released on parole in 1992 and Dutch courts refused to extradite him back to Britain;[1] he lived for the next five years in Ireland until his arrest there in 1997.[2][3] He spent another five months in Broadmoor before it was finally declared that he was no longer a threat to society.
