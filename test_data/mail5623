April Skies was released in 2005, and is the 8th studio album to be released by the group Deine Lakaien. B. Deutung, Ivee Leon, Sharifa, Robert Wilcocks The cd April Skies released on Capital-EMI contains cd Copying Protection, many people have found that this cd will not play on their car cd-players or in certain stereos. Further, in order to play on ones computer, the cd insists on installing its own sub-par cd-player software. Attempts to "crack" the software have received little success. This copy-protection which prevents purchasers from putting the music onto the MP3 player has caused a fan backlash against EMI records with many websites dedicated to people ranting about this problem.
