Faith Church St. Louis is a non-denominational Christian megachurch located in Missouri with campuses in Earth City, MO and Sunset Hills, MO. The church is listed #5 on Outreach Magazine's 2009 list of the 100 fastest growing churches in America. The church's weekly services are broadcast on the ABC affiliate KDNL and are posted weekly on their website. The broadcast times are as follows: Saturday mornings at 1:35 am and Sunday mornings at 12:30 am, 5:30 am & 8:30 am. Within the church there are several event-based groups set up to create a sense of belonging for all ages. Once a month (or more) each group hosts an event, times and locations vary.
