(2S,8R,9S,10R,13S,14S,17S)-17-hydroxy-4,4,10,13,17-pentamethyl-3-oxo-1,2,7,8,9,11,12,14,15,16-decahydrocyclopenta[a]phenanthrene-2-carbonitrile C[C@]12CC[C@H]3[C@H]([C@@H]1CC[C@]2(C)O)CC=C4[C@@]3(C[C@H](C(=O)C4(C)C)C#N)C    Cyanoketone is an androstenol. It has been shown to inhibit steroidogenesis.[1] It inhibits atrophy of apical dendrites.[citation needed]  Note: Anabolic steroids, including those that are only weakly virilizing (or even anti-virilizing (e.g., oxandrolone)), are included here (since their anabolic effects are nonetheless mediated via activation of the androgen receptor). Note: Though not listed here, many anabolic steroids can also be estrogenic as they can be aromatized into estrogen-like metabolites that possess estrogenic activity. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
