Promunturium Lacinium (modern Capo delle Colonne), 7 m. SE of Crotona (modern Crotone); the easternmost point of Bruttii (modern Calabria). On the cape still stands a single column of the temple erected to Hera Lacinia, which is said to have been fairly complete in the 16th century, but to have been destroyed to build the episcopal palace at Crotone. It is a Doric column with capital, about 27ft. in height. Remains of marble roof-tiles have been seen on the spot (Livy xlii.3) and architectural fragments were excavated in 1886-1887 by the Archaeological Institute of America. The sculptures found were mostly buried again, but a few fragments, some decorative terra-cottas and a dedicatory inscription to Hera of the 6th century BC, in private possession at Crotone, are described by F. von Duhn in Notizie degli scavi, 1897, 343 seq. The date of the erection of the temple may he given as 480-440 BC; it is not recorded by any ancient writer. See R. Koldewey and O. Puchstein, Die griechischen Tempel in Unteritalien und Sicilien (Berlin 1899, 41). This articleincorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911).
