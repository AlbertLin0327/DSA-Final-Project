Don't speak French? Click here to read a machine-translated version of the French article. Archingeay Coordinates: 455554N 04217W / 45.9317N 0.7047W / 45.9317; -0.7047 Archingeay is a commune in the Charente-Maritime department in the Poitou-Charentes region in southwestern France. The river Boutonne forms the commune's northwestern border. The origin of name (and the French demonym Arcantois) might be the Roman general Arcantius, who visited the place. Archingeay was a prosperous place in the past, due to its thermal source near the chteau de la Valle, west of Archingeay. It was renowned for its therapeutic properties (digestive diseases, etc.).
