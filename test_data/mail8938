The Gibraltar Botanic Gardens or La Alameda Gardens are a botanical garden in Gibraltar, spanning around 6 hectares (15acres). The gardens were founded in 1816 by Governor of Gibraltar General George Don in order to provide a recreational area for the Garrison at the time. Serving that purpose for many years, the gardens fell into disrepair in the 1970s until the Gibraltar Botanic Gardens project, funded by a firm of environmental consultants and managers, Wildlife (Gibraltar) Limited, came about in 1991. Since 1994, the Gardens contain also a zoo: the Alameda Wildlife Conservation Park. In the Second World War the gardens were a popular meeting place for the thousands of homosexual soldiers and sailors that passed through Gibraltar on their way to the various fronts. In the later years of the war the Military Police regularly raided the gardens to enforce the ban on homosexuality in the British and American armed forces and Merchant Navy[1]. General Don had commissioned a memorial of George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield in 1815, which did not materialise in the form initially requested. A colossal statue of General Eliot, carved from the bowsprit of the Spanish ship San Juan Nepomuceno, taken at the Battle of Trafalgar was created in lieu. The statue was taken to the Governor's residence, The Convent, where it stands today, being replaced by a bronze bust in 1858. The plants of the Alameda Gardens are a combination of native species and others brought in from abroad:
