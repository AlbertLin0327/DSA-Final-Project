Mace Group Ltd, commonly known as Mace, is a global consultancy and construction firm headquartered in London, United Kingdom. It has operations across 65 countries, offering a variety of services that span the entire property life cycle, from fund monitoring, cost consultancy, design management, through pre-construction, construction, fit out, and facilities management. The company was initially founded by a group construction and architecture professionals led by Ian Macpherson who left Bovis in 1990 hoping to bring in some new, more collaborative ways of working in the traditionally combative construction industry. Having attempted to pioneer this construction management approach at Bovis and been turned down Macpherson left to form Mace, a company which would found itself on this innovative way of running projects.[2] The Mace startup team got its first break in 1991 when it beat Bovis and got appointed as project and construction managers on British Airways Waterside headquarters at Heathrow. The company went on to deliver the iconic London Eye on the South Bank, The Venetian in Macau, and in early 2009 was officially appointed to deliver the fixed price Shard of Glass tower above London Bridge station. Mace Group business has grown by combining commercial construction with a move into the public sector (now 50% of the company's turnover) where it now delivers project management to local authorities, delivery of schools and academies, healthcare consultancy to the UK Department of Health, and a number of large scale waste and energy management programmes around the British isles. Mace rebranded in 2008, becoming Mace Group, losing its construction management identity in favour of its by-then enlarged service offer, spanning consultancy services and construction across the entire property life cycle. Its success in large part has been down to a commitment to highly efficient modern processes and empathetic relationships with clients, something older and larger firms in the construction sector were typically perceived not to bother with.[3] Mace's activities involve the following:[4] Major projects involving Mace have included the London Eye completed in 2000,[5] The Venetian in Macau completed in 2007[6] and Shard London Bridge due to be completed in 2012.[7]
