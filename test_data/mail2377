Blah-Blah-Blah is an album by Iggy Pop. Released on A&M in 1986, it became his most commercially successful album to date. Blah Blah Blah appeared after a four-year hiatus for Pop, with David Bowie serving as his prime collaborator. A successful tour followed the album's release. The collection included a cover of Johnny O'Keefe's "Wild One" (here titled "Real Wild Child (Wild One)" and three original songs co-written with ex-Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones. The remaining tracks were co-written by Bowie, who also produced the album with David Richards but, unlike his previous work with Pop, The Idiot and Lust for Life (both 1977), did not sing or play any instruments. Bowie biographer David Buckley has reported that Pop "virtually disowned" the record, calling it "a Bowie album in all but name".[3] It has never been specified what tracks on the album, if any, originated during the sessions of Bowie's 1984 album Tonight (that album's co-producer, Hugh Padgham, has recalled that Bowie and Pop collaborated on some songs that Bowie ultimately rejected for inclusion on Tonight).[citation needed] Described by Allmusic as "the most calculatedly commercial album of Iggy's career",[4] Blah Blah Blah was certified gold in Canada (more than 50,000 copies sold) and reached top ten status in many European countries. In the U.S. it peaked at #75 on Billboard's Top 200 Albums chart.[5] Rolling Stone's contemporary review complained of a "nagging homogeneity to side one" but continued that "even at its most familiar, Blah-Blah-Blah is as spiritually outraged and emotionally direct as commercial pop gets these days".[6] "Real Wild Child" reached #27 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock charts and became Pop's first top ten hit in the UK.[7] The song was featured on the soundtrack for the 1990 film Pretty Woman,also Problem Child 1 and 2, and has been the theme song of the Australian TV music program rage since 1987. Other singles and videos from the album included "Cry for Love," "Isolation" and "Shades". "Cry for Love", described by Rolling Stone as "a ripping fusion of classic Iggy rage, Bowie cabaret and unexpected romantic vulnerability",[6] made #19 on Billboard's Hot Dance Music chart and #34 on the Mainstream Rock charts.[7] All tracks written by Iggy Pop and David Bowie except where noted.
