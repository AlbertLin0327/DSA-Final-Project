Roy Roman www.royroman.com is a high note trumpet player who has performed lead with Lionel Hampton, the Benny Goodman Orchestra, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Hope, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Franki Valli, among others. Roman began playing the trumpet at age 19. After an injury to one of his front teeth, he was introduced to Roy Stevens www.roystevens.org, the teacher of a scientific method of embouchure development pioneered by William Costello. Today, Roman is the world's leading expert on the Stevens/Costello Method, a technique that allows the player to increase range, endurance and control.
