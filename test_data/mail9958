Eight Step Rail is the Debut EP released by Australian band The Superjesus in May 1996. The track I'm Stained was later re-recorded for their debut album, Sumo. A re-recorded version of Shut My Eyes was also later included as a hidden track on Sumo. The big guitar sounds are yet another use of the infamous Sansamp from Tech 21. After the engineer (Mick Wordley of Mixmasters Studios in Adelaide, Australia) spent a day trying to get a big sound out of Marshall stacks, he couldn't go past the sound the band had achieved by direct injecting a Sansamp into their Fostex recorder[citation needed].
