Subject: List of viscounts in the peerages of Britain and Ireland 
To: Chris
Content:
This is a list of present Viscounts in the Peerages of England, Scotland, Great Britain, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Note that it does not include those still-extant viscountcies which have become merged (either through marriage or elevation) with more elevated peerages and are today only seen as subsidiary titles. For a more complete list, which adds these "hidden" viscounties as well as extinct, dormant, abeyant, and forfeit ones, see List of Viscountcies. The general order of precedence among Viscounts is: but the viscountcies of Ireland created after the Acts of Union 1800 yield precedence to older United Kingdom viscountcies; one of these post-Union Irish viscountcies is older than any viscountcy of the United Kingdom, one other remains as a viscountcy, two are extinct, and one is now a subordinate title. The Viscount Monck, promoted in the first week of January 1801, does not fall under the restrictions of the Act of Union, and is earlier than all United Kingdom peerages.
