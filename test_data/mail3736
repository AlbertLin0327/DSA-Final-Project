CB Estudiantes (Spain) (20032006) Sergio Rodriguez Gomez (born June 12, 1986 in Tenerife, Canary Islands) is a Spanish professional basketball player. He is currently playing for Real Madrid. His NBA nickname is "Spanish Chocolate", a homage to flashy NBA player Jason "White Chocolate" Williams and which was acquired after the junior European tournament in which Rodrguez displayed his spectacular passing and ball-handling abilities. Prior to joining the Trail Blazers, Rodriguez was chosen to play for the 2004 World Junior Select team to play against the best high school players at the Nike Hoop Summit, located in the United States. Before joining the NBA, Rodrguez also played professional basketball at the senior club level for CB Estudiantes of the Spanish ACB league, in which he played a final against Barcelona FC in 200304 season and won the ACB Rising Star Award for the 200405 season. Rodrguez was selected with the 27th pick in the first round by the Phoenix Suns in the 2006 NBA Draft (and later that day traded to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for cash considerations). On July 20, 2006, it was announced that the Trail Blazers had negotiated a buyout with his Spanish club CB Estudiantes, and signed him to an NBA rookie-scale contract. On June 25, 2009, Rodrguez was traded along with the 38th pick in the 2009 NBA Draft and cash considerations to the Sacramento Kings for the 31st pick in the 2009 NBA Draft.[1] On February 18, 2010, Rodrguez was traded to the New York Knicks along with Tracy McGrady in a 3-team trade deal.[2] On July 5, 2010, after spending four seasons in the NBA, Rodriguez signed a 3-year contract with Real Madrid.[3] Thought to be one of the best European prospects of his age, Rodrguez was named the MVP of the 2004 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship, which was held in Zaragoza, Spain, while playing with the Spanish national junior team. He led the host Spanish team to the tournament's gold medal. In the eight games of that tournament, he averaged 19 points per game, 4.6 rebounds per game, 8.5 assists per game and 2.1 steals per game. In August 2006, Rodrguez won the gold medal at the 2006 FIBA World Championship while playing with the senior Spanish National Team. He also won the silver medal with Spain's senior national team at the 2007 European Championship. 4 Tomi | 7 Pocius | 8 Surez | 9 Reyes | 12 Miroti | 13 Rodrguez | 14 Velikovi | 16 Begi | 20 Carroll | 22 Singler | 23 Llull | Coach Laso
