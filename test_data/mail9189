A Makura-Nage (Japanese: , ) is a game from Japan in which children throw pillows at each other. A typical occasion to play it is after the futons are prepared (especially after the official lights-off time) in summer camp. While a pillow fight mainly takes the form of beating each other with pillows, Japanese Makura-Nage is a game in which players mainly throw pillows to each other. The word "makura" means "pillow", "nage" means "throwing". There were no rules for Makura-Nage, but today some Japanese ryokan hold Makura-Nage Games () for advertisement. In many manga and anime, a Makura-Nage scene creates a nostalgic atmosphere when describing children.
