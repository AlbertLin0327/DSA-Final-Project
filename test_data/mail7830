Adam Contessa (born 29 December 1976) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with the Western Bulldogs in the Australian Football League (AFL). Contessa, who played reserves level football at North Melbourne, made his debut for the Western Bulldogs in 1997. After making just five appearances in two years, Contessa was delisted by the club at the end of the 1998 AFL season, only to be given a second chance when they re-drafted him.[1] He was used in a variety of roles by coach Terry Wallace, including as a tagger, and was a semi regular member of the team in 1999. After missing the first two games of the 2000 season with a virus, Contessa played the remaining 21 games, including an elimination final.[2] He averaged just under 15 disposals for the year but could not continue that form in 2001 and was once again delisted. Also a talented cricketer, Contessa is captain of Royal Park Brunswick in the Victorian Turf Cricket Association.
