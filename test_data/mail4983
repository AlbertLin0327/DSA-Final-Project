The band was formed in September 1990 by bassist Fred, who went to Strasbourg looking for musicians with whom he could form a death metal band. He quickly found Olivier (vocals), Stphanie (drums) and David (guitar), and the band formed under the name Inhumate. After a year, Stphanie and Olivier left the band and were replaced by Valentin (drums) and Sbastien (vocals). With this line-up, the band became more grindcore-orientated and recorded its first demo, Abstract Suffering, in 1993. In 1994, Valentin and Sbastien left the group and were replaced by Yannick (drums) and Christophe (vocals). This line-up remained stable and more focused on grind. In May 1995, they recorded their second demo, Grind Your Soul.
