Hard to Be a Rock'N Roller.. In Kiev! is the third album by the Norwegian modern glam metal group Wig Wam. Released on March 15, 2005 the album is effectively a re-issue of their second album, "Hard To Be A Rock 'N' Roller", with the exception of "In My Dreams" replacing the radio edit of "Hard To Be A Rock'N Roller". The album gets the "In Kiev!" part of its name from Wig Wam's participation in the 2005 Eurovision Song Contest, which was held in Kiev. The album was released in Norway, as well as Finland and Sweden.
