Benkove ostrovy is group of twelve islets (0.6 ha) which are located in the Gabkovo water reservoir south of Bratislava, west from Kalinkovo village. They were built in the years 2006 and 2007 as part of flood protection for the Slovak capital, Bratislava. The islets, and their structure, were proposed and built to facilitate breeding waterbirds which have few possibilities for breeding after the construction of the Gabkovo water reservoir in 1992. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
