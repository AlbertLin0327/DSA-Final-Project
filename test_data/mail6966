Ute Park is an unincorporated community in Colfax County, New Mexico, United States. It was formerly part of the Maxwell Land Grant.[1][2] Ute Park lies on U.S. Route 64 between Cimarron and Eagle Nest, New Mexico, just east of Cimarron Canyon State Park. In 1921, the Guide to New Mexico[3] described it as: Ute Park was named for the Ute Indians, who lived on the east slope of near-by Mt. Baldy. The rebellious Ute resisted their white oppressors, and an Indian Agency and military force were maintained at Cimarron to keep them subdued, until they were finally moved to a reservation in southern Colorado and Utah. The village of Ute Park, opposite the mouth of Ute Creek, is the terminus of an A.T.&S.F. railway branch and is a distributing point for freight for Moreno Valley, Red River and Taos.[4] The Santa Fe Railway abandoned the Ute Park branch circa 1942. Portions of the right of way are still visible, but most railroad structures have been removed.
