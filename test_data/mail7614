The 20092010 UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics is a multi race tournament over a season of track cycling. The season runs from 30 October 2009 to 24 January 2010. The World Cup is organised by the Union Cycliste Internationale. The World Cup kicks off in Manchester, Great Britain then moves to Melbourne, Australia from 1921 November. As in the previous season, there are also rounds at the Alcides Nieto Patio Velodrome in Cali, Colombia from 1011 December 2009 and in Beijing, China from 2224 January 2010.
