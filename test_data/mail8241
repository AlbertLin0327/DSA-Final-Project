Crodino is a non-alcoholic bitter aperitif, produced by Gruppo Campari since 1995. It is an orange colored drink made of herbal extracts and sugar, and it is sold in 6 oz bottles. It is a popular drink in Italy and other European countries. The name Crodino derives from a comune in the province of Verbano Cusio Ossola, Crodo, Italy, where it has been bottled since 1964. It is used to make sixteen rum, a cocktail of Piedmont.
