Marine Tiltrotor Operational Test and Evaluation Squadron Twenty-Two (VMX-22) is a United States Marine Corps tiltrotor squadron consisting of MV-22 Osprey transport aircraft. The squadron, known as the "Argonauts", is based at Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina. VMX-22 stood up in August 2003 and reports to the Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR), who in turn reports test data and results to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Director, Operational Test and Evaluation. VMX-22 is an independent test organization under the operational control of COMOPTEVFOR and administrative control of the Deputy Commandant for Aviation with the charter to: The squadron provides a solid framework for MV-22 operational testing and lays the groundwork for a long-term "Tiltrotor Center of Excellence." Flight-testing of the MV-22 Osprey was delayed in the aftermath of the two incidents in 2000 and resumed in May 2002 to address the mechanical issues raised by these accidents. Included in the now on-going testing process is a rigorous, strictly regimented inspection process to verify and validate all of the aircrafts modifications and clearances. The Integrated Test Team at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Edwards Air Force Base, VMX-22, and the Bell Helicopter facility in Amarillo, Texas, have flown more than 4600 hours in the MV-22. Since the MV-22 is neither a fixed-wing nor rotary-wing platform, it has a unique designation as a tiltrotor. The aeromechanics, composite structure, maintenance concepts, and concept of deployment are inherently unique and best addressed in a squadron solely focused on tiltrotor operational testing.
