Herman Slough is a fork of Castro Creek in Richmond, California.[1] The stream is largely culverted and picks up water from storm drams throughout the Iron Triangle District.[1] The creek once was fed by rainwaters.[1] A portion remains in its original state alongside the Chevron Richmond Refinery.[1] 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
