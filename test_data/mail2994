Nicodemus, Hereditary Prince of Lwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg (Nicodemus Hieronymus Alois Georg Hubertus Mario Hugo Eusebius Maria; 2 August 2001) is the heir to the House of Lwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg.[1] Nicodemus was born in Oslo, Norway as the second child and eldest son of Carl Friedrich, Hereditary Prince of Lwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg and his wife Stephanie von Brenken.[1] At the time of his birth, his father was heir to House of Lwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. They lived in Oslo until 2002, when they moved to Bavaria.[2] Nicodemus currently lives with his family at Schloss Laudenbach in Laudenbach, Bavaria, Germany.[3] On 24 April 2010, Nicodemus' father, HSH Hereditary Prince Carl Friedrich of Lwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg, died in a car accident during the third VLN-long-distance championship of 2010.[2] Nicodemus consequently became the heir to his grandfather, Alois-Konstantin, 9th Prince of Lwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg, assuming the title Hereditary Prince of Lwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg.[2]
