Natural yttrium (Y) is composed of only one isotope 89Y. The most stable radioisotopes are 88Y which has a half-life of 106.65 days and 91Y with a half-life of 58.51 days. All the other isotopes have half-lives of less than a day, except 87Y, which has a half-life of 79.8 hours, and 90Y, with 64 hours. The dominant decay mode below the stable 89Y is electron capture and the dominant mode after it is beta emission. Twenty-six unstable isotopes have been characterized. 90Y exists in equilibrium with its parent isotope strontium-90, which is a product of nuclear fission. Standard atomic mass: 88.90585(2) u
