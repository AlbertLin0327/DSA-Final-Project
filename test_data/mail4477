Rabbit Fever is a 2009 feature-length documentary film directed by Amy Do, about the competition at the 2005 National Convention of the American Rabbit Breeders' Association (ARBA), the largest assemblage of rabbits in the world.[1] The film has found support from, among others, the Ignatz Award-winning artist Jeffrey Brown, who illustrated the movie poster.[2] It was shown at the 8th San Francisco Documentary Film Festival in October 2009 as a work-in-progress.[3] The final work will officially premiere in 2010.
