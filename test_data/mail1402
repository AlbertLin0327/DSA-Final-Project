The oruh River or Ch'orokhi River (Georgian:  ch'orokhi, Turkish: oruh, Armenian: , Tchorokh, Greek: , Akampsis) rises in the Mescit Mountains in north-eastern Turkey, flows through the cities of Bayburt, Ispir, Yusufeli, and Artvin, along the Kelkit-oruh Fault, before flowing into Georgia, where it reaches the Black Sea just south of Batumi and a few kilometers north of the Turkish-Georgian border. In Arrian's Periplus Ponti Euxini, it is called the  Acampsis; Pliny may have confused it with the Bathys.[2] In English, it was formerly known as the Boas, the Churuk, or the Chorokh.[3][4] The oruh valley lies within the Caucasus ecological zone, which is considered by the World Wild Fund for Nature and by Conservation International as a biodiversity hotspot.[5][6] The oruh Valley is recognised by Turkish conservation organisations as an important plant area,[7] an important bird area,[8] a key biodiversity area[9] and has been nominated as a high priority area for protection. This valley is rich in plants and contains 104 nationally threatened plant species of which 67 are endemic to Turkey.[7] The oruh has been called "an eco-tourism gem" and "Turkey's last remaining wild river", and is being promoted for whitewater kayaking by the Eastern Anatolia Tourism Development Project.[10] It attracts kayakers and rafters from all over the world and was the site of the 2005 Coruh Extreme kayak competition.[11] A total of 13 hydro-electric dams are planned as part of the oruh River Development Plan[12] but a total of 27 are proposed for the oruh River Catchment. Under the oruh Development Plan, 2 dams have been completed (Murtli Dam and Tortum Dam), another is under construction (Deriner Dam) and Yusufeli Dam, just upstream is in its final planning phase.
