Yongchang Town (Chinese: ) is the new county seat of Beichuan Qiang Autonomous County in Mianyang, Sichuan, China, one of the worst-hit area in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. It is between Yong'an Town (Chinese: ) and Anchang Town (Chinese: ) of An County, about 23km from the former county seat of Beichuan. It is named after the two towns as "Yongchang Town", which means "eternal prosperity" in Chinese. Construction will be carried out in there, including housing, schools, government building and hospitals.[1]
