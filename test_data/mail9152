Borovci is a settlement in the Markovci municipality in northeastern Slovenia. It is a roadside village on the Ptuj to Ormo regional road. It is first mentioned in written documents dating to 1458 as Worofcze. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Styria. It is now included with the rest of the municipality into the Podravje statistical region.[2] Two small roadside chapels in the settlement date to the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[3] Administrative centre: Markovci
