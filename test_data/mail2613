8: Ski Bradford (also known as Bradford Ski Area) is a small ski area located in the Bradford section of Haverhill, Massachusetts. Currently, Ski Bradford contains 13 trails: 2 green circles (easiest), 4 blue squares (intermediate) and 7 black diamonds (difficult) including a terrain park. According to USGS topographical maps[1], Ski Bradford is part of Dead Hill which has a summit elevation of 272 feet (83m). Ski Bradford currently has a fairly large terrain park. The park changes every year but there is always a mini halfpipe set up, several rails including an A-frame rail and box, 2 or 3 down rails, and 2 small boxes for beginners. Their setup usually has one large kicker and then a few small ramps here and there. Overall it is a very nice setup for a ski area that small. Ski Bradford currently contains eight operating lifts. Sources online, including their own website, currently do not provide the current, accurate lift information. As of March 2007 the lift information is as follows: [1] Ski Bradford has a large teaching staff and lesson programs. Dozens of schools are involved in after school ski clubs where many of the children involved partake in an hour long lesson every week. The capacity is there that 30 lessons can be run simultaneously per hour and even more for after school programs where hour long lessons begin every half hour between 3 and 5 PM. Walk-in lessons are also extremely popular at the area as many guests are spontaneous customers who had not planned in advance for a day of skiing but may have been encouraged to ski by good weather etc. Coordinates: 424437N 710332W / 42.74361N 71.05889W / 42.74361; -71.05889
