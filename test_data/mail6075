Like the other open electorates, it came into being in 1999 and was used for the parliamentary elections of 1999, 2001, and 2006. It covers the Town of Lami, in the greater Suva metropolitan area. In the following tables, the primary vote refers to first-preference votes cast. The final vote refers to the final tally after votes for low-polling candidates have been progressively redistributed to other candidates according to pre-arranged electoral agreements (see electoral fusion), which may be customized by the voters (see instant run-off voting).
