Keuthonymos (or Ceuthonymus[1]) () is the an ancient Greek spirit in mythology who is the father of Menoites (or Menoetes, Menoetius)[2][3] who guarded the oxen of Hades.[1] Keuthonymos is a mysterious Daimon or spirit of the Underworld, who lives in the realm of Hades. Keuthonymos is possibly the same as Iapetos, a Titan, and father of a certain Menoitios.[3]
