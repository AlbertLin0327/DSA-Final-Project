For Al Ain's Brazilian striker Andr Dias, see Andr Felippe Seixas Dias. Andr Gonalves Dias, or simply Andr Dias (born May 15, 1979 in So Bernardo do Campo), is a Brazilian football central defender. He currently plays for Lazio.[1] Andr Dias first entered senior football in the 1999 Copa So Paulo de Juniores, when he played for Palestra de So Bernardo. In the same year, Dias was signed by Paran, where he played for a year before moving to a bigger side, Flamengo. Dias stayed with Flamengo only for a short time, making ten appearances before moving again, this time to Paysandu Sport Club. Following a year at Paysandu, the defender moved to Gois, where he established himself as a strong and talented defender. In 2005, after two seasons at Gois, Dias moved to play for So Paulo. He remained there until the end of the 2009 season.[2] Dias secured his a move to Europe on 1 February 2010, when he signed for Italian club Lazio for 2.63 million euro.[3] He made 12 Serie A appearances with them in his first season.[2] In 2009, Dias was called up to the Brazilian national side by the manager Dunga, to face Chile in a 2010 World Cup qualifier.[4] He did not make his debut, however.
