Hyacinthe Yves Philippe Potentien, baron de Bougainville (1781  1846) was a French naval officer. He was the son of Louis-Antoine de Bougainville.[1] He became Rear-Admiral on 1 May 1838. As a young second-class midshipman of eighteen Hyacinthe de Bougainville participated in the 1800-02 Baudin expedition to Australia.[2] Hyacinthe de Bougainville sailed around the world from 1824 to 1826 onboard Thtis and Esprance,[1] sent by the Minister of the Navy and the Colonies, the duc de Clermont-Tonnerre.[3] On 12 January 1825, Hyacinthe de Bougainville led an embassy to Vietnam with Captain Courson de la Ville-Hlio, arriving in Da Nang, with the warships Thtis and Esprance.[4] Although they had numerous presents for the Emperor, and a 28 January 1824 letter from Louis XVIII, the ambassadors could not obtain an audience from Minh Mng.[5] Hyacinthe de Bougainville infiltrated Father Regreau from the Thtis when it was anchored in Da Nang, triggering edicts of persecution against Christianity by Minh Mng.[6] Bougainville visited New South Wales in 1825. That same year, he visited Port Jackson[7] and Sydney where he set up a monument to La Prouse in Botany Bay.[8] Journal de la Navigation Autour Du Globe de la Frgate Thtis et de la Corvette L'Esprance (Paris: Arthus Bertrand) 1837.
