Atlantis is the eleventh studio album by Norwegian hard rock band TNT. It was released on September 22, 2008. The album was much more well received than The New Territory, with many Norwegian outlets giving it 5 or 6 out of 6, European metal review site Hard Rock Haven giving it 8.1/10. However, Melodic Rock gave it a significantly less enthusiastic review of 69%, though the reviewer did state it was better than The New Territory. German newspaper reviews have been detracting.
