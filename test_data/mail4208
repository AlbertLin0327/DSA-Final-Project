The 111th Infantry Division (111. Infanterie-Division) was a unit of the Imperial German Army in World War I. The division was formed on March 25, 1915 near Brussels, Belgium and organized over the next several weeks.[1] It was part of a wave of new infantry divisions formed in the spring of 1915. The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was formed primarily from the excess infantry regiments of regular infantry divisions which were being triangularized. The division's 221st Infantry Brigade was formerly the 38th Infantry Brigade of the 19th Infantry Division, which came to the new division along with the 73rd Fsilier Regiment. The 76th Infantry Regiment came from the 17th Infantry Division. The 164th Infantry Regiment was formerly part of the 20th Infantry Division. The 73rd Fsiliers and the 164th Infantry were Hanoverian regiments, and the 76th was the regiment of the Hanseatic City of Hamburg. Cavalry support came in the form of two squadrons of Baden's 22nd Dragoons. The artillery and combat engineer units were newly formed. The 111th Infantry Division entered the line on the Western Front in the region between the Meuse and Moselle Rivers in April 1915. It fought in several engagements, and was then transferred to the front in the Flanders and Artois region. The division fought in the battle by La Basse and Arras in June 1915, and in the Battle of Loos in September and October 1915. It remained in positional warfare in the Flanders and Artois region into 1916, and fought in the Battle of the Somme. The division remained in the trenchlines in the Somme region into 1917. In April and May, it fought in the Battle of Arras. Later in the year, it fought in the Battle of Passchendaele, also known as the Third Battle of Ypres. In 1918, the division participated in the German Spring Offensive, fighting in the First Battle of the Somme (1918), also known as the Second Battle of the Somme (to distinguish it from the 1916 battle). It remained in the line except for brief respites until the end of the war. Allied intelligence rated the division as second class.[1][2] The 111th Infantry Division was formed as a triangular division. The order of battle of the division on March 25, 1915 was as follows:[3] The division underwent relatively few organizational changes over the course of the war. Cavalry was reduced, artillery and signals commands were formed, and combat engineer support was expanded to a full pioneer battalion. The order of battle on May 1, 1918 was as follows:[4] Guards: 1st 2nd Cavalry Regular: 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 10th 11th 12th 13th 14th 15th 16th 17th 18th 19th 20th 21st 22nd 23rd 24th 25th 26th 27th 28th 29th 30th 31st 32nd 33rd 34th 35th 36th 37th 38th 39th 40th 41st 42nd Bavarian: 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th Guards: 3rd 4th 5th 1st Guards Reserve 2nd Guards Reserve Guards Ersatz Cavalry: 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th Bavarian Infantry: 50th 52nd 54th 56th 58th 83rd 84th 86th 87th 88th 89th 91st 92nd 93rd 94th 95th 96th 101st 103rd 105th 107th 108th 109th 111th 113th 115th 117th 119th 121st 123rd 183rd 185th 187th 192nd 195th 197th 199th 200th 201st 202nd 203rd 204th 205th 206th 207th 208th 211th 212th 213th 214th 215th 216th 217th 218th 219th 220th 221st 222nd 223rd 224th 225th 226th 227th 228th 231st 232nd 233rd 234th 235th 236th 237th 238th 239th 240th 241st 242nd 243rd 255th 301st 302nd 303rd Reserve: 1st 3rd 5th 6th 7th 9th 10th 11th 12th 13th 14th 15th 16th 17th 18th 19th 21st 22nd 23rd 24th 25th 26th 28th 30th 33rd 35th 36th 39th 43rd 44th 45th 46th 47th 48th 49th 50th 51st 52nd 53rd 54th 75th 76th 77th 78th 79th 80th 81st 82nd Landwehr: 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 7th 8th 9th 10th 11th 12th 13th 14th 15th 16th 17th 18th 19th 20th 21st 22nd 23rd 25th 26th 38th 44th 45th 46th 47th 48th 85th Ersatz: 4th 5th 8th 10th 19th Naval: Naval 1st 2nd 3rd Bavarian infantry: 10th 11th 12th 14th 15th 16th Bavarian reserve: 1st 5th 6th 8th 9th 30th 39th Bavarian Landwehr and Ersatz: 1st 2nd 6th Ersatz Other: Alpenkorps Deutsche Jger Ostsee
