Robin Drysdale and Van Winitsky were the defending champions but only Winitsky competed that year with an unknown player. The unknown and Winitsky lost in the first round to Colin Dowdeswell and Peter McNamara. Ion iriac and Guillermo Vilas won in the final 64, 76 against John Sadri and Tim Wilkison. Champion seeds are indicated in bold text while text in italics indicates the round in which those seeds were eliminated.
