The Ludlow Metro-North Railroad station serves the residents of the Ludlow Park neighborhood of Yonkers, New York via the Hudson Line. The station is the southernmost on the Hudson Line before entering The Bronx. Trains leave for New York City every 25 to 35 minutes on weekdays. It is 13.6 miles (21.9km) from Grand Central Terminal and travel time to Grand Central is about 32 minutes. As of August 2006, daily commuter ridership was 250 and there are 33 parking spaces.[1]  The station has two high-level platforms each eight cars long. The west one is an island platform generally used by southbound or Manhattan-bound trains. The east one is a side platform generally used by northbound or outbound trains. The Hudson Line has five tracks here. The west platform is between Tracks 4 and 6, but only Track 4 carries Metro-North passenger trains. (Track 6 is not powered and used by freight trains.) The east platform is next to Track 3. The two inner tracks not next to either platform are used by express trains. Coordinates: 405526N 735420W / 40.9238N 73.9056W / 40.9238; -73.9056
