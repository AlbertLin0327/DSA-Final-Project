The Middle River is a tributary of the Des Moines River in south-central Iowa in the United States. It is 123 miles (198km) long[1] and drains an area of 489.5 square miles (1,268km2).[2] Via the Des Moines River, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River. The Middle River rises in southwestern Guthrie County and initially flows southeastwardly through Adair County, then eastwardly through Madison County, then east-northeastwardly through Warren County, passing the towns of Casey, Winterset, Patterson, Bevington, Martensdale, Spring Hill and Carlisle.[3] A substantial portion of the Middle River's course through Warren County has been straightened and channelized.[3] It joins the Des Moines River in Warren County near Carlisle, 13 miles (21km) southeast of Des Moines.[4] A short headwaters tributary of the river is known as the South Fork Middle River.[5]
