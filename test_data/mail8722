The New Calvinism is a growing perspective within conservative Evangelicalism that embraces the fundamentals of 16th century Calvinism while also trying to be relevant in the present day world. In March 2009, TIME magazine ranked it as one of the "10 Ideas Changing the World Right Now."[1] Some of the major movers in this area are John Piper,[1] Mark Driscoll,[1] Al Mohler,[1] Mark Dever,[2] C.J. Mahaney,[3] Joshua Harris[3] and Tim Keller. [4] Following the heritage of Reformed, or Calvinist, theology, New Calvinism strives to be deeply interested in the correct doctrine. In a Christianity Today article, Collin Hansen describes the speakers of a Christian conference: While Calvinism holds firmly to a belief in the monergistic sovereignty of God, the New Calvinists look to Puritans like Jonathan Edwards who taught that sanctification requires a vigorous and vigilant pursuit of holy living, not a passive attitude of mechanical progress.[5] Mark Driscoll lists four main differences between Old and New Calvinism:[6] This fourth distinctive is what Driscoll considers a vital component in being able to engage with the present day society.[7] R. Scott Clark, professor of church history and historical theology from Westminster Seminary California, argues that New Calvinists like Driscoll should not be called Calvinists merely because they believe in the five points of Calvinism, but rather he suggests that adherence to the Three Forms of Unity and other Reformed confessions of faith is what qualifies one a Calvinist. Specifically, he suggests that many of the New Calvinists' positions on infant baptism, covenant theology, and continuation of the gifts of the Spirit are out of step with the Reformed tradition.[8] J. Todd Billings, professor of Reformed Theology at Western Theological Seminary argues that the New Calvinists "tend to obscure the fact that the Reformed tradition has a deeply catholic heritage, a Christ-centered sacramental practice and a wide-lens, kingdom vision for the Christian's vocation in the world."[9]
