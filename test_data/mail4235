Delhi Daredevils (Hindi:  ) is the Delhi franchise of the Indian Premier League in cricket. The franchise is owned by the GMR Group. Founded in 2008, the team is currently captained by Virender Sehwag and coached by former South African cricketer Eric Simons. They play all their home matches at the historic Feroz Shah Kotla Ground. During the franchise auction for the Indian Premier League teams, the GMR Group purchased the Delhi Daredevils for $84 million. The Daredevils dominated for much of the 2009 IPL under the captaincy of Gautam Gambhir, finishing at the top of the table after the league stages despite a mid-tournament injury to icon player Virender Sehwag. AB de Villiers and Tillakaratne Dilshan both had developed greatly since the last season and set up many large totals for the Daredevils, with de Villiers hitting one of only two centuries in the 2009 IPL. The bowling, which in 2008 was composed mainly of overseas players (Maharoof, Vettori, McGrath, Asif) was bolstered by a trade to gain former Team India paceman Ashish Nehra in exchange for Shikhar Dhawan. Pradeep Sangwan and Amit Mishra had both improved since last season, and the offseason signing of Dirk Nannes from Australia created a bowling lineup that was strong. In fact, the Daredevils left the likes of Vettori, Collingwood and McGrath on the bench for most of the tournament, preferring to go with the overseas combination of Nannes, de Villiers, Dilshan and David Warner. However, despite dominating for the regular season, the Daredevils crumbled in the semi-final under a fierce batting assault by Adam Gilchrist, who hit the fastest fifty in IPL history (just 17 balls). Nannes in particular, who was again picked over McGrath, was punished by Gilchrist and later by Andrew Symonds. The disappointing semi-final meant Delhi did not contest the final of the 2009 IPL despite having the best record in the league stages. However, Delhi managed to qualify for 2009 Champions League Twenty20 because of their performance in group stage. Delhi was the table topper or the league topper in 2012. Morne Morkel of Delhi was the highest wicket taker of the tournament. Delhi came third in the tournament and qualified for the second time in champions league. Iconic Australian pace bowler Glenn McGrath expressed disappointment over not being picked to play any match during the whole season, and has since then stopped playing for Delhi.[2][3] Due to the disbanding of Kochi Tuskers Kerala, each team will play the remaining eight teams twice, once at home and once away. Therefore each team will play an extended season of 16 matches. The Daredevils play their home matches in the Feroz Shah Kotla ground located in New Delhi, under the newly installed floodlights. Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar was the brand ambassador of the team during the 2008 Season but opted not to return for the 2009 season due to a busy schedule. However, Akshay was seen at a few of the team's games cheering them on. Famous Bollywood playback singer Kailash Kher has sung the team anthem - "Khel Front Foot Pe" a.k.a. " Play on the front foot or play aggressively". It is played at every Delhi Daredevils match. Delhi Daredevils launched their new anthem "Munday Dilli Ke" on 5 March 2012 on the social networking site YouTube.[4] Virender Sehwag has been accorded the icon player status in the Delhi Daredevils team and was also the captain of the side during the first two seasons. However, he resigned and passed on the leadership to his opening partner Gautam Gambhir for the 2010 season. But after Gambhir left the team for Kolkata Knight Riders in the fourth edition,Sehwag was once again given the duty to captain the team. Since the start of the IPL in 2008 many international players such as Glenn McGrath, AB de Villiers, Tillakaratne Dilshan, David Warner, Andrew McDonald, Daniel Vettori, Farveez Maharoof, Dirk Nannes and Aaron Finch have donned the cap for the Daredevils. The team also included Indian players like Dinesh Karthik and Yo Mahesh. IPL 2009 Additions: Mohammad Asif and Shoaib Malik went out due to the ban on Pakistani players and Asif's positive drug test. David Warner, Andrew McDonald were the new signings. Ashish Nehra came in from Mumbai Indians as a trade-off for Shikhar Dhawan. IPL 2009 Auction Addition: Paul Collingwood USD 275,000 Owais Shah USD 275,000 IPL 2010 Trade off: Moises Henriques came in from Kolkata Knight Riders as a trade-off for Manoj Tiwary and Owais Shah.
