Going bare is a slang term for practicing medicine in Florida without medical malpractice insurance. Florida Statute 458.320 sets forth the financial responsibility requirements for medical doctors (MD) and doctors of osteopath (DO). (1) So long as the physician agrees to satisfy any judgment rendered up to limits set forth in the statute, there is no requirement that the physician purchase medical malpractice insurance. A requirement of "going bare" is that the physician post a sign containing the following language in their office waiting room: Under Florida law, physicians are generally required to carry medical malpractice insurance or otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility to cover potential claims for medical malpractice. YOUR DOCTOR HAS DECIDED NOT TO CARRY MEDICAL MALPRACTICE INSURANCE. This is permitted under Florida law subject to certain conditions. Florida law imposes penalties against noninsured physicians who fail to satisfy adverse judgments arising from claims of medical malpractice. This notice is provided pursuant to Florida law.
