HMNZS Moa (T233) was a Bird class minesweeper of the Royal New Zealand Navy. On 29 January 1943, with her sister ship Kiwi, Moa helped ram and wreck [1] the Japanese submarine I-1. At the time Moa was under the command of Lieutenant Commander Peter Phipps, later Vice Admiral Sir Peter Phipps. On 7 April 1943, Japanese aircraft sank Moa at Tulagi Harbour in the Solomon Islands. The ship sustained a direct hit from a 500-pound bomb and sank within four minutes. Five ratings were killed and seven were seriously wounded.[2] Moa was the first of two boats with this name to serve in the Royal New Zealand Navy and was named after a native bird from New Zealand.
