Joseph Pope Balch (August 9, 1822  December 2, 1872) was an American businessman from Rhode Island who served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Balch was an educated man, but decided upon a career in business instead of attending college, first working in his father's drug store at the age of 14 as a clerk, and eventually becoming a partner. In 1841 he joined a militia unit known as the Providence Marine Corps of Artillery, by 1857 Balch had risen to command of Rhode Island's Second Militia brigade. At the outbreak of the war, he was appointed to the rank of major in the First Rhode Island Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Balch succeeded to command of the regiment when its previous commander, Colonel Ambrose Burnside was promoted to command of a brigade. At the First Battle of Bull Run Balch was recognized for "coolness, steadiness, and courage under fire", and promoted by brevet to Brigadier General of the volunteers. When the regiment was disbanded, Balch returned to the militia and commanded the Second Militia brigade until the close of the war. After the war, Balch was a prominent member of Rhode Island society, and had six daughters and a son. He held membership in civic organizations including the Rhode Island Society for the Encouragement of Domestic Industry, and the Providence Franklin society. He died suddenly in his home from an internal hemorrhage in 1872.
