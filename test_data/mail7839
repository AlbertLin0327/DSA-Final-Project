The Paul Londershausen House in Dayton, Oregon, United States was built in 1921. It is also known as the Walters Residence and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[1] It is one block away from the Gottlieb Londershausen House. Both houses were listed on the NRHP with the same name, Londerhausen House, in 1987.[1]
