Franois de Candia, 1st Vidominus or Vidame de Geneva (1290 Chambery 1363 Ventimiglia) was lawyer, diplomat and a nobleman of the House of Candia; also known as Franois de Genve. From 1314 to the 26th of December 1360 he was "Vidomne de Geneve"; and military commander of the Prince-Bishop of Geneva, under the Catholic Lordship of the Knights of the Swiss Kingdoms of the Priory of Sion (Sitten) and member of the House of Savoy by his mother. "Vidominus di Ginevra" In his early military career, young count Franois fought for the protection of the Alpine passages and in 1377 was Captain of the Castle of the Rhone River (capitaine du chteau de l'Ile sur le Rhne). Though he originally began his military career to serve his land, later heirs to the Vice-Count lordship of Geneva gave him the chance to develop great diplomatic skills, and gained legal control over territories and strategic mountain passes in the Alps. In the following years, Franois de Candie had the honour of being chosen one of the masters of the Most Noble Order of the Priory of Geneva. He attended the needs and diplomatic duties of the Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy and the Prince-Bishop of Geneva of the House of Savoy in dealings with neighbouring Duchies. This caused the great powers such as France, England, Germany and Spain crowns to take the Vice-Counts opinions into account. Note: His hereditary title of Vice-Count of Geneva was active and held by the de Candi family until the referendum of the Swiss Protestant Reformation, from them on became an honorary title of the descendants registered in the Kingdom of Sardinia-Savoy. In accordance with the records of his higher education at the Monastery of the Bishop of Sion by-the-Alps, Franois de Candie was versed in Roman and Catholic canon law, and fluent in various languages such as French, Italian, German, Latin and Greek. He was well known by his analytic mind and distinguished by his diplomatic strategies. Franois de Candie, was registered in Italian as Franco de Candia-Savoia, a lord from the noble family of the Castle of Candia in Chambery-Le-Vieux (chteau de Candie) in the Duchy of Savoy descendant of a Burgundian dynasty of the Alps region; what is today part of Switzerland, France and Italy. Parented by a powerful couple, he was the son of Count Giacomo de Candia di Savoia, Lord of Bresse, Baron of Loeso, Count of Ventimiglia, and his wife Batrice de Savoy, princess of Geneva, called Beatrice of Bg, daughter of Amadeus V of Savoy and Sybille of Bg or Bugey daughter of the Burgundes. Giacommo his father lost his life in the confrontations of the Bugey and Bresse, while Franois was young student, making his mother's second husband Manfred III, Marquess of Saluzzo a dedicated mentor along his career since Franois was the only son of the couple; as recorded by his tutors at the Monastery of Sion.
