Fanboys 'n Da Hood is the first studio album released by The great Luke Ski under the name "Luke Ski's Psycho Potpourri" in 1996. This album has been out of print since 2003, and many of the tracks have since been re-released on later compilation collections. Some tracks were re-recorded for later studio albums, as some of the original recordings used karaoke tracks of the songs parodied as backing music, and backing vocals of the original lyrics were sometimes audible through the parody vocals.
