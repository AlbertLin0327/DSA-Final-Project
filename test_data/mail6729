The Willard Asylum for the Chronic Insane is a building complex in Willard, New York, near Seneca Lake. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The property once included farmland that was farmed by the residents. Some of that property is now included in Bonavista State Park Golf Course.[2]
