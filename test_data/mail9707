At the 2006 census, its population was 10,851, in 2,934 families.[2] It is located southwest by road from Isfahan. It contains the mausoleum of Muhammad ibn Bakran, a Sufi saint who taught theology outside the existing structure at the site.[citation needed] The iwan was constructed to serve as his classroom, but was not yet completed at the time of his death in 1303. The structure was later modified to function as his mausoleum. The ancient cemetery of the Jews of Esfahan is situated at front of this complex. It contains tombs inscribed from the 2nd century AD. The most notable tomb is that attributed to the biblical person Serah bat Asher.
