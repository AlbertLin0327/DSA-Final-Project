This is a list of sovereign states and other territories by population, with population figures estimated for 1 July 2005 (rounded to the nearest 1,000). The figures are estimates for the year 2005 from the U.N. World Population Prospects (2004 revision) using the medium fertility variant.[1] The list includes all sovereign states and dependent territories recognized by the United Nations plus the territory under the effective control of the Republic of China (Taiwan). For a graphical version of this list, see List of countries by population (graphical).
