Conus mazei, common name Maze's cone, is a species of predatory sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails, cone shells or cones. This is a western Atlantic species. Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of "stinging" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all. The shell of this species is very elongate with an unusually high spire. The shell color is whitish with brown dot markings that can be almost square in shape. The maximum recorded shell length is 59 mm.[1] Conus mazei is a very consistent species, displaying little variation throughout its range. This is a deepwater species. Minimum recorded depth is 152 m.[1] Maximum recorded depth is 549 m.[1]
