The 1993 Miami Dolphins' season was the 28th for the franchise and 24th in the NFL. The season was marked by Don Shula becoming the winningest coach in NFL history, passing George Halas against the Philadelphia Eagles. Also, during the Week 5 game against Cleveland, quarterback Dan Marino ruptured his Achilles' tendon and was lost for the remainder of the season. Quarterback Scott Mitchell filled in for Marino, and was Player of the Month for October 1993. Mitchell, too, became injured, leaving the team in the hands of Doug Pederson and NFL veteran Steve DeBerg. Rookie running back Terry Kirby led the team with 75 pass receptions, and free-agent acquisition Irving Fryar caught 64 passes for 1,010 yards.[1] The Dolphins had a record of 9-2 on Thanksgiving Day, but lost their final five games of the season, missing the playoffs altogether.
