Altes Lager (German for "Old Camp") is a site 1,5km south of the Menzlin village near Anklam, Western Pomerania, Germany. The site at the banks of the river Peene was an important Viking trade post during the Middle Ages (Viking Age). By that time, Pomerania was inhabited by Slavic Wends, yet several Viking trade posts were set up along the coast (the next were Ralswiek to the West and Jomsborg/Wollin to the east). The settlement had an approximated size of 18 hectares in the 9th century. Remnants of a bridge and a cemetery were excavated. Some artifacts found in the graves originated in Ireland and the Baltic states. Following Scandinavian customs, the dead were buried either in stone ships, i.e. ship-like graves, or within stone circles. The graves excavated so far have been found to be the tombs of women. Most findings date back to the 9th and 10th century. The ancient name of the site is unknown. Altes Lager, the current name, dates back to Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg's 1676 siege of Anklam.
