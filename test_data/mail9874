LG Gangnam Tower (Korean GS), also called LG Kangnam Building, is a 38-story (173 meters) modern skyscraper located in the Gangnam-gu area of Seoul, South Korea. Part of the corporate headquarters for LG Corp, a major Korean conglomerate, the building was completed in 1997 and is a mixed-use facility consisting of an art hall, performing arts theatre, corporate exhibition hall, offices, retail, restaurants, health club and parking. Given the LG Arts Centers location within the building and urban neighbourhood, close to the Seoul subway lines and major roads it was designed to provide a soundproof space.[2]
