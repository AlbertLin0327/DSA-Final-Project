Norwegian Meteorological Institute (Norwegian Meteorologisk institutt) or met.no is the Norwegian national institute for weather forecasts. The three main offices are located in Oslo, Bergen and Troms. The Institute has around 500 employees and keeps around 650 paid observers of various kinds around the country. The Institute operated the last remaining weather ship in the world, M/S "Polarfront", located in the North Atlantic, until it was discontinued due to budgetary issues January 1, 2010 and replaced with existing satellite and buoy data. The Norwegian Meteorological Institute was founded in 1866 with the help of Norwegian astronomer and meteorologist Henrik Mohn who served as director until 1913. He is credited with founding meteorological research in Norway. The Institute represents Norway in international organizations like the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and EUMETSAT. The Institute is also partner to a number of international research and monitoring projects including EMEP, MyOcean, MyWave and the North West Shelf Operational Oceanographic System. The institute with its three branches in Oslo, Bergen and Troms provide weather forecasts for Norway and Norwegian waters as well as more specialized services such as ice monitoring, oil spill and search and rescue forecast services. Marine forecasts of sea state parameters are issued both commercially to oil companies and more generally for the public. The free online service Yr, launched in 2007, provides weather forecasts for both Norway and the rest of the world. The institute is responsible for maintaining, quality checking, archiving and updating the observational network consisting of automated weather stations, radiosondes and weather radars. The marine observations of wave height and other oceanographic parameters gathered by petroleum platforms in Norwegian waters are also archived by the institute. The institute produces operational weather forecasts using different numerical weather prediction models including the Unified Model and HIRLAM. The forecasts are subject to modifications introduced by human forecasters before being issued. The institute also runs a suite of operational ocean models ranging in resolution from 20 km to less than 1 km. The model suite currently comprises both the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) as well as the more recent Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS). The wave model WAM has been in operational use since 1998 on a number of grid resolutions ranging from 50 km down to 4 km while the SWAN model has been implemented for coastal high-resolution (less than 1 km grid resolution) applications.
