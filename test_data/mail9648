The Miracle at the New Meadowlands,[2][3] also called "New Miracle at the New Meadowlands[4] and "Miracle at the Meadowlands III"[5] is the term used by sportscasters and Philadelphia Eagles fans to refer to an improbable come-from-behind win by the Philadelphia Eagles over the New York Giants on December 19, 2010 at MetLife Stadium, which in the 2010 season went by the name New Meadowlands Stadium as the naming rights had not yet been sold to MetLife. The Eagles had been manhandled by the Giants for the first three quarters and trailed by 21 points with under eight minutes to play in the 4th quarter. They went on to score four unanswered touchdowns in the final seven minutes and 28 seconds of play. The final score to win the game, 3831, came off a punt returned for a touchdown by DeSean Jackson as time expired. Jackson became the first player in NFL history to achieve a walk-off punt return touchdown. The game ranked at #1 among the top 20 games of the 2010 NFL regular season.[6] The Giants won the toss and chose to receive, but their first possession resulted in a punt after going three-and-out. The Eagles offense took the field for the first time, with the ball spotted at their own 29 yard line. After an incomplete pass, QB Michael Vick threw a pass intended for WR DeSean Jackson, but it was picked off by CB Corey Webster who returned it to the Philadelphia 42 yard line. The Giants were unable to capitalize on the turnover, as LB Moise Fokou sacked QB Eli Manning putting them out of field goal range and forcing them to punt. After the Eagles failed to get anything going on the ensuing drive, the Giants put together a 71-yard scoring drive that ended with Manning finding WR Mario Manningham for a 35-yard touchdown pass to put the Giants on the board, leading 70. Near the end of the quarter S Quintin Mikell picked off Manning's pass to WR Derek Hagan and ran it back to the Giants 45-yard line. The final play of the first quarter resulted in a run by Vick for 11 yards and a personal foul called on T Jonathan Goff which moved the ball to the Giants' 19-yard line. The Eagles' drive carried over from the previous quarter. A completed pass and a run moved the Eagles to the 12-yard line. But on third down, Vick was sacked for a 4-yard loss by DT Rocky Bernard, forcing Philadelphia to settle for a 34-yard field goal from K David Akers. The Giants received the ball and started at their own 21 yard line, whereupon they put together a 8-play, 79-yard drive. RB Ahmad Bradshaw ran three times for 24 yards. The drive ended on Manning's second touchdown pass to Manningham, this one for 33 yards putting the Giants in the driver's seat, 143. The Giants once again stopped the Eagles on their next drive and received the ball. Two passes to Hagan for 27 yards and 11-yard run by Bradshaw helped the Giants get to the Eagles 7-yard line. The Giants were unable to score on third down because of an incomplete pass to TE Kevin Boss. The Giants settled for a 25-yard field goal from K Lawrence Tynes to make the score 173. The Eagles tried to get something going on the next drive and it appeared they did when Vick found WR Jeremy Maclin, but the ball came loose before he hit the ground. S Kenny Phillips recovered it and ran it to the Philadelphia 8-yard line. The Eagles called a timeout to try and get the replay assistant to take a look at the play since it was now under two minutes in the half, but the play was reviewed and it was determined to be a fumble. The Giants took advantage of this and on the next play, Manning found WR Hakeem Nicks for an 8-yard touchdown pass putting the Giants in total control at halftime 243. After the first drives of the quarter by both teams failed, the Eagles received the ball and tried to drive downfield. They got to the Giants' 42 before two costly penalties on TE Brent Celek forced them to punt. On the next drive, Manning found Manningham but the ball came loose and DT Mike Patterson recovered it for the Eagles on the Giants 25-yard line. After a run and a pass, Vick threw a 8-yard touchdown pass to Maclin to make the score 2410 and keep the Eagles in the game. Both teams punted once in the opening minutes of the fourth quarter, giving the Eagles the ball with 12:48 remaining in the game. With first down at the 20-yard line, Vick dropped back and passed to Jackson, who advanced to the Eagles' 49-yard line before losing the football as he hit the ground. The Giants' Kenny Phillips picked up the loose ball and advanced it to the Eagles' 47-yard line. Replays showed that LB Jonathan Goff touched Jackson's jersey as he was falling, meaning that the call on the field of a fumble was incorrect. However, Eagles head coach Andy Reid neglected to challenge the call on the field and the Giants took possession. On third down and 4 from the Eagles' 8-yard line, Manning hit Boss in the back of the end zone to give the Giants a 31-10 lead with 8:17 remaining in the game. After opening up the next drive with a pass to Maclin that brought the Eagles to their own 35-yard line, Vick dropped back and completed a pass downfield to Celek, who blew by a missed tackle from Phillips and made his way into the end zone for a 65-yard touchdown that brought the score to 31-17 with 7:28 left in the game. On the ensuing kickoff, after both teams lined up in regular kickoff formations, Akers placed an onside kick on the left side of the field, which was caught by WR Riley Cooper and advanced to the Eagles' 43-yard line. Particularly noteworthy about the play was the fact that the Eagles only had 10 men on the field - four to Akers' right and five to his left  and that the Giants' front line of blockers on the return was lined up 15 yards away from the tee, rather than the usual 10. It was unclear whether the Eagles intentionally had only 10 men on the field, as Giants special teams captain Chase Blackburn stated after the game that he believed it was on purpose. On the second play of the ensuing drive, Vick escaped a New York blitz and rushed all the way down to the Giants' six-yard line. After two incomplete passes, with an offsides on Tuck in between, Vick ran the ball into the end zone on third and goal from the four-yard line, making the score 31-24 with 5:28 left in the game. A short kickoff by Akers and a good return by RB DJ Ware gave the Giants the ball on their own 35-yard line, and a pass from Manning to Manningham and three straight runs by Bradshaw gave the Giants two first downs, forcing the Eagles to use all three of their timeouts. However, on second and six from the Eagles' 38-yard line, T David Diehl committed a false start penalty, backing the Giants up to second and 11. A three-yard run by Bradshaw and an incomplete pass by Manning on third down left the Giants just outside Tynes' range for a field goal and forced the Giants to punt. The ensuing fair catch by Maclin gave the Eagles the ball at their own 12-yard line with 3:01 remaining in the game. After two incomplete passes to begin the drive, Vick escaped a blitz by scrambling to his left for 33 yards before stepping out of bounds at the Eagles' 45-yard line. A pass to Avant and another scramble by Vick set the Eagles up at the 20-yard line at the two-minute warning. Facing second and three from the 13-yard line, Vick passed to Maclin on the left side, and Maclin shook a tackle from CB Terrell Thomas and reached the end zone, tying the game at 31-31 with 1:16 remaining. Once again, Akers' kick and Ware's return placed the Giants in good field position, with Manning beginning the drive at the Giants' 36-yard line with 1:10 left. However, the drive began with two incomplete passes, and after a third-down sack by DT Trevor Laws put the Giants at their own 29-yard line, the Giants called a timeout as the play clock was about to expire on fourth down with 12 seconds left. Officials then ruled to reset the game clock to 0:14 as the Giants' punt team and the Eagles' punt return team came onto the field. The snap from long snapper Zak DeOssie to Punter Matt Dodge was high, and Dodge hastily kicked a line drive punt to Jackson rather than kicking the ball out of bounds. Jackson received the ball at the Eagles' 35-yard line and immediately muffed the catch before picking the ball up and backpedaling to the 30-yard line. Jackson ran through a group of Giants and made it to midfield before receiving a huge block by WR Jason Avant on DeOssie, leaving no one in front of Jackson on the way to the end zone. Ware followed Jackson but could not catch him. After the clock hit 0:00, Jackson ran parallel to the goal line across most of the width of the fieldaccording to Jackson after the game, because he wanted to be sure the clock had expired, though some observers believed it to be due to his showboating nature  before advancing into the end zone for the game-winning touchdown. With no flags on the field, Jackson threw the ball into the New Meadowlands stands in celebration as the team gathered around him near the end zone. Giants head coach Tom Coughlin was so livid he threw his play sheet and notes onto the ground and ran onto the field before Jackson even reached the end zone, yelling at Dodge for not punting the ball out of bounds. Per NFL rules, Akers came out to kick the extra point and the Eagles won the game 38-31. at New Meadowlands Stadium, East Rutherford, New Jersey The following is the call of the final play of the game from Joe Buck on FOX. "And DeSean Jackson, who has averaged, 14th-best in the NFL, 8.7 yards per return, has not returned one for a touchdown this year...waits. (Dodge gets the snap, slightly above his head, and gets the kick off) "And it's a line drive kick." (Jackson drops the ball at the 35-yard line, picks it up, and backpedals to the 30) "Jackson...bobbles it, and now has to try and recover." (Jackson breaks through a group of Giants to the Eagles' 45-yard line) "DeSean Jackson..." (Jackson reaches midfield, at which point Avant blocks DeOssie at the Giants' 46-yard line) "GETS A BLOCK! ARE YOU KIDDING! DeSean Jackson..." (Jackson runs down the sideline, arm in the air, before running parallel to the goal line, looking over his shoulder, and stepping into the end zone) "...still not in and now in for the touchdown, no flags! Un-believable! No time left! Eagles win!"[7] Eagles broadcasters Merrill Reese and Mike Quick called the play on WYSP-FM in Philadelphia this way:[8][9] "Fourteen seconds to go. 31-31. Matt Dodge to punt, gets a high snap, gets it away, it's a knuckler. Jackson takes it at the 35, fumbles it, picks it up, looks for running room. He's at the 40, he's at the 45, midfield (Mike Quick: OH!), he's at the 40 (OH!). He's going to go! DeSean Jackson (OH!)! I don't care if he jumps, dives, he's running around and he's in the end zone, and there's no time, and the Eagles win! The Eagles win! (Quick:) This is Miracle at the Meadowlands Number 2! Miracle in the New Meadowlands, baby!"

In the following week, the Packers defeated the Giants, 45-17, enabling Philadelphia to clinch the NFC East division title, and increasing Green Bay's chances of making the playoffs instead of New York. Despite the miracle win, it would be their last win of the season as the Eagles lost their next three games, including a Wild Card playoff game against the Packers.[15][16] Though the Giants won their week 17 matchup against the Washington Redskins, they failed to qualify for the playoffs since the Packers, who also finished the season at 10-6, won the tiebreaker.[17] Before the 2011 season began, Matt Dodge was released by the Giants and is not currently on any team's active roster.
