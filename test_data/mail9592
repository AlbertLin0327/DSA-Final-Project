The Richard Pratt Cup is a trophy awarded to the winning team in annual games between AFL clubs Collingwood and Carlton. The Richard Pratt Trophy is named after Richard Pratt, former Carlton president, following Pratt's death in April 2009 due to complications from prostate cancer.[1] The match in which the game is played serves as a fundraising event for the Pratt Foundation. The first Richard Pratt Cup match was played on Round 17, 2009, and has been contested annually since. Carlton and Collingwood will always play two home-and-away matches against each other, and the Carlton home match is always designated as the Richard Pratt Cup match.[2] The trophy is won by the club which wins this match. The Collingwood home match between the two clubs each season is played to contest the Peter Mac Cup, which is a similar event which raises funds for the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. The presentation of the trophy takes place in the rooms after the game.  Peter Mac Cup Carlton-Collingwood AFL rivalry Carlton Football Club Collingwood Football Club
