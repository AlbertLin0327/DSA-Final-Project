Alexandre Le Roy was born on 19 January 1854 in Saint-Senier-de-Beuvron, France, the son of Norman farmers.[1][2] Le Roy received a secondary education at the Abbaye Blanche in Mortain.[1] He went on to study philosophy at the Seminary of the Diocese of Coutances.[1] On 10 August 1876, at the age of 22, he was ordained a priest of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit.[2] After his ordination, he worked as an educator in the Collge Saint-Denis in Runion, the Collge de Cellule, France and Pondicherry, India.[1] Le Roy first traveled to Africa in 1881he accompanied an expedition to Bagamoyo, Tanzania, scouting for potential mission sites; he took the opportunity to write books and magazine articles, which were highly appreciated in Europe.[1] He was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Gabon on 3 July 1892, with a titular bishopric (Alinda); on 9 October 1892 he was consecrated as apostolic vicar, which he held until 24 May 1896.[2][3] On 24 May 1896 he was appointed Superior General of his order.
