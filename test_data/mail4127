Coordinates: 513531N 00835W / 51.592N 0.143W / 51.592; -0.143 Muswell Hill is a suburb of north London, mostly in the London Borough of Haringey. It is situated about 6 miles (10km) north of Charing Cross and around 8 miles (13km) from the City of London. Muswell Hill is in the N10 postal district and mostly in the Hornsey and Wood Green parliamentary constituency. The earliest records of Muswell Hill date from the 12th century. The Bishop of London, who was the Lord of the Manor of Harringay,[1] owned the area and granted 65 acres (263,000 m), located to the east of Colney Hatch Lane, to a newly formed order of nuns. The nuns built a chapel on the site and called it Our Lady of Muswell. The name Muswell is believed to come from a natural spring or well (the "Mossy Well"), said to have miraculous properties. The traditional story tells that a Scottish king was cured of disease after drinking the water of the spring/well. The area became a place of pilgrimage for healing during medieval times.[2] The River Moselle, which has its source in Muswell Hill and Highgate, derives its name from this district; it was originally known as the Mosa or Mosella.[3][4] In the 18th century Muswell Hill was a scattered village consisting mainly of detached villas with large gardens.[5] In 1787 one commentator wrote that nowhere within 100 miles (160km) of London was there a village so pleasant or with such varied views.[6] Little had changed by the middle of the 19th century. One of the houses of the time was The Limes. This house occupied the angle of Muswell Hill Road with Colney Hatch Lane and was a three-storeyed house with portico and two-storeyed wing approached by a double carriage drive through impressive gateways. The large grounds of the house extended to Tetherdown and included a lake.[7] Opposite The Limes was Muswell Hill pond and beyond that the Green Man inn, built of stone.[8] Further down the hill past the Green Man was the Elms a squat three-storeyed house later improved by Thomas Cubitt standing in 11 acres (45,000 m2), part of the grounds of which were laid out by Joseph Paxton.[9] A short distance down the north side of Muswell Hill was the Grove, which was three storeys high and had nine bays with pedimented projections at each end.[10] It stood in 8 acres (32,000 m2) of grounds which contained a 2000 yard avenue of oaks. In 1774 the house was occupied by Topham Beauclerk.[11] A little farther down the hill stood Grove Lodge, also in wooded grounds.[12] Altogether there were eight properties in Muswell Hill worthy of note in 1817.[13] Parallel with Muswell Hill was a track known as St. James's Lane which ran across a triangle of wasteland. By the middle of the 19th century houses were already dispersed along the lane at the foot of which was Lalla Rookh, a two storeyed villa with a wide verandah.[14] Other buildings there were apparently cottages or huts, both single and in terraces.[15] It was not until the end of the 19th century that Muswell Hill began to be developed more densely from a collection of country houses to the contemporary London suburb it is today. The development was spurred by the opening of a branchline railway with connecting services to Finsbury Park and Kings Cross stations. Most commercial development was initiated in the early 20th century when the current street pattern was set out and elegant Edwardian retail parades were constructed. The centre included a music hall (later demolished with the site redeveloped as a supermarket) and several churches for various denominations. The 1930s saw the construction of an art deco Odeon cinema. The site of the Ritz, a cinema formerly at the top of Muswell Hill, has been redeveloped as offices. Until the mid-20th century there was a rail branch line, the Muswell Hill Railway, from Highgate which passed through Muswell Hill, terminating at a station at Alexandra Palace. It was intended under the Northern Heights plan to integrate this into the London Underground Northern Line; some contemporary tube maps (e.g. the 1948 map) showed the line as being under construction. However, this plan was cancelled after the 1939-45 war, and the railway line was abandoned in 1954. The line was later converted to become the Parkland Walk. Until the reorganisation of London's local government in 1965, Muswell Hill formed part of the Borough of Hornsey within the administrative county of Middlesex. The area subsequently became part of the London Borough of Haringey. Close to Alexandra Park and Highgate Woods, Muswell Hill is a comfortable mainly Edwardian north London suburb. Muswell Hill Broadway and Fortis Green Road, the main shopping streets, still maintain their historic character with most of the original facades preserved above street level. The area has a synagogue and four churches, one of which has been converted into a bar. Some parts have very clear views over London. At the top of a hill, Muswell Hill is not directly served by any tube or other railway stations. Bus routes travel into the centre of London. They also connect the area to nearby underground stations at Highgate, Bounds Green, East Finchley, Finsbury Park and Turnpike Lane and to train services at Alexandra Palace and Hornsey. In December 2011, a digital town square was launched for the area of Muswell Hill. It is called MyMuswell [16]and is an ad-free, non-profit website designed to provide a virtual space for the area. It lists clubs, classes, places, tweets and runs articles on local issues. It can also be found on Twitter @mymuswell.[17] The nearest tube stations are:
