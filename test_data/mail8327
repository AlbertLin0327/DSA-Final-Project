Hail to the Buff and Blue is the official fight song of the George Washington University Colonials athletic teams. The song is played daily at 12:15pm and 6pm by the bells located atop Corcoran Hall, on the University Yard.[1] The song was composed in 1924 by then-student Eugene F. Sweeney for a contest to choose a new fight song. The University had recently changed its colors from orange and blue to buff and blue, and the original fight song, Orange and Blue, had become obsolete.[1] Patrick M. Jones re-wrote the fight song in 1989,[1] creating the current version taught to incoming freshmen at Colonial Inauguration and played at athletic events.[2] Hail to the Buff and Blue Hail to the Buff Hail to the Blue Hail to the Buff & Blue All our lives we'll be proud to say We hail from G - W (Go Big Blue!) Oh By George we're happy we can say We're G - W here to show the way So raise high the Buff (Buff!) Raise high the Blue (Blue!) Loyal to G - W You bet we're loyal to G - W Fight! The 1924 version related to the school's football team, which was ended in the 1960s. Hail to the buff Hail to the blue Hail to the buff and blue See our men go round their end Fighting for G double U When the sun sinks in the golden west Victory upon our team shall rest So raise high the buff; raise high the blue Touch-down for G double U[1]
