George Evans (10 March 1870  5 March 1915) known as "Honey Boy" Evans was a Welsh-born songwriter, comedian, entertainer, and musician active in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Evans was born in Pontotlyn, Wales in 1870.[1] In 1910, he bought the Cohan & Harris Minstrels organization for $25,000, that were known as the Honey Boy Minstrels.[1] Among other songs, he co-wrote "In the Good Old Summer Time". He had a well known minstrel show troupe, the "Honey Boy Minstrels". He debuted The Memphis Blues on vaudeville. Evans became a great baseball fan after moving to America as a young man. Beginning in 1908 he had a beautiful loving cup individually designed and given to the "World's Championship Batsman",the player having the highest batting average in all of Major League Baseball. Honus Wagner, the great Pittsburgh Pirate shortstop, won the initial award in 1908. Ty Cobb,the fabulous "Georgia Peach",swept the next 4 trophy's from 1909 to 1912. Evans stopped issuing the award in 1913.[citation needed] He died at Union Baptist Hospital in Baltimore of stomach cancer on 5 March 1915.[1]
