Its name comes from the colours that reflect off it in sunlight, but out of the glare of the sun it is a plain silver fish. Barbels are not present. Endemic in South Asia, it is found in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Myanmar. Like most Danionins, this fish has a tendency to jump. A tight fitting lid with no gaps is recommended for keeping them captive. Research in 2001 by Fang Fang suggests that the genus Chela is closely related to the Devarios.
