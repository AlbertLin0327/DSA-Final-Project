Karl von Krempler (26 May 1896, Pirot, Serbia  17 April 1971, Salzburg, Austria) was a senior SS Standartenfhrer and SS-und Polizeifhrer during World War II responsible for recruiting Muslims from Bosnia and the Sanjak region into the Waffen SS. Karl von Krempler was born on 26 May 1896 in Pirot, Serbia. He was the son of an Austrian engineer. In 1915 he volunteered as a cadet for the Lower Austrian Infantry Regiment No. 84 (k.u.k. Niedersterreichischen Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 84). In 1920 he was released from active serive with the rank of Lieutenant (Oberleutnant). He spoke fluent Turkish, Serbian and German. He was considered a specialist within the SS on Islam and in 1942 was recruited by Heinrich Himmler and Artur Phleps to participate in the formation of a proposed Bosniak Handschar Division within the Waffen SS, the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian). Unlike most SS personnel, Krempler was not a member of the Nazi Party. "On 3 March [1942], Phleps met with fellow SS officer Karl von Krempler, who, together with Croatian government official Dr. Alija uljak, was to conduct the recruiting effort. The campaign began on the twentieth, when the multi-lingual von Krempler and Dr. uljak, accompanied by several other dignitaries began an eighteen-day recruiting tour through eleven Bosnian districts." [1] Dr. Alija uljak and SS Standartenfhrer Karl von Krempler soon fell out over the aims and purposes of the proposed Division. The Bosniak doctor, an entirely political appointee, criticized von Krempler's spoken Serbian dialect and his use of traditional Islamic colours and emblems (green flags and crescent moons) rather than the new Ustae symbols during recruitment.[2] "Upon reaching Tuzla he [von Krempler] met with Major Hadiefendi, and on 28 March the pair departed for Sarajevo, where Hadiefendi introduced the German to leading Muslim autonomists, including the Reis-el-Ulema, Hafiz Muhamed Panda."[3] Major Muhamed Hadiefendi had been an important Muslim officer in the Yugoslav Royal Army and came from a distinguished family in Tuzla. Angry Ustae officials demanded that von Krempler be relieved of his duties and Envoy Siegfried Kasche of the Reich Foreign Affairs Ministry was also very critical of von Krempler's perceived interference in the internal affairs of Croatia. As he spoke Turkish von Krempler also helped liaise with and organise security for the visit to Bosnia by Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, over 30 March and 14 April 1942. (The Mufti was Arab but had served in the Turkish army during World War I). Croatian authorities tried to interrupt the visit but von Krempler was instrumental in arranging an interview between the Mufti and several Bosnian community leaders.[4] Following his appointment to the post of Hhere SS-und Polizeifhrer Sandschak (Higher SS and Police Leader Sanjak) in September 1943, von Krempler came to be known as the "Sanjak Prince" after his relatively successful formation of the SS und Polizei Selbschutz Regiment (or Self-Defense Regiment Sandschak). He went to the Sanjak region in October and took over the local volunteer militia of around 5000 anti-communist, anti-Serb Muslim men headquartered in Sjenica. This formation was sometimes thereafter called the Kampfgruppe Krempler or more derisively the "Muselmanengruppe von Krempler". As the senior Waffen SS officer Karl von Krempler appointed a token local Muslim named Hafiz Sulejman Pacariz as the formal commander of the unit, but as the key military trainer and contact person with German arms and munitions, remained effectively in control.[5] Krempler was replaced in June 1944 by SS Oberfhrer Richard Kaaserer, who commanded the Sandschak Regiment from 21 June 1944 to 28 November 1944. Kaaserer had been a member of the Austro-Hungarian Army in World War I. Unlike von Krempler, Kaaserer was extradited to Socialist Yugoslavia after the war, and was tried and executed in January 1947 for alleged war crimes. On 27 July 1944 he was awarded the Panzervernichtungsabzeichen (tank destruction medal). Yugoslav Partisans, equipped with Allied war material attacked and seized Sjenica over 1415 October 1944. The Kampfgruppe Krempler was effectively scattered: older men deserted or simply went home, whilst hundreds of younger men under the leadership of Pacariz travelled to Sarajevo where they joined up with the notorious Ustae Vjekoslav Luburi. (Pacariz was granted the rank of Pukovnik - leader - in the Ustae Militia.) Karl von Krempler and his small contingent of German training personnel were reassigned during the latter part of October 1944.[6] In January 1945 he was re-assigned to the administrative staff of the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian). Karl von Krempler escaped the Communist regime of Josip Broz Tito and died on 17 April 1972 in Salzburg, Austria.
