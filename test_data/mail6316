This article is about the American anime convention with the initials "AN". For the Canadian "AN", see Anime North. AnimeNEXT (AN) is an annual three-day anime convention held on a weekend in the New York / New Jersey metropolitan area, and is the ninth largest convention in the US.[1] The first event was held in 2002 in October, but later moved to June in 2004. The event is organized by Universal Animation, Inc., a non-profit organization incorporated in the state of New York. The convention features Japanese creators of anime and manga, voice actors from anime series, artists, vendors and exhibits, panels, workshops, and gaming.[1] Events all focus on aspects of anime, manga, and Japanese culture. With the popularity of anime and manga growing in the 1990s and 2000s, anime conventions have seen great growth in their attendance, and AnimeNEXT is no exception. AnimeNEXT was the first anime convention in the USA to employ a manga library.[citation needed] Here attendees enter a quiet room and submit their Convention Pass as a collateral to borrow a manga to read within the confines of the library. It has become popular[citation needed] and AnimeNEXT has taken their library on the road to other conventions.[13][14]
