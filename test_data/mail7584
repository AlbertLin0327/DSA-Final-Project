Benedikt Kgl (12 March 1891, city unknown, Germany- 29 April 1973 Munich, Germany) was a German artist and the elder brother of Albert Kgl. Benedikt was a miniaturist painter, working in oil, with cats and still lifes his main subjects. Some of his works were less than one inch square. His work is actively traded today in several galleries in the US and Germany. After World War I, Benedikt helped Albert immigrate to the US on the condition that Albert would not work as a professional artist. Benedikt felt that having two Kgls in the art world would make it financially difficult for both of them to make a living.
