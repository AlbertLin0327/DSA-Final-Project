Stephen Pollington is an English historian who specialises in the study of Anglo-Saxon England and the Old English language who has written a number of books on the subject, most of which have been published by the company Anglo-Saxon Books. In 2010, Pollington co-authored Wayland's Work: Anglo-Saxon Art, Myth and Material Culture 4th-7th Century with Lindsay Kerr and Brett Hammond. It received a positive review in Antiquaries Journal for its "synthesis of current knowledge."[1] The Council for British Archaeology's magazine British Archaeology, however, was largely critical of the use of "original research and non specialist summary."[2]
