Clover is a 1997 TV-movie that first aired on USA with Elizabeth McGovern, Ernie Hudson and Zelda Harris based on Dori Sanders' bestselling 1990 novel Clover. White Sara Kate (McGovern) marries Gaten Hill (Hudson), a black widowed father. Shortly after their wedding, Gaten dies in an auto crash. So Sara has to take care of Gaten's daughter, Clover (Harris). Problem is she and Clover have not exactly bonded and several of Gaten's friends and relatives object to her being Clover's guardian.
