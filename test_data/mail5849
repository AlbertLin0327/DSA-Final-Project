Carol Hanisch is a radical feminist and was an important member of New York Radical Women and Redstockings. She is best known for popularizing the phrase "The Personal is Political" in a 1969 essay of the same name. She conceived of the idea to protest against the Miss America Pageant in 1968. "The personal is political" The relationship between wife and husband is a class relationship and the conflicts between man and woman are political conflicts that can only be solved collectively.
