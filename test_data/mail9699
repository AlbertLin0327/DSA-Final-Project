Sultan Mahmud Bridge is a bridge in Kuala Terengganu, Terengganu, Malaysia, which crosses Terengganu River. Constructed in 1988, the bridge was officially opened by the late of Sultan of Terengganu, Almarhum Sultan Mahmud Al-Muktafi Billah Shah in 1990. Toll collection for the bridge was abolished in 1999 by the then PAS state government following an election promise.
