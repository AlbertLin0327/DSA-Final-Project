Alexander Kowalski (born 1978) is a popular German techno music artist.[1] Kowalski was born in 1978 in Greifswald, Germany, and was raised in Grimmen. In 1986 he moved with his family to Berlin, where he began his musical career. Early influences on his work were Joey Beltram and Synewave, though he was limited to using cheap instruments to emulate them. He performed his first live gig at the Tresor Club in Berlin, and soon thereafter got in contact with Pacou and Sender Berlin, eventually releasing his first track on Proton Records in 1999. That same year, Kowalski and collaborator Stassy from Sender Berlin debuted as the techno team Double X.[citation needed] Kowalski released his much acclaimed debut record Echoes in 2001, on the Kanzleramt label. He quickly produced a follow-up, Progress (early 2002), which brought him much greater notability in the electronic music scene.[citation needed] A year and a half after his breakthrough second album, he released Response, including the single "Belo Horizonte". He was nominated twice for the German dance award in 2003. After a break of three years, he switched record labels from Kanzleramt to Different.[citation needed] Aliases: DisX3, D Func, Double X (with Torsten Litschko).
