35007 ("Loose" in beghilos) is a band from the Netherlands. The sound of 35007 has elements of stoner rock, psychedelic rock, space rock and progressive rock. 35007 was formed in Eindhoven, The Netherlands at the end of the eighties and originate from The Alabama Kids. 35007's early line-up consisted of Eeuwout Baart (vocals), Mark Sponselee (sounds, synths), Bertus Fridael (guitar), Jacco Van Rooy (drums), Michel Boekhoudt (bassguitar), Luk Sponselee (vj) and Pidah Kloos (sounds, soundengineer). They released their debut album "Especially For You" in 1994. After the selftitled album "35007" Jacco van Rooy left the band and was replaced by Sander Evers on drums. In 2001 Eeuwout Baart also left and the band and 35007 continued as an instrumental unit. "Sea of Tranquillity" is the first of three instrumental releases. In 2005 the band, now with Tos Nieuwenhuizen from Beaver on guitar, released "Phase V" but was never seen on stage again. Their live shows were accompanied with visual effects, such as psychedelic videos projected on stage. In the years after "Phase V" Bertus Fridael starts his own band Mother-Unit, Sander Evers joins Gomer Pyle, Jacco van Rooy joined Motorpsycho for a short period of time and Tos Nieuwenhuizen performed live with Sunn O))). 35007 performed several times at the annual international Roadburn Festival in The Netherlands, as well as the other groups in which the former members of 35007 play.
