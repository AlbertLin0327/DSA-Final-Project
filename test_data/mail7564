The Pleasantville Music Festival is an annual music festival held at Parkway Field in Pleasantville, New York. First held in July 2005, it has been sponsored by rock radio station 107.1 The Peak (WXPK-FM) since 2006.[1] The festival is an all-day outdoor event administered by the Pleasantville Recreation Department and takes place in Parkway Field, normally the site of four ball fields. Each year the festival features over 150 volunteers. Main stage acts have included Roger McGuinn, The Bacon Brothers, Rusted Root, Jakob Dylan, Dar Williams, Carney, Back Door Slam, Marc Cohn, Augustana and Joan Osborne. There are three stages - the Main Stage, Village Stage, and the Beer & Wine Garden.
