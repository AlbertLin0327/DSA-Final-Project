Michel Warlop (January 23, 1911  March 20, 1947) was a French jazz violinist. He was a contemporary of Didi Duprat and of Stephane Grappelli, with whom he played often. Warlop was one of France's early native stars on the violin; he accompanied singers Maurice Chevalier and Germaine Sablon in the mid-1930s, and worked with Stephane Grappelli and Django Reinhardt from 1934 to 1937. In the second half of the 1930s he played in the Jazz du Poste Parisien and with accordionist Louis Richardet, as well as with Grappelli and Eddie South in 1937. He worked extensively with American expatriates, including Garland Wilson (with whom he recorded as a duo in 1938), and visiting musicians such as Coleman Hawkins. In the early 1940s he was a member of Raymond Legrand's orchestra, and he led his own string septet from 1941 to 1943. He composed the work Noel du Prisonnier (Christmas of a Prisoner) and premiered it as conductor with the Paris Symphony Orchestra in 1942. He died at the age of 36 in 1947.
