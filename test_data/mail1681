Nathaniel P. Wilkerson (born 1972) is a Canadian artist from the Gitksan First Nation in northwestern British Columbia, Canada. He is a member of the House of Amagyet, a Laxgibuu (Wolf clan) house. He studied the Haida art style, both drawing and carving under the tutelage of Freda Diesing from 1984 to 1985 at Terrace, B.C. One of these earliest pieces is permanently featured at the International Museum of Children's Art in Oslo, Norway.[citation needed] His work is reminiscent of the more traditional Haida/Gitksan style of artwork with heavy form lines and highly curvilinear elements. Most of his work follows the conventional, traditional style of the artwork, although it consistently offers a new perspective of common native themes. He is as of 2011[update] working with serigraph, copper, leather and wood (alder, red and yellow cedar).
