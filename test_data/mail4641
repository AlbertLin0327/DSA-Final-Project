The Kurobe Cable Car (, Kurobe Kburuk?), officially the Cable Line (, Ksaku-sen?), is a Japanese funicular line in Tateyama, Toyama, operated by Tateyama Kurobe Kank. The company also operates another funicular with the same official name. The line is a part of Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route. The line goes entirely under a tunnel to protect it from snow. It opened in 1969. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
