The Amazing Race 11 (also known as The Amazing Race: All-Stars) is the 11th installment of the reality television show The Amazing Race. The Amazing Race 11 featured eleven teams of two  ten returning teams from previous editions, and a dating couple who had met and competed against each other on a previous season  in a race around the world. The eleventh cycle premiered on February 18, 2007 at 8:00 p.m. EST, 7:00 CST for one hour,[1] and the season finale was on May 6, 2007.[3] Dating couple Eric Sanchez and Danielle Turner, who had competed on opposing teams on The Amazing Race 9, won this edition of the Race. As early as 2004, there had been talk about an all-star edition, with speculation that it would occur during the eighth season, just like Survivor. These rumors were fueled by reports that Season 4 winner Reichen Lehmkuhl had been invited to appear in a future all-star Race.[4] Speculation continued for the next few years, particularly after CBS aired all-star editions of their two other reality competition series Survivor and Big Brother.[5] On September 28, 2006 CBS ordered an 11th season of The Amazing Race;[6] in November 2006, the network officially acknowledged that an all-star edition was in production.[7] Host Phil Keoghan was originally skeptical that an all-star edition was feasible. Over time, Keoghan felt that "as we got more and more really good teams, it (All-Stars) just seemed like it had to happen."[8] Shortly after filming of the Race completed, approximately late December 2006, a detailed boot-list spoiler surfaced and quickly circulated among several Internet discussion boards.[9] The list showed a completely accurate elimination order, including the exact order of finish for the final three teams. This season was the second season (after season 5) to visit every inhabitable continent. The new countries visited in this season were Ecuador, Mozambique, Poland and Macao. None of those countries have been visited since. This was last season in the US series to feature the Yield. To date, this is also the last season that did not start or finish in Los Angeles. Six legs of this race were won by all-female teams (4 by Dustin & Kandice and 2 by Charla & Mirna) setting a record which would later be matched in season 17. This season's 11 teams were selected from past contestants, representing seven of the series' first ten editions (omitting Seasons 4, 6, and 8).[10] Keoghan personally submitted a list of 15 teams that he thought should return. Ten of them were chosen. The one he didn't choose was Eric and Danielle, who did not previously race together. Keoghan said, "I didn't think of that new combination, which actually is a really good one."[11] He also added that the production team's goal for the race "wasn't to pick the best racers", but "to pick the teams that have earned the most attention over the last 10 seasons".[8] (Despite the "All-Stars" title, only one team, Uchenna and Joyce, was a winner of a previous season.) Some former racers were angered by their omission from All-Stars, most notably Chip and Kim (Season 5) and BJ and Tyler (Season 9) who publicly criticized CBS' casting process.[12] Colin and Christie (Season 5) were expected to be in All-Stars but could not participate due to Christie's pregnancy.[13] Flo Pesenti and Drew Riker (who began dating after meeting on The Amazing Race 3) were invited to participate, but Flo reportedly declined for two reasons: she felt the first race had brought out the worst in her, and her TAR3 winning partner Zach Behr was not invited to join her. The newly created team for All-Stars thus became Eric and Danielle. Dustin and Kandice from Season 10 and Charla and Mirna from Season 5 became the 2nd and 3rd out of the 7 all-female teams (to date) to make the final 3 respectively. The full list of returning teams (and their prior race placements) are: This season introduced the Elimination Station feature on the official website. A series of 13 web episodes presented the eliminated contestants living together in a common house in their sequester location in Acapulco, Mexico. The series was viewable only in the United States and was available on the Innertube video streaming service on the CBS website, with a new episode debuting immediately following the airing of each new Amazing Race episode in the Pacific time zone.[14] The following teams participated in the Race, with their relationships at the time of filming. Note that this table is not necessarily reflective of all content broadcast on television due to inclusion or exclusion of some data. Placements are listed in finishing order: Episode titles are often taken from quotes made by the racers. Unless otherwise noted, prizes were awarded to the first team to check in for each leg. The first five teams eliminated were sequestered at a villa in Acapulco, Mexico to await the finale. Subsequent eliminated teams telephoned the villa to inform the teams at the villa of their elimination, but continued to run the race as decoys to throw off spoilers to the final outcome of the race. The sequestered teams met up with the decoy teams in the final destination city to cheer on the final three teams as they crossed the Finish Line CBS posted short videos on its website after each episode aired in the Pacific time zone to show the eliminated teams interacting at the villa. In the first Detour of the race, teams had to choose between Wrangle It or Recover It. In Wrangle It, teams had to help local cowboys lasso, tie down, and groom one wild horse whose hooves grow so long that they prevent them from walking properly. Team members had to use traditional tools to clip its hooves to a safe length and to trim its mane and tail. In Recover It, one team member had to put on an historical military uniform. Then, the team must search the field for three items missing from the uniform: an epaulette, a button and a sword. The Roadblock for this leg was to enter the ground floor boardroom and search the boardroom for letters of the alphabet that were on display. Teams needed to figure out that the majority of the letters when unscrambled would spell out one of the ten destinations inscribed on the plaques hanging on the wall. When they think they solved the puzzle, which was Chuquicamata, they had to show their answer to the security guard who would hand them their next clue if they were correct. The Detour was By Hand or By Machine. In By Hand, teams had to choose a two-ton tire and, by properly aligning the bolts and washers, finish securing it to a dump truck. In By Machine, each team member had to take a turn driving a huge front loader to transfer enough gravel to cover a marked yellow line on a stick. For the Roadblock on this leg of the race, one team member had to choose an 1800-gallon fish-breeding tank, jump in, and catch and transfer all 80 flounder from the breeding tank to a holding tank at the other end of the farm. Once finished, their clue would be revealed at the bottom of the tank. The Detour was a choice between Vertical Limit or River Wild. In Vertical Limit, teams had to walk 200 yards (200m) to a cliff where both team members needed to complete a 40-foot (12m) rock climb. Each team member would grab one half of their clue at the top of the climb. In River Wild, teams had to backtrack two miles (3km) to the banks of Rio Petrohu where they would complete a two and a half mile white water rafting course through level 3 and 4 rapids. Teams chose between Navigate It or Sign It for this leg's Detour. In Navigate It, teams had to use a map of Punta Arenas to get to the Plaza Muoz Gamero where a sailor would hand them a compass. Then, using the compass, the teams needed to walk directly south to find the Nautilus Building, a deep-sea salvage business. In Sign It, teams had to choose a pole and building supplies and carry them up a flight of stairs to Magellan's Map. Using the map as a reference, teams needed to figure out his journey around the world began and ended in Seville. Then, they had to build a traditional local signpost listing in order the fourteen ports of call in his voyage. While the signs didn't have to point in the right direction, all the cities had to be spelled correctly. The Roadblock on this leg was to sort through 1,600 pieces of mail and find one of two messages addressed to their team, written by one of the other teams from their season. The team member then had to read the message inside it to their partner, after which they received their next clue. For the Roadblock, one team member had to use a rat to find a race marker above a deactivated mine. Once their rat gave the signal that it found something, an Apopo Mine Technician would search the area. When the Race marker was found, the team would receive their next clue. This leg's Detour was Pamper or Porter. In Pamper, teams had to travel half a mile to the Maputo Central Market, choose a nail polish kit, and convince people to pay them to paint their nails, which in Maputo is a job usually performed by men. Teams needed to earn at least 30 meticals, which is about one U.S. dollar, to receive their next clue. In Porter, teams made their way two miles to Market de Janet where they would use their bare hands to fill 10 large 45-pound bags with coal and sew each of them shut. Then, teams had to carry one of the ten heavy bags to a specified address where the owner would hand them their next clue. The Detour for this leg was Solve It or Schlep It. In Solve It, teams had to make their way one third of a mile to the Beyt al Chai hotel where they would put together a 62-piece puzzle that recreates an image from a style of local artwork known as Tinga Tinga. In Schlep It, teams made their way one mile to the Kijangwani Lumber Yard. Once there, they had to choose a local handcart and load two 50-pound logs into their cart. Once loaded, teams had to travel more than a mile to deliver the logs to a shipyard. This leg's Roadblock had one team member learn how to use a traditional wooden weapon called a rungu used by members of the Maasai people by throwing it 65 feet (20m) to destroy clay targets in order to retrieve their next clue from inside. The Detour was Perfect Pitch or Perfect Angle. In Perfect Pitch, teams had to make their way three-quarters of a mile to the Prymas Palace and choose a grand piano. Then, they needed to use the provided tools to tune one key of the keyboard. Once the concert pianist played a piece of Chopin's music and determined that their piano was in tune, he would hand them their next clue. In Perfect Angle, teams made their way approximately half a mile to the Escada Boutique to pick up a mannequin and carry it another 400 yards (400m) to the Panoramik Laboratory. Once there, teams had to use an x-ray machine to locate a clue embedded somewhere inside their mannequin which needed to be positioned at a very specific angle for the image to capture the name of their next destination and commemorate Marie Curie. The unaired Roadblock required teams to row a boat out onto the reflecting pool in front of the palace. The objective is unknown. At the Intersection, teams had to join with one other team to complete tasks and make decisions together until further notice, including completing the Fast Forward. In this Fast Forward, teams had to climb a set of stairs up two different towers (the tower of St. Mary's Basilica and the Town Hall Tower located in the Main Market Square) and count how many stairs there were. They then had to add up the result and tell it to a guard, if correct, the two teams would win the Fast Forward. The Detour for this leg of the race was Eat It Up or Roll It Out. In Eat It Up, the intersected teams would make their way one and a half miles to an old market. Once there, each team member had to use traditional methods to make one three-inch length of Polish kiebasa (sausage). After finishing, the teams would be served eight feet of cooked kiebasa. Once each person ate two feet of sausage, the teams would receive their next clue. In Roll It Out, the intersected teams would make their way one and a half miles to the J. Mazurek bakery in the Old Jewish Quarter and properly roll out twenty bagels. When finished, they would make their way on foot one quarter of a mile to a nearby restaurant with a delivery of fresh bagels for the headwaiter. After the Detour, teams were no longer Intersected. In the Roadblock, one team member had to don a full suit of authentic medieval armor and lead a horse half a mile through the forest to the castle gates. Once at the castle, they had to deliver the horse to the stable boy, enter the courtyard, and search for the Pit Stop. The Detour for this leg of the race was a choice between Artistic Expression or Cookie Confection. In Artistic Expression, teams needed to travel one third of a mile on foot to Dewan Lama. Once there, they had to use an ancient technique known as batik to exactly duplicate one of three patterns onto and then dye a 45-square-foot (4m2) piece of cloth. In Cookie Confection, teams made their way on foot half a mile to Chow Kit Bomba and had to search through 600 boxes of traditional Malaysian festive cookies, by biting into them, and find the one cookie that had a black licorice center. The Roadblock on this leg of the race was a nod to Malaysia's eco-friendly practice of recycling. Team members had to choose a bicycle with a side cart attached and then scour the neighborhood Taman Sri Hartamas for residents willing to give them their used newspapers. Once they had collected enough newspapers to make a stack eight hands (approximately six ft) high, they would receive their next clue In the second of only two Fast Forwards on the race, teams had to travel 5 miles (8.0km) to a film set in New Kowloon located at the former Kai Tak Airport where a high-speed stunt was being filmed for an action movie. When they arrived, they had to get in a car with a professional stunt driver and complete a stunt course, involving sharp turns and the car flipping over. After completing the stunt course, the team would win the Fast Forward. This leg's detour was Kung Fu Fighting or Lost in Translation. In Kung Fu Fighting, teams had to travel 5 miles (8.0km) to Tonkin Street and find a nearby building (the former Cheung Sha Wan Police Quarters). Once there, they had to climb up an 11-story bamboo scaffold while avoiding an ongoing battle between stunt kung fu experts to reach the top and retrieve their next clue. In Lost in Translation, teams needed to make their way 4 miles (6.4km) to Kowloon City and find Nga Tsin Wai Road. Once there, they had to search among hundreds of similar-looking Chinese signs for the specific sign shown in a photo in their clue. When they matched the photo with the correct store sign, the owner would hand them their next clue. In the Roadblock for this leg, one teammate had to kick down doors, and search the rooms behind the doors for their clue. Right outside the elevator in the inner rim in Macau Tower was the second of two Yields in the race. In the Roadblock for this leg of the race, teams had to perform the world's tallest Skyjump, walking around the outer rim of the observation deck, and then take a tethered jump off of the tower. The Detour for this leg of the race was Noodle or Dragon. In Noodle, teams had to make two bundles of traditional Chinese noodles. In Dragon, teams had to carry a dragon head and drum and carry it  of a mile to Nam Van Lake to find the one dragon boat the dragon's head matched. In the Detour for this leg of the race, teams had to choose between Care Package or Engine Care. In Care Package, teams must fill a 500 pound package with various humanitarian aid items for a neighboring island. Once complete, the teams must then board onto a transport plane and participate in an air drop training exercise. Though easier, the mission would take at least half an hour. In Engine Care, teams had to clean an engine pod and associated flap section on the wing of a B-52 bomber until one of the base's sergeants feels the portion of the plane is clean enough. In the Roadblock, teams had to perform a search and rescue mission. Using a GPS receiver, team members had to find a pilot in the Guam forest, receive new GPS co-ordinates from him, locate the landing zone, and signal for a helicopter to pick them up and bring them back to the naval base. In the Detour for this leg of the race, teams had to choose between Under or Over. In Under, teams had to swim into a cave where their next clue would be anchored to the floor of the cave. In Over, teams had to use a paddle board to reach a buoy that had their next clue. Photos on the official CBS website suggest that the unaired Roadblock involved jumping off a cliff into the water below, as Mirna and Danielle were shown doing this task in the photos. Footage of Charla & Mirna approaching jeeps with the clue inside each jeep after their helicopter landed in Lanai suggest that the location of the Roadblock was most likely in Hawaii before the Detour, though the exact location is unknown.
