Mahlangr Himl (Nepali:  ) is a section of the Himalaya in northeast Nepal and south-central Tibet extending from the pass Nangpa La between Rolwaling Himal and Cho Oyu east to the Arun River.[1] It includes Mount Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, and Cho Oyu  four of Earth's six highest peaks. On the Tibetan side it is drained by Rongbuk and Kangshung Glaciers and on the Nepali side by Barun, Ngojumba and Khumbu Glaciers and others. All are tributaries to the Kosi River via Arun River on the north and east or Dudh Kosi on the south. Mahalangur Himal can be divided into three subsections: Khumbu is the best known populated part of the Mahalangurs since it is on the access trail to the normal (South Col) route up Everest.
