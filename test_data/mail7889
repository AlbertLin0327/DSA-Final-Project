Kaz is an American crime drama series that aired on CBS from September 10, 1978 to April 22, 1979.[1] Ron Leibman starred as Martin "Kaz" Kazinsky, a Polish American former convict who became a criminal defense attorney after he was released from prison. Leibman won an Emmy Award as Outstanding Lead Actor in a drama. Nevertheless, the show failed to capture an audience and was cancelled due to low ratings. In all, 22 episodes aired. Kaz finds himself in the middle of a murder case involving two old jam-session friends: the victim and his confessed killer.
