GB Class 1 was a series of four trams and two trailers built by Hannoversche Waggonfabrik for Graakalbanen of Trondheim, Norway. Each of the four Siemens motors had an effect of 50kW (67hp). There were two compartments, both with four-abreast seating, with reversible seats. Despite running in part in city streets, the trams were 2.6m (8.5ft) wide.[1] The trams were taken out of service in 1968 and 1969. Two of the trams and both the trailers were scrapped the same year. No. 4 was kept as a working car until it was scrapped in 1985. No. 3 is preserved as a heritage tram at Trondheim Tramway Museum.[2]
