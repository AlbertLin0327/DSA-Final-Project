The 20102011 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating was the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series of the 20102011 season. It was a series of six international invitational competitions in the fall of 2010 that built to the Grand Prix Final. Skaters competed in the disciplines of men's singles, ladies singles, pair skating, and ice dancing on the senior level. At each event, skaters earned points based on their placement toward qualifying for the Grand Prix Final. The top six scoring skaters or teams at the end of the series competed at the 20102011 Grand Prix Final, held in Beijing, China. The Grand Prix series set the stage for the 2011 European, Four Continents, and World Championships, as well as each country's national championships. The Grand Prix series began on October 22, 2010 and ended on December 12, 2010. The Grand Prix was organized by the International Skating Union. Skaters competed for prize money and for a chance to compete in the Grand Prix Final. The corresponding series for junior-level skaters was the 20102011 ISU Junior Grand Prix. Skaters who reached the age of 14 by July 1, 2010 were eligible to compete on the senior Grand Prix circuit. The top six skaters/teams from the 2010 World Figure Skating Championships were seeded and then guaranteed two events. Skaters/teams who placed 7th through 12th were also be given two events, though they were not considered seeded. Skaters and teams who were ranked in the top 24 in the world at the end of the 2009-2010 season and those who had an ISU personal best in the top-24 on the season's best list for the 2009-2010 season were also guaranteed one event. Skaters/teams who medaled at the 2009-2010 Junior Grand Prix Final or the 2010 World Junior Figure Skating Championships were guaranteed one event. Skaters who medaled at both the Junior Grand Prix Final and the World Junior Championships were guaranteed only one event. The host country was allowed to assign three skaters/teams of their choosing from their country in each discipline. The spots remaining were filled from the top 75 skaters/teams in the 2009-2010 season's best list. Skaters could not be given a Grand Prix invitation without having been on the season's best list, with the following exceptions: After the final event, the 2010 Trophe Eric Bompard, the six skaters/teams with the most points advanced to the Grand Prix Final. The point system is as follows: There are seven tie-breakers in cases of a tie in overall points: If there is still a tie, the tie is considered unbreakable and the tied skaters all qualify for the Grand Prix Final. * Boldface indicates qualifying for the Grand Prix Final.
