Radio Rwanda is a radio station of the Rwandan Office of Information (ORINFOR), a government information agency that also owns Rwandan Television (TVR). It played a large part in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. It encouraged Hutus to 'kill the Tutsi cockroaches' and told people that the Tutsis were the enemy. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
