The Trabant /trbnt/ is a car that was produced by former East German auto maker VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau in Zwickau, Sachsen. It was the most common vehicle in East Germany, and was also exported to countries both inside and outside the communist bloc. The main selling points was that it had room for four adults and luggage in a compact, light and durable shell; it was fast (when introduced); and it was durable. With its mediocre performance, outdated and inefficient two-stroke engine (which returned poor fuel economy for the car's size and produced heavy exhaust), and production shortages, the Trabant is often cited as an example of the disadvantages of centralized planning; on the other hand, it is regarded with derisive affection as a symbol of the failed former East Germany and of the fall of communism (in former West Germany, as many East Germans streamed into West Berlin and West Germany in their Trabants after the opening of the Berlin Wall in 1989). It was in production without any significant changes for nearly 30 years with 3,096,099 Trabants produced in total.[3] In 2008, Time magazine rated the Trabant as one of the 50 worst cars ever made.[4] The name, meaning 'satellite' or 'companion ' in German, was inspired by Soviet Sputnik.[5] The cars are often referred to as the Trabbi or Trabi, pronounced /trbi/ TRAH-bee in English. Due to the long waiting period between ordering a Trabant and actually taking delivery (in some cases years passed as scarce materials were obtained), people who finally received one treated the car gently and were meticulous in maintaining and repairing it. The lifespan of an average Trabant was 28 years.[6] Used Trabants would often fetch a higher price than new ones, as the former were available immediately, while the latter required the infamous long wait. There were four principal variants of the Trabant, the P50, also known as the Trabant 500, produced 19571962; the Trabant 600, produced 19621964; the Trabant 601, produced 19631991; and the Trabant 1.1 produced 19901991 with a 1,043cc (63.6cuin) VW engine (making the "1.1" a slight misnomer). The engine for the Trabant 500, 600 and original 601 was a small two-stroke engine with two cylinders, giving the vehicle modest performance. At the end of production in 1989 it delivered 19 kW (26 horsepower) from a 600cc (37cuin) displacement. The car took 21 seconds from 0 to 100km/h (62mph) and the top speed was 112km/h (70mph). There were two main problems with the engine: the smoky exhaust and the pollution it producednine times the amount of hydrocarbons and five times the carbon monoxide emissions of the average European car of 2007. The fuel consumption was 7l/100km (40mpg-imp; 34mpg-US).[7] Since the engine does not have an oil injection system, two-stroke oil has to be added to the 24-litre (6.3U.S.gal; 5.3impgal) fuel tank[8] every time the car was filled up, at a 50:1 or 33:1 ratio of fuel to oil. Gas stations of the time in countries where two-stroke engines were common served premixed gas-oil mixture from the pump. Today, owners normally carry a container of two-stroke oil in the car for this purpose. The earlier models have no fuel gauge; a dipstick is inserted into the tank to determine how much fuel remains. The Trabant was a steel monocoque design with roof, bootlid/trunklid, bonnet/hood, bumpers/fenders and doors in Duroplast, a hard plastic similar to bakelite made of recycled materials: cotton waste from the Soviet Union and phenol resins from the East German dye industry, making the Trabant the first car with a body made of recycled material.[6]. The results of some crash tests showed it performed better than some contemporary Western hatchbacks.[9][10][11] Because the car lacked a fuel pump, the fuel tank was placed high up in the engine compartment so that fuel could be fed to the carburetor by gravity; a trade-off of this design is an increased fire risk in front-end accidents. The Trabant was the second car to use Duroplast, after the "pre-Trabant" P70 (Zwickau) model (19541959). Production of the Trabant on April 30, 1991 reached 3.7 million vehicles. The Trabant was the result of a planning process that had originally been intended to design a three-wheeled motorcycle.[12] The name was chosen in an internal contest in 1957, the year of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite. In German, a 'trabant' is an astronomical term to denote a moon or other natural satellite of a celestial body.[citation needed] In its Slavic origin, it has the same meaning as the Russian word 'sputnik', namely 'companion'. Previous motorcycle production at Sachsenring had been under the aegis of AWZ (Auto-Werke Zwickau). The Trabant was a relatively advanced car when it was launched in 1958; with front wheel drive, a unitary construction, composite bodywork and independent suspension all around. The main letdown was the engine: by the late 1950s many small cars in western countries already used cleaner and more efficient four-stroke engines, as employed in the Renault, whereas budgetary constraints forced the use of a two-stroke engine in the Trabant. When released the Trabant was technically equivalent to the West German Lloyd automobile, which had an air cooled two-cylinder four-stroke engine in the same size vehicle. The Trabant's air cooled two cylinder 500cc (31cuin) (later 600cc) two-stroke engine was derived from a pre-war DKW design, with minor alterations being made throughout the car's production run. The first Saab car got a similar air cooled two cylinder engine. Wartburg, a GDR manufacturer of larger saloons, also used a DKW engine: a water-cooled 3 cylinder 1,000cc (61cuin) two-stroke unit, also found in later Saab cars until the late sixties. In 1958 production began of the original Trabant, the P50. This car was the base of the Trabant series, and even the latest 1.1s had a large number of interchangeable parts with this car. The 500 cc 18hp (13kW) P50 evolved into a 20hp (15kW) version in 1960, gaining a fully synchronized gearbox amongst other things, and finally got a 23hp 600 cc engine in 1962, becoming the P60. The updated P601 was introduced in 1964. This car was essentially a facelift of the P60, with a different front fascia, bonnet, roof and rear, whilst retaining the original P50 underpinnings. This model stayed practically unchanged up to its production end, with the most major changes being 12v electrics, coil springs for the rear and a different dash for the latest models. The Trabant's designers expected production to extend to 1967 at the latest, and East German designers and engineers created a series of more sophisticated prototypes through the years that were intended to replace the Trabant P601; several of these can be seen at the Dresden Transport Museum. However, each proposal for a new model was rejected by the GDR leadership for reasons of cost. As a result, the Trabant remained in production largely unchanged; in contrast, the Czechoslovak koda automobiles were continually updated and exported successfully. The Trabant's production method, which was extremely labour-intensive, remained unchanged. Starting in the summer of 1989, thousands of East Germans loaded their Trabants with as much as they could carry and drove to either Hungary or Czechoslovakia en route to West Germanythe so-called "Trabi Trail." Many of them had to get special dispensation to drive their Trabants into West Germany, since most of the Trabants on the road failed West German emissions standards (their pollution was four times the European average).[13] In 1989 a licensed version of the Volkswagen Polo engine replaced the elderly two-stroke engine, the result of a trade agreement between the two German states. The model, known as the Trabant 1.1 also had minor improvements to the brake and signal lights, a revised grille and replaced the leaf spring-suspended chassis with one using MacPherson struts. However, by the time it entered production in May 1990, the two states had already agreed to reunification. It soon became apparent that there was no place for the Trabant in the reunified German economy. The inefficient, labour-intensive production line was kept open only because of government subsidies. Demand plummeted, as residents of the east preferred second-hand western cars which were more efficient and put out less pollution. The production line closed in 1991 and the factory in Mosel (Zwickau), where the Trabant 1.1 had been made, was sold to Volkswagen. The rest of the company became HQM Sachsenring GmbH. Although Trabants had been exported from East Germany, they became well known in the West after the fall of the Berlin Wall when many were abandoned by their Eastern owners after migrating westward. Unlike many other Eastern European cars of the communist era (notably the Lada Riva, Skoda Estelle, Polski Fiat and Yugo), however, it was not a strong seller in Western Europe. News reports inaccurately described them as having cardboard bodies. This is likely due to the fact that the body of the Trabant was Duroplast, a material that, in East German production, often made use of varying quantities of different fibres, such as cotton, or occasionally paper. In the early 1990s it was possible to buy a Trabant for as little as a few marks, and many were given away. Later, as they became collectors' items, prices recovered, but they remain very cheap cars. Green Trabants are especially popular as they are said to bring good luck. The popular culture surrounding the Trabant was referenced by the performance artist Liz Cohen in her Bodywork project, which transformed an East German 1987 Trabant into a 1973 Chevrolet El Camino.[14] In the late 1990s, there were plans to put the Trabant back into production in Uzbekistan as the Olimp.[15] However, only a single model was produced.[16] Former Bulgarian Foreign Minister and Atlantic Club of Bulgaria founding president Solomon Passy owned a famous Trabant, which he used to take NATO Secretaries General Manfred Wrner, George Robertson and Jaap de Hoop Scheffer for a ride. Passy's Trabant was also blessed by Pope John Paul II in 2002. In 2005, Passy donated the vehicle, which had become a symbol of Bulgaria's NATO accession, to the National Historical Museum of Bulgaria.[17] In 1997, the Trabant was celebrated for passing the "Elchtest" ("moose test"), a 60km/h (37mph) swerve manoeuvre slalom, without toppling over like the Mercedes-Benz A-Class infamously did. A newspaper from Thuringia had a headline saying "Come and get us, moose! Trabi passes A-Class killer test".[18] In 2007 Herpa, a miniature vehicles manufacturer in Bavaria, showed a scale model of the "New Trabi" and revealed that they planned to introduce it. They bought the rights to the name and plan to produce a series of 5,000 cars. It would likely have a BMW engine and be sold for around 50,000.[19][20] In 2007 the Trabant (A P50 painted British Racing Green) was brought into the world of diplomacy. Steven Fisher, the Deputy Head of Mission in the British Embassy of Budapest uses it as his diplomatic car.[21] In August 2009 it was announced that a new Trabant powered by an electric engine will be unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show on 17 September with production starting if investment can be secured.[22][23] Trabant P50 Prototype Trabant P50 Limousine later called Trabant 500 Limousine Trabant P50 Universal later called Trabant 500 Universal Trabant 600 Limousine Trabant 600 Universal Trabant 601 Standard Limousine Trabant 601 S Universal (with sliding roof) Trabant 601 DeLuxe Limousine Trabant 601 Kbel Trabant 800 RS Trabant1.1 Limousine Trabant 1.1 Universal The particularly archaic look and unique two-stroke engine sound of the Trabant has made it become a beloved model amongst the car tuning community in Central Europe. Many variations exist although two major streams have been developed. The first stream meticulously preserves the two-stroke engine sound, while either tuning the original two cylinder engine for higher performance or using a two-stroke propulsion unit designed for another car (e.g. the 1000 cc Wartburg). Since the car is very lightweight (approx. 750kg (1,653lb)), a small increase in engine power can rapidly increase its power-to-weight ratio, giving it a remarkable boost. The second stream goes beyond the sentimental sound and encompasses a range of modifications from a complete engine swap to a thorough upgrade on the traction of Trabant, leaving only the body to hide a modern powerful car underneath (e.g. the Sascha Fiss' Volkswagen Lupo GTI). Some say that the perplexing effect caused by a postmodern Trabi that can overtake modern cars as described above 150km/h (93mph) is worth all the effort. Also common is the combination of a Trabant with a Japanese superbike engine, such as the engine of a Suzuki Hayabusa (a combination known as Trabusa). Some cars with supercharged powerplants have a rated power of over 150hp (112kW). Due to the light weight, this gives a power-to-weight ratio of 11lb/hp (149 W/kg) allowing these vehicles to achieve performance comparable to modern mid-range sports cars. It has become an established tradition for Trabant fan clubs in central Europe to organise annual meetings to present new tuning modifications and performance accessories for the vehicle. Even though Trabant doesn't have much of a history of being green, two German companies are trying to find investors to create the Trabant nT, an electric car that will be equipped with a 45kW asynchronous motor powered with a lithium-ion battery.[24] The nT will have a 100-mile (160-km) range on a full charge, a top speed of 80mph (128km/h), and a cost of US$29,000 or about 19,600.
