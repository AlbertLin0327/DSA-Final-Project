Equastone is a real estate investment advisor company, headquartered in San Diego, California. Equastone owns the following skyscrapers[1]: It also owns several other high-rise and smaller office buildings in Texas, Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, California, and Oregon. As of April 2009[update], the Equitable Building is in foreclosure[2][3], a month after its River Place Corporate Park office complex in Austin, Texas did the same[4].
