There are about 80 Indian families in Mexico, constituting a total number of about 400 NRIs. Most of them are recent arrivals in the country. Almost all of them have settled down in the capital city. Mexico has a non-discriminatory policy with regard to the grant of its citizenship. The spouse of a Mexican national would generally not face any problem in acquiring local citizenship. But although quite a few NRIs have married Mexicans, they have retained their Indian citizenship. The Indians in this country are mainly businessmen or professionals. Many of them work with one or other international organisation or a multinational corporation. There are also some academicians and scientists among them. They have helped to bring about greater mutual understanding between India and their host country. At present, Dr Raja Ram (a distinguished Indian scientist and Padma Shri recipient) is also in Mexico, working at CIMMYT. Some of the Indians work for ISPAT Mexicana. This company is part of the Laxmi Mittal group, well known in this region for having turned around a sinking steel company in Trinidad. The Indian presence in Mexico has been greatly appreciated as fifty other business ventures have invested around US$1.58 billion in this country during the period 1994-2000. Most members of the diaspora speak Spanish and have adapted themselves admirably to their foreign environment. The Indian community in Mexico has no divisive factions in it, although its constituents come from different parts of India. It has jointly established an organisation called Sangam, under whose auspices it celebrates important festivals and cultural programmes.   A Sai Baba temple and a Vaishnav temple have been constructed in Mexico City by the Sangam Organisation. ISKCON has extensive presence in Mexico. It has the following 8 Centres in Mexico Centre 1- Guadalajara, Pedro Moreno No. 1791, Sector Juarez, Jalisco Centre 2- Mexico City, Tiburcio Montiel 45, Colonia San Miguel, Chapultepec D.F, 11850 Centre 3- Monterrey, Av.
