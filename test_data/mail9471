Ghulam Hussainy Umdat-Ul-Umra, Nawab Umra (died 1801) was the Nawab of the Carnatic region of India from 1795 to 1801. Many members of the British East India Company believed that Umdat Ul-Umra the Nawab of Carnatic secretly provided assistance to Tipu Sultan during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and immediately sought his deposition after the year 1799. He was actually named by his grandfather Anwaruddin Khan as "Abdul Wali". But he was subsequently renamed as "Umdat-Ul-Umra" after the name of the court of the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II. Umdat-Ul-Umra was the son of Muhammad Ali Khan Walahjah a stern ally of the British East India Company. Umdat-Ul-Umra ruled from 1795 to 1801. During his reign, the British East India Company demanded pieces of land as gift. On the fall of Tippu Sultan in 1799, the British accused the Nawab of collaborating with Tipu Sultan and demanded the entire administration of the kingdom as indemnity. Umdat-Ul-Umra vehemently protested against the offensive authority of the British East India Company. Umdat-Ul-Umra, however, died soon afterwards and the takeover was effected during the reign of his successor.
