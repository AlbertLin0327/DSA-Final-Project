Flood is the third album by Japanese band Boris. Like the previous albums, it stays lengthy and massively slow, but in addition to sludge influences such as the Melvins and Sleep, there are undertones of psychedelic rock. The back cover lists only one track, but the CD actually has the song broken into four tracks. "Flood I" consists basically of a guitar riff which is repeated and modulated throughout the song; echoing drums and noises are inserted near the end. The noises culminate on the beginning of "Flood II". "Flood II" is a minimalist, psychedelic rock song. Slow drums, calm chord progressions and a guitar solo fill this track. "Flood III" starts with a calm guitar riff from the previous section; the same riff is repeated on a heavily distorted guitar that looms in from the background. The song evolves into an epic doom piece, with vocals performed by Atsuo and Takeshi in unison. The song reaches its climax, and a riff is repeated on the bass while noises and echoes from the distorted guitar fill the background. "Flood IV" consists primarily of this, with the noises strengthened, and a clean guitar that plays some notes for a while. Only one song is listed, but it is split into 4 parts on the disc.
