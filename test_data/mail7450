Lucilla Matthew Andrews Crichton (20 November 1919  3 October 2006) was a British romantic novelist who wrote as Lucilla Andrews. She joined the British Red Cross in 1940 and later trained as a nurse at St Thomas' Hospital, London, during World War II. She was a founder member of the Romantic Novelists' Association, which honoured her shortly before her death with a lifetime achievement award.[1] As a writer of thirty-five novels over the period 195496[2] she specialised in hospital romances. Her noms de plume included Diana Gordon and Joanna Marcus. In late 2006, Lucilla Andrews' autobiography No Time for Romance became the focus of a posthumous controversy. It has been alleged that the novelist Ian McEwan plagiarised from this work while writing his novel, Atonement. McEwan has protested his innocence.[3][4][5]
