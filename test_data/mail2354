John Terence Reese (28 August 1913  29 January 1996) was a British bridge player and writer, regarded as one of the finest of all time in both fields. He was born in Epsom, Surrey, England to middle-class parents, and was educated at Bradfield College and New College, Oxford, where he studied classics and attained a double first, graduating in 1935. His father, the son of a Welsh clergyman, worked in a bank until he transferred to his wife's family catering business. Reese said "I played card games before I could read".[1] As a small boy, when his mother "issued the standard warning about not talking to strange men, my father remarked that it was the strange men who should be warned against trying to talk to me".[1] His mother Anne ran a hotel near Guildford, and with it a bridge club, so Reese played in the earliest duplicate matches, around 1930. Whilst at Oxford he met some serious bridge players, amongst whom were Lt.-Col. Walter Buller, Iain Macleod and Maurice Harrison-Gray, the strongest player in the country at that time. Within a year of graduating and after a brief stint at Harrod's, Reese started working for Hubert Phillips' magazine and co-authored his first book with him in 1937.[2] Phillips acknowledges that although the book is published jointly under their names, "Terence is the real author of the book",[3] receiving only assistance in planning contents and editing from Phillips. From that point on, Reese's profession was that of a champion contract bridge player and prolific writer on the game. Reese joined the ARP a few months before the war, and was never inducted into the armed forces. He ended up working in the factory of Pedro Juan (a fellow bridge player), which manufactured black-out curtains. When a Ministry of Labour inspector turned up to check on him, a hasty phone-call was needed to get Terence into an office surrounded by ledgers.[4] Reese had some hobbies; even those he pursued with typical commitment. He was always a cricket and chess enthusiast. After World War II he made a book on greyhound racing; later he became an avid football fan, reputedly supporting Queen's Park Rangers, whose ground was next door to the White City Stadium, a home of greyhound racing. He played various other games for money, especially canasta, poker and backgammon, and wrote books on them. Reese edited the British Bridge World from 1956 to 1962. He married Alwyn Sherrington in 1970. They resided in London and later in Hove, Sussex where he died of aspirin poisoning at home on 29 January 1996 at the age of 83; an inquest ruled his death accidental.[5] As a bridge player, Reese won every honour in the game, including the European Championship four times (1948, 1949, 1954, 1963) and the Bermuda Bowl (effectively, the World Team Championship) in 1955. He was also World Par champion in 1961 and was placed second in the World Teams Olympiad in 1960, and the World Open Pairs in 1962. He also represented Britain in the Olympiad 1960 and the Bermuda Bowl 1965, and in five other European Championships. He won the Gold Cup, the premier British domestic competition, on eight occasions.[6] Reese last participated in international bridge in the 5th World Team Olympiad in Monte Carlo in 1976[7] placing third and was Britain's non-playing captain in the 35th European Team Championships held in Birmingham, England in 1981[8] placing second. Preferring backgammon as an alternative in his later years, Reese played little competitive bridge, owing in part to increasing deafness.[5][9] However, his career as a bridge writer continued unabated. The concept for "the Little Major was born"[10] in late 1962, while Reese was enroute to a tournament in the Canary Islands with Boris Schapiro. First with Schapiro and then Jeremy Flint, Reese initially created the Little Major bidding system as a warning of what would happen if the development of artificial bidding systems was allowed to go unchecked. However, under this camouflage, the system was a genuine attempt with interesting features. Ultimately, the system was abandoned when its two-year EBU 'A' license was withdrawn "on the grounds that not enough players were playing the system".[10] Reese's long-time partner, Boris Schapiro, put his opinion in a bridge magazine article: Eleven years later, Schapiro still thought Reese was the best player in the country: Upon Reese's death, Schapiro wrote: Victor Mollo had this to say about Reese in 1967: Alan Truscott in a New York Times article 12 February 1996, two weeks after Reese's death: Reese's 1965 appearance in the Buenos Aires Bermuda Bowl was marred by an accusation that he and his partner Boris Schapiro were communicating illegally (i.e. cheating). At a hearing held at the tournament site in Buenos Aires, the World Bridge Federation (WBF) judged Reese and Schapiro guilty of transmitting finger signals to each other indicating how many hearts each held. The WBF banned them from the remainder of the Bermuda Bowl and ordered the forfeit of all matches in which they had participated up to that point; further punishment was left uncertain at that time. An important factor in the Buenos Aires procedure was that the pair had not been given an adequate opportunity to defend themselves. The British team captain had agreed with the accusation before discussing the matter with the players. The British Bridge League subsequently convened their own enquiry into the matter in a manner which did allow the players to defend themselves. After many months, and taking testimony from a number of eyewitnesses, bridge analysts, and character witnesses, the "Foster Enquiry", as it was called, concluded that Reese and Schapiro had not been proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and therefore acquitted them. Several factors must have played a part in this decision, especially the fact that little or no connection could be made between the claimed signals and the results at the table. Reese and Schapiro had not played especially well in Buenos Aires; Reese commented later that no pair were likely to cheat in a way that did not help them win. A simple system to signal whether a player was good or poor for his bid would be almost certain to bring good dividends.[15] In his 1966 book, Story of an Accusation, Reese went through every single hand presented by the 'prosecution' and showing that the bidding was clear by the principles of the Acol system they were using, and several occasions when they might have used information about the heart suit had it been available. Truscott also wrote his account, The Great Bridge Scandal,[16] concentrating on the observations and reaching the opposite conclusion. Neither side changed their opinions, and a considerable rift developed in the bridge world. The official World Bridge Federation position maintains the 1965 finding of guilty but after representations from the British Bridge League and others, the WBF announced in 1968 "that the suspension was over, Reese and Schapiro would be allowed to play, but not together"[17] in the world championships. There were other cases of accusations at the highest level, in one of which members of the famous Italian Blue Team were accused, again by members of the American team. The solution to this unsatisfactory situation came at last with introduction of bidding boxes and the system of movable compartments ('screens') which prevent players from seeing their own partners during bidding (a system only used at tournaments of the highest rank). One other member of the British team, Reese's then main partner Jeremy Flint, gave a lengthy account of the accusation.[18] Flint starts by mentioning some facts that were known at the time, but may be forgotten now. The results of the BBL trials was: 1 ReeseFlint; 2 KonstamSchapiro; 3 Albert RoseRalph Swimer. The BBL then announced the team, omitting Swimer and substituting Maurice Harrison-Gray. Swimer had to be content with being non-playing captain. In addition, Reese and Schapiro were hardly on speaking terms at the time; Reese's decision to form a partnership with Flint had been decided in 1962, and the pair co-operated to develop the Little Major bidding system. Flint makes two main points (over and above points made by Reese) as follows: 1. The bitter quarrel between Reese and Schapiro "was surely not the perfect background for alleged dishonest complicity". 2. When Flint was playing with Reese in the closed room, Geoffrey Butler (BBL official) and Waldemar von Zedwitz (senior American master) came to watch. After the session Flint said to Reese: "Reese is considered a fool by no-one [yet] according to his accusers he continued to exchange signals for the next seven days".[19] In May 2005, a claim was made by a bridge player and publisher to the effect that Reese had made a confession to him forty years previously.[20] This claim was made public after the deaths of both Reese and Schapiro. There is no corroboration to support this account. In contrast, Shapiro's widow, Helen had stated that "at no point did Boris admit to cheating in Buenos Aires. To the contrary, he said there was never any impropriety." [21] Reese also had a second career as a bridge author and journalist, a career that lasted throughout his life. He was one of the most influential and acerbic of bridge writers, with a large output (over ninety titles[5]), including several books which remain in print as classics of bridge play. He was also the long-time bridge correspondent of The Lady, The Observer, the London Evening News and the Evening Standard. Reese contributed to the Acol bidding system originally developed by Maurice Harrison-Gray, Jack Marx and S.J.("Skid") Simon in the late 1920s and early 1930s[22] and co-authored the first textbook on it with Ben Cohen in 1938.[23] Named after the Acol Bridge Club in North London (located on Acol Road at the time[24]), it became the prevailing bidding system in Britain and some other parts of the world. The book and its subsequent editions in 1939, 1946 and 1949 gave unity to what was otherwise a rather free-wheeling bidding system. His later adaptation of Garozzo and Yallouze's book on the Blue Club and his book on the Precision Club were widely used by devotees of strong club systems, and by their opponents as references. The great success of Reese on Play (an outstanding text on dummy play and defence) was followed by an even more ambitious work. The Expert Game was the book which really made his name. As the title suggests, it dealt with card play at the highest level, including some ideas that were novel at the time, for instance, inferences from events that did not occur, and the principle of restricted choice. Examples of bridge logic abound in Reese, for instance, a player who overcalls but does not lead his suit is likely to lack one or two key honours; this concept is often called 'the dog that did not bark in the night' (after Sherlock Holmes in Arthur Conan Doyle's Silver Blaze). Another form of logic can be seen in 'If it must be so, assume it is so'. His examples of counting (and other ways of drawing inferences from the bidding and play) spread such ideas from a coterie of masters in London (or New York) to a much wider group of nascent experts. For at least twenty years after this book was published, one could be sure that virtually every top-class player had studied it minutely. Reese also had the distinction of creating several new genres of bridge book. The most significant was the 'Over my shoulder' genre, where the reader is taken through the master's thinking as the bidding and play proceeds through the hand. Play Bridge with Reese was the model for several such works. Develop Your Bidding Judgement was another such work. Later, Reese made use of the growing library of hands from international competitions to create interesting quiz-type books, where the discussion was usually on the verso of the page which presented the problem. Famous Hands from Famous Matches was the first of these, followed by Famous Bidding Decisions and Famous Play Decisions, all written with David Bird. In his career as a writer, Reese had a number of co-authors, mostly highly competent players and writers, yet all his books were in his inimitable style. Another of his ideas was to raid the stock of hands in bridge magazine bidding competitions for interesting and instructive hands. What Would You Bid? was the result. Reese also wrote books on poker, casino gambling, canasta and backgammon.
