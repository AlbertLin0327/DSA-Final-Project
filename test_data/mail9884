80 guns: HMS Torbay was an 80-gun third rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched at Deptford Dockyard on 16 December 1693.[1] In 1707, she served as flagship of Rear-Admiral of the Blue Sir John Norris and belonged to Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell's fleet. She saw action during the unsuccessful Battle of Toulon and was present during the great naval disaster off the Isles of Scilly when Shovell and four of his ships (Association, Firebrand, Romney and Eagle) were lost, claiming the lives of nearly 2,000[3] sailors. Torbay suffered little to no damage and finally managed to reach Portsmouth. She was rebuilt at Deptford, according to the 1706 Establishment, and was relaunched on 23 May 1719. After this, her 80 guns were mounted on three gundecks instead of her original two, though she continued to be classified as a third rate.[2] Torbay was broken up in 1749.[2]
