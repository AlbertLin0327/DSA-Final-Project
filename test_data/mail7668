Dietrich Tiedemann (1748-1803) was a German philosopher who was a native of Bremervrde. He was father to physiologist Friedrich Tiedemann (1781-1861). He was a student at the University of Gttingen, and later a professor at Collegium Carolinum in Kassel (from 1776) and at the University of Marburg (from 1786). Tiedemann was author of the six-volume Geist der spekulativen Philosophie von Thales bis Berkeley (The Spirit of Speculative Philosophy from Thales to Berkeley). Tiedemann had strong disagreements regarding the philosophic beliefs of Immanuel Kant (1724-1804), of which he critiques in two publications; "On the Nature of Metaphysics: An Examination of Professor Kant's Principles-Against the Aesthetic" and "Continuation of the Examination of Professor Kant's Thoughts About the Nature of Metaphysics-Against the Analytic". Kant dismissed Tiedemann's arguments, which he reasoned were caused by a lack of understanding. Tiedemann was a pioneer of empirical psychology, and an early practitioner in regards to scientific study of child development. He kept a journal of his son's sensory, motor, language, and cognitive behavior during the first thirty months of his life. Through his empirical observations he claimed that children possessed a "pre-linguistic knowledge".
