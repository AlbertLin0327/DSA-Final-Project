Carrickfergus FM[1] is a Restricted Service Licence community radio station which broadcasts bi-annually in the town of Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland during the Christmas[2] and Summer periods.[3] The station was launched in June 2005, and was set up by a committee of local traders and two commercial radio presenters who had many years experience in running and operating RSL's. The community station is primarily for the residents of the Borough of Carrickfergus but also broadcasts online and combines a mix of professional radio presenters with new talent from the local area. It currently is the longest running short-term radio station in Northern Ireland. Carrickfergus FM's reputation within the borough is such that it has attracted several celebrity interviews, recently including the likes of former Eurovision winner Niamh Kavanagh [1], ex-Premier League footballer Michael Hughes [2], X Factor's Eoghan Quigg [3] and highly acclaimed broadcasters George Jones Hendi & John Rosborough amongst others.
