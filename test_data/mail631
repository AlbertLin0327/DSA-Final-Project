Clive Sarstedt (born Clive Robin Sarstedt, 21 January 1944, Ajmer, Rajastan, Northern India[1]) is a British pop music singer. He made his recording debut as Wes Sands[2] (recorded by Joe Meek, who also was his manager), and later continued as Clive Sands[3]. He joined The Deejays in Sweden in 1966/1967. They had two big hits on "Tio i Topp" in Sweden: "Dum Dum (Marble Breaks And Iron Bends)" and "Baby Talk". He finally had a hit in 1976, with a cover version of the Hoagy Carmichael penned song, "My Resistance Is Low", billed as Robin Sarstedt.[4] It reached Number 3 in the UK Singles Chart.[5] Without tangible other chart success, he remains a British one-hit wonder. In the Benelux countries however he hit the charts later in 1976 with his cover version of "Let's Fall In Love", a song written by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler and published in 1933. He is the youngest brother of Peter and Eden Kane/Richard Sarstedt. Musical activity from 1996 onwards can be found here - http://www.guitardaddy.co.uk/clivesarstedt.htm As of 2008[update], he is living in Los Pinos, near Bdar, a village in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain. Certainly in 2009 he was a regular on Mojacar Playa during the summer season, most people unaware of who they were watching.
