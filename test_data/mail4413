Antalya Anadolu Lisesi, also known as Antalya Anatolian High School was founded in 1980. It is considered one of the best Anatolian High Schools in Turkey.[citation needed] The education in this school is mostly in English and students are required to pass an entrance examination before being admitted to the school.
