Lilicub is a French band founded in 1992, mainly known for its 1996 hit "Voyage en Italie". The group was originally a trio composed of Catherine Dirand, Benot Carr (actress Isabelle Carr's brother) and Philippe Zavriew. Benot met Catherine at a jazz festival in Ampthill. In late 1993, they signed with the label Remark and released their first single entitled Au bout du compte early 1995.[1] Their second single "Voyage in Italie" ensured their reputation placing at #7 on the French SNEP Top 50 during the 1996 summer.[2] Lilicub was nominated at the 1997 Victoires de la Musique in the category "Revelation of the year",[3] and awarded the price Sacem Roger Seiller for "Best French group" in 1998.[1] The same year, Lilicub released its second album, La Grande Vacance. The group then engaged in collaborations with Japanese artists like Taeko Onuki et Noriko Kato. The third album entitled Zoom was produced as a film and was released in 2001. In 2005, the band began a tour across France to promote its new songs.
