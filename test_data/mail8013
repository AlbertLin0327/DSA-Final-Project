HelmsBriscoe is a meeting procurement and site selection agency headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona. Founded in 1992 by Roger Helms, HelmsBriscoe has a network of Associates in over 50 countries [1] averaging 15 years of hotel, meeting planning and industry experience to deliver meetings worldwide.[2] HelmsBriscoe books over 25,000 meetings annually making it the worlds largest booker of group rooms. In 2010 the company booked over $675 million in room revenue equating to over $1 billion in hotel spend. Because HelmsBriscoe works on behalf of their clients and not as a hotel representative, hotels all over the world are researched to find the best location and price based on the criteria their clients provide. The process consists of an associate discussing the clients program needs and creates a request for proposals (RFP) to evaluate potential venues. The company will track down the answers, follow up with the hotels and manage the process on the clients behalf, all at no charge to the client. HelmsBriscoe was founded in 1992 [3] by Roger Helms in Scottsdale, AZ with a very simple premise, by representing their clients they can create the best match between the needs of the meeting planner and the right hotel. HelmsBriscoe maintains a vast array of partnerships with virtually every major hotel chain and most independent properties both domestically and internationally.[4] HelmsBriscoe Associates participate in a variety of industry organizations at the national and local levels. A few examples of these organizations include: HelmsBriscoe has committed to a five-year plan in support of the Meeting Professionals International (MPI) Foundation's 25 Years of Giving campaign. The program will create 25 annual scholarships for meeting planners to attend the World Education Conference. HelmsBriscoe's financial support will also be applied toward scholarships for CMP and CMM certifications as well as MPI membership scholarships.[5]
