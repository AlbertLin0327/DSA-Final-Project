Ahmad Agha Fadhelaldin Agha Al-Asali Duzdar was mayor of Jerusalem from 1838 to as late as 1863. His official title was 'Ottoman Governor of Jerusalem'. He was known for his dealings with Moses Montefiore and his name appears in a petition by Muhammad Sharif in 1840 demanding that "the Jews must not be enabled to carry out the paving, and they must be cautioned against raising their voices and displaying their books at the Western wall."[1] In 2005 the Turkish government in consultations with the Wakf built a marker for his grave which is in the southern end of the Mamilla Cemetery in west Jerusalem. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
