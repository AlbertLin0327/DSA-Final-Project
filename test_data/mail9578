Coordinates: 292859S 1214959E / 29.483S 121.833E / -29.483; 121.833 Yerilla is an abandoned town located in the Goldfields-Esperance region in Western Australia. It is found between Kalgoorlie and Laverton. Gold was discovered in the area in January 1895 when the Mount Catherine reef was discovered. The reef is loctaed about 6km south of the town and was particularly rich in alluvial gold. Another outcrop, the Queen of the Earth was discovered by the prospectors MacGregor, McAuliffe and party further from town. This sparked a gold rush to the field and by 1896 the local miners had joinded together and formed a progress association and requested that a townsite be declared. The town was gazetted in November 1896.[1] A police station situated in McKinery Street commenced operations in July 1897 with Constable L. McDonald initially manning the station. A Post Office and four hotels were open in town in 1898 the Commercial Hotel, the Smith Hotel (later named the Never Never Hotel), the Royal Hotel and the Yerilla Hotel.[2] A coach service from Coolgardie via Menzies and Yerilla to Pennyweight Point operated weekly in 1898. A battery was erected in the area by working leasholders some time after 1895 but was poorly patronised so by 1900 it was dismantled and taken to Niagara.[3] Kalgoorlie Boulder Coolgardie Esperance Hopetoun Kambalda Kambalda West Laverton Leonora Norseman Ravensthorpe Agnew Balagundi Balgarri Bardoc Beria Black Flag Bonnie Vale Boorara Broad Arrow Buldania Bullabulling Bulong Burbanks Burtville Callion Cascade Comet Vale Condingup Coonana Cosmo Newbery Cundeelee Dalyup Davyhurst Duketon Dundas Dunnsville Eucla Eulaminna Euro Feysville Forrest Gibson Gindalbie Golden Ridge Goongarrie Grass Patch Gudarra Gwalia Higginsville Israelite Bay Jerdacuttup Kanowna Kathleen Kintore Kookynie Kurnalpi Kunanalling Kundana Kurrajong Kurrawang Lakewood Lawlers Leinster Linden Londonderry Loongana Malcolm Menzies Mertondale Mount Burges Mount Ida Mount Margaret Mount Morgans Mulgarrie Mulwarrie Mulline Mungari Munglinup Murrin Murrin Niagara Ora Banda Princess Royal Rawlinna Salmon Gums Scaddan Sir Samuel Tampa Vivien Warburton Waverley Widgiemooltha Windanya Wingellina Woodarra Yarri Yerilla Yunndaga Yundamindera Zanthus
