It was founded in 1848 by a group of music enthusiasts and moved to its present address in Westland Row in 1871. The following year it was granted the right to use the title "Royal". In addition to academic degrees, the RIAM offers a variety of courses and examinations in the fields of music, public speaking and drama, including associate and licentiate diplomas. Grade examinations and practical and teaching diplomas can be taken by internal and external students.
