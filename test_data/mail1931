Ornavasso (Ossolano: Urnavass, Walser German: Urnafasch) is a comune (municipality) in the Province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola in the Italian region Piedmont, located about 110km northeast of Turin and about 11km northwest of Verbania. Ornavasso borders the following municipalities: Anzola d'Ossola, Gravellona Toce, Mergozzo, Premosello Chiovenda. In the area there are two necropolises of the Lepontii-Celtic culture, dating to 2nd century BC-1st century AD. From the 14th century to the late 19th century, Ornavasso and its frazione of Migiandone were a language island of Walser German, due to the presence of immigrates from the Simplon area. Traces of the German culture persist in the local dialect and the Carnival tradition. During World War II, Ornavasso was the base of the Valtoce Partisan Division.
