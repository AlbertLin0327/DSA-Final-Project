Waddow Hall is a 17th-century Grade II listed building within a 178-acre (72ha) estate that serves as a conference and activity centre for Girlguiding UK near Clitheroe, Lancashire.[1][2] Waddow Hall has been managed by Girlguiding UK since 1927.[1] The Waddow estate and the Parish of Waddington were managed by Roger de Tempest of Bracewell, Lord of Waddington in 1267. Waddow Hall was built by the Tempest family during the Tudor period,[3] and the estate and lands remained in the Tempest family until 1657, when Richard Tempest died in a debtor's prison.[4] Following Richard Tempest's death in prison, the land and buildings of the Waddow estate were acquired by Christopher Wilkinson, an out-bailiff and Member of Parliament from Clitheroe. Wilkinson bequeathed the estate and building to Weddell of Widdington in 1673, and the property and buildings remained in the Weddell family until 1778, when Thomas Weddell bequeathed them to Sir John Ramsden.[4] Waddow remained in the Ramsden family until the mid 1800s, when it was sold to William Garnett by Sir John Ramsden, 5th Baronet. The Girl Guides Association rented the Estate between 1927 and 1928, using it as an activity centre, and purchased it for 9,000 from William Garnet's son on 16October 1928.[4] During the Second World War the estate was lent to Lancashire County Council, and served as an isolation hospital for children.[4][5] According to local folklore the estate is haunted by the ghost of Peg O' Nell, a former servant at Waddow Hall, murdered by her mistress. The legend suggests that Peg O' Nell was sent to fetch water from a well, when her mistress cast a spell on her causing her to slip and die while fetching the water.[6][7] In November 2004 the British paranormal reality television show Most Haunted broadcast an episode from Waddow Hall.[8]
