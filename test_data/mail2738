Jody Williams better known as Jody (born 17 May 1990) is a South African Pop/R&B singer. She won the fourth season of the Idols (South Africa) competition on 9 December 2007 at age 17, making her the youngest winner of the competition so far. Jody won prior to Sasha- Lee Davids and Jason Hartman who shared the title. Her debut platinum-selling album, "Just Gonna Be Me" reached #1 on the South African Albums Chart[1] along with three consecutive number one singles on the South African Airplay Chart; "Love Is All Around", "Kiss Of Life" and "Wind It". Another hit is Love Like This Before. Elements of Pop, R&B, dance and soul can be found in her music. Jody has cited singers Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey and Celine Dion has her main musical inspirations and influences. Jody is one of three siblings who grew up in a home in Cape Town, South Africa. Jody has an older sister Candice, with a five year age difference. As a child Jody was shy and had few friends, she resorted to listening to music, namely her "Idol" - Celine Dion to replace the emptyness obtained from her quiet social life. Jody first picked up a hairbrush and started singing at age 9.[2] At age 13, Jody started receiving vocal training. Her parents, namely her father (stated as her biggest inspiration[2]) recognized her vocal talent and when auditions arrived for the fourth season of "Idols (South Africa)" arrived in Cape Town, she and her father were anything but hesitant at the opportunity. She later won the competition, received a record deal with Sony BMG, a Citroen C1, a Cardies hamper, cellphone and spa treatments for a year and Yamaha music and sound equipment among other prizes. From Idols, Jody grew to become much more mature and more confident with herself, performing and vocal abilities.[3] Jody managed to prioritize the duties Idols and her debut album required of her whilst still at high school. Jody, the dedicated student she was, was willing to take an extra year in completing her matric. She is currently studying at a high school in the seaside town of Milnerton in Cape Town, where she is set to graduate at the end of 2009. Jody has also been greatly admired by her idol, Celine Dion. Celine mentioned to Jody: "Good luck for the future. I wish you all the best. You'll get there". At the time Jody received the privilege of being the opening act for Celine Dion in part of the first 9 shows in the South African and first overall leg of the "Taking Chances Tour" tour, which begun 14 February 2008.[4] On 9 December 2007, Jody beat out 21 year-old fellow Cape Townian, Andritte Norman in the fourth season of Idols (South Africa), which saw a record-breaking 7,803,990 votes being cast. It was also the first season where votes could be cast through the social-networking communication device "MXit" - 80% of the users being teenagers. Hence, the record-breaking votes. Jody was said to have the majority of support in both the adult and teenager fanbases, which in the end gave her the advantage in winning the competition over the other contestants. Jody described her song choices during the competition: I chose songs I Jody because it would makes my performances easier. I didn't want to try and learn a whole new song and then forget my words.[2] With most of the South African Idols fading after winning the competition, Jody reassured her fans: I'm not gonna fade I'll always be there making new music for you guys.[5] During the six month-long competition, Jody quickly rose to fame from successfully performing power ballads from the music industry's finest vocalists namely Whitney Houston, Celine Dion and Christina Aguilera. Her performances of Whitney Houston's "Run To You" and "I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)" were raved as her best performances of the whole competition, hence why she chose to repeat them on the final stage of the competition. Jody also showcased her ability as a versatile singer, pulling off "brilliant" performances of songs originally done by male artists, namely Bryan Adams, Michael Jackson, Puff Johnson, Luther Vandross and Jeffrey Osborne. Jody also did renditions of modern-esque and at the time popular songs, namely the pop rock song "Behind These Hazel Eyes" by American Idol first season winner Kelly Clarkson and Swedish Idol winner, Agnes Carlsson's "Love Is All Around" - which later became the winner's song and Jody's first single. Jody's performances on songs originally done by girl groups proved her voice is as overwhelming and strong enough to take on songs originally done by three or more girls together. Namely "I Don't Need A Man" by The Pussycat Dolls and "Secrets" by South African urban-pop girl group, Jamali. Jody performed a few songs in the 2009 South African Idols Finale including Wind It. In a recent magazine article, she said that she is strongly supporting Sasha- Lee Davids and Daniel Baron who unfortunately fell out in the top nine result show. *Idols performances: After Jody's victory on Idols, Independent Democrats leader, Patricia de Lille had this to say: Idols winner Jody Williams deserves special congratulations on her achievement of becoming South Africa's youngest idol. We know that she will continue to inspire the youth of today. To her parents we can only say, well done for raising such a beautiful, talented child. South Africa certainly needs more young role models like her. The ID will give her all the support she needs.[6] Williams represented the continent of Africa to sing the Official Theme Song of the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games, Everyone. She collaborated with four other artists, American Sean Kingston (Americas), Singaporean Tabitha Nauser (Asia), British Steve Appleton (Europe), and Australian Jessica Mauboy (Oceania).
