Newfound Lake is located in Grafton County, New Hampshire, USA, within the towns of Bridgewater, Bristol, Alexandria, and Hebron. The lake is located in a section of New Hampshire known as the Lakes Region. At 4,451 acres[1], it is the third-largest lake located entirely in New Hampshire. The lake's water is refreshed twice-over annually by underground springs. The lake is about 2 miles wide and 6 miles (9.7km) long and has a maximum depth of 183 feet (56m). Major tributaries include the Fowler River and the Cockermouth River. Its outlet is the Newfound River, flowing into the Pemigewasset River. Wellington State Park, containing a large public beach, is located on the lake's west shore in the town of Bristol.
