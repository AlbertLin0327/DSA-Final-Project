Sainte-Ccile-d'Andorge Coordinates: 441510N 35837E / 44.2528N 3.9769E / 44.2528; 3.9769 Sainte-Ccile-d'Andorge is a commune in the Gard department in southern France. The commune or Sainte Ccile d'Andorge is sparsely populated. It lies at the extreme north of the department of Gard, forming part of the border with Lozre. Its river, the Andorge here joins the larger Gardon d'Als (sometimes known as the Long Valley) whose sources lie further up the valley in Lozre. The waters flow through this long cevenol valley through the former mining village of la Grand-Combe and down to the flatter land at Als. This was a coal mining area, with important collieries of high-grade coal both in this valley and at Portes. These mines closed in 1973. There are three notable railways in the commune, one in operation, one under reconstruction and one defunct. The waters of the Gardon d'Als have been tamed by to dams forming two reservoirs. The first, the Barrage de Camboix, was a hydro-electic scheme designed to supplement the power for the coal mines at Grand-Combe, and the second, the barrage de Sainte Ccile, was designed as a holding reservoir to control the violent 'crue' the area suffers when violent storms in the hills send an uncontrolled surge of water down the river flooding low-lying houses and agricultural land.

The commune of Sainte Ccile d'Andorge has a long history. There are some prehistoric remains to be found such as tumuli and some paintings mainly in the hamlet of Ponchets. The current houses date from the 18th century and have been protected from modern development. They are mas built from the local stone schist. Unusually for a village in the fiercely Protestant Cevennes, Sainte Cecile remained Catholic. During the Guerre des Camisards (1702 - 1705), it was the scene of violent action. On 11 October 1703 the villages of Sainte Ccile dAndorge and Saint Julien des Points were set alight by Rolland et Jouanny: 800 to 900 Camisard attacted the papist village of Sainte Ccile dAndorge, enraged by the dvastation of the previous months in the Hautes Cvennes. The residents took refuge in their fortified church but 9 were too slow are were slaughtered. Several days later, Abb Vidal, cur de Sainte Ccile lead a revenge attack on the neighbouring reformed parish of Blannaves[citation needed]. The church tower dates from the 13th century[citation needed]. The principal line, part of the PLM Transcvenol, threads its way along the Gardon valley from Als to Gnolhac to Mende, this section of the line was approved in 1861 and opened 5 May 1870, and provided the link between Languedoc, Als and Issoire and Paris. It hosted three express trains. There is still a twice daily local service. From the station at Sainte-Ccile-d'Andorge there is a 1 metre gauge railway to Florac. It is 49km long.[1] This is known as the TAC. Authorised in 1859, the line was built by the Chemins de Fer Dpartementaux to bring wooden pit props down to Als, with some passenger traffic. This amounted to two trains a day. The track is very winding, and climbs to 1024 m to cross the Col de Jalcreste. It closed in 1968. Enthuiasts are restoring it. They run a passenger pulling diesel locomotive on the first section, which includes the Viaduct d'Andorge.[2] Between 1859 and 1867 there was a gravity driven rail line from the mainline at Le Levade, La Grand-Combe to Portes et Snchas. This was to serve the mines at La Vernarde. The full wagons descending to the river pulled up the empty wagons by a system of cables. It was the idea of the engineer Paul-Adrien Bourdaloue.
