Beyond the Black Stump is an Australian comic strip written by Sean Leahy. It won the "Best Comic Strip" at the 2003 National Coffs Harbour Cartoon Awards and the "Comic Strip Cartoonist of the Year" at the Australian Cartoonist's Association's Stanley Award the same year. The strip follows a cast of Australian wildlife who deal with the day-to-day stresses of marriage, parenting and friendship.
