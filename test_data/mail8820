The Johnathan East Band is a country and southern rock band composed of three members. Johnathan East is the lead singer and guitarist, Jason Cole is the lead bass guitarist, and Mark Truett is the drummer. Born and raised in Clay County, Alabama, Lead singer Johnathan East always had a passion for country music.[1] Johnathan started writing his own songs, singing, and playing the guitar about his southern country life at the age of twelve.[2] All of his songs are coming from true life experiences, customs, and lifestyles that he grew up with. After years of just playing for friends, Johnathan decided to break out in to the local music scene. He played at wedding receptions, birthday parties, and turkey shootings in Lineville, Alabama [3] Playing at local bars and restaurants, locals fell in love with this modern outlaw country singer because of his rebel attitude and genuine style. His first appearance as a musician was at a restaurant called Ajs in Oxford, Alabama.[4] He was soon known over five counties in Alabama and was making it to the top of local musicians. His solo career had become a great success after all the hard work and dedication he put into his infatuation for country music. He released his first album "Grits and Gravy" in 2007 and fans were crazed with his first single, That Ole Ford Truck. His greatest hit so far has been A Little on the Redneck Side on his album One Horse Town released in 2008. He was given the opportunity of performing his original music at The Bluebird Caf in Nashville, Tennessee.[5] He has also entertained his fans at Tootsie's in Nashville, Tennessee.[6] Johnathan has been involved with many other bands in the West Georgia region including Vintage Radio, Alabama, and Bullet Train.[7] Johnathan East earned many outstanding awards including the ACGMA 2007 Male Entertainer of the Year, 2007 and 2008 NACMAI Songwriter of the Year, and NACMAI 2009 Album of the Year Award. He discovered The Crossroads Band in 2009.[8] He rehearsed for long hours and started to perform with The Crossroads Band often and he knew that being with The Crossroads Band was where he was supposed to be.[9] He decided to come together with The Crossroads Band and they created The Johnathan East Band in 2010. The band has been recently touring around Alabama and is currently in the process of producing a new album .
