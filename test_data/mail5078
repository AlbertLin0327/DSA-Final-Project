"New Rose" was the first single by British punk rock group The Damned, released on October 22, 1976. It was the first single by a British punk group,[1] and was released in the Netherlands, Germany, and France in 1977. Written by guitarist Brian James, "New Rose" was issued on the Stiff Records label. The B-side was a cover of The Beatles' hit "Help!", performed about twice as fast as The Beatles's original version. Both songs have since become staples of The Damned's live shows, and appear on various compilations, and "New Rose" was included on the group's full-length debut Damned Damned Damned. The single was reissued in Stiff's mail order Damned 4 Pack mail-order set. Original copies have a pressout centre, while re-issues have a solid centre. Copies from the fourpack have matrix details: "Bilbo tape" handwritten and "AY 50332" prited. A CD version was issued in the Stiff Singles 1976-1977 boxed set by Castle Music in 2003.
