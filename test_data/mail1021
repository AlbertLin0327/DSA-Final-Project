The Battle of reme (also Battle of Ermes) (Estonian: Hrgme lahing; German: Schlacht bei Ermes; Russian:   ; Latvian: remes kauja) was fought on 2 August 1560 in present-day Latvia (near Valga) as part of the Livonian War between the forces of Ivan IV of Russia and the Livonian Confederation. It was the last battle fought by the German knights in Livonia and an important Russian victory. The knights were defeated so thoroughly that the order had to be dissolved. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
