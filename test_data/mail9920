Area code 405 serves the U.S. state of Oklahoma. It covers the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area including cities such as Oklahoma City, Edmond, El Reno, Norman, Stillwater, Shawnee, Chickasha, Tuttle, and Moore. The other three area codes serving Oklahoma are 539 and 918, which cover northeastern Oklahoma (including the city of Tulsa); and 580, which serves western and southern Oklahoma. Area code 405 was one of the original area codes put into service in 1947. Until January 1, 1953, it covered the entire state of Oklahoma. On that date, northeastern Oklahoma was assigned area code 918. On November 1, 1997, 405 was reduced to cover only central Oklahoma, while the southern and western portions of the old 405 became area code 580. As a result, 405 is the only area code in the state that does not reach the Arkansas border. Despite the rapid growth of the Oklahoma City area and the proliferation of auxiliary devices (cell phones and pagers), 405 is likely to remain in its current configuration until at least 2020.[1]
