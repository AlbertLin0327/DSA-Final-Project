"Brothers & Sisters" is a song by Coldplay, released as their first single in 1999 following the release of the bands first EP Safety, released a year earlier. It was later re-released as an EP. After forming in 1998, Coldplay met up with local record label Fierce Panda Records after a representative from said label saw them perform at the Camden Falcon in December of that year. Fierce Panda offered to release their debut single, and the band agreed, signing a short record deal.[1][2] 1,500 copies of the vinyl single were issued in a special wraparound picture sleeve. It peaked at #107 on the UK Singles Chart. According to the singles liner notes, recording completed in only four days and cost the band a lowly sum of 400.[1] The atmospheric sounds on "Easy to Please" were created by setting up microphones on a wet road outside the studio.[2] A new version of "Brothers & Sisters" later appeared on the "Trouble" single. The single was re-released as an EP in late 2002 on Brash Records.
