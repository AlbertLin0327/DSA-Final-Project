Rudolph E. "Rudy" Lapick[1] (17 November 1926  27 February 2004)[2] was an American comic book artist who worked as an inker for Archie Comics for many years. He was nominated for a Shazam Award in 1974 for Best Inker (humor). Rudy Lapick was born in The Bronx, New York City, New York, the son of Rudolph and Florence Lapick. He had a brother, John, and a sister, Gioia. After he married Mary Zema on May 30, 1948, the couple moved to nearby Yonkers, New York. They would have a daughter, Lorraine and two sons, Rudy Jr. and John.[3] Lapick became a staff inker at Timely Comics, the 1940s forerunner of Marvel Comics. In the 1950s, his work included issues of G.I. Joe for Ziff-Davis Comics.[4] He was Dan DeCarlo's primary inker for the majority of DeCarlo's career both at Timely and for decades at Archie. Lapick maintained a long friendship with fellow Timely/Atlas artist Gene Colan, dating to their working together in the Timely art room starting in 1946.[citation needed] Almost five decades later, he inked some of Colan's late-career work at Archie Comics. He was living in Yonkers at the time of his death.[1]
