Kurt Sayenga is a writer, director, and producer living in the Los Angeles area. He was originally active in the Washington, D.C. punk scene, and created, edited, and was the head writer of Greed Magazine in the late 1980s, one of the first magazines to fuse coverage of underground music, literature and "high" and "low" art. On the pop culture side, Greed featured interviews with acts such as Sonic Youth, Pussy Galore, Daniel Johnston, The Swans, Wire, Plasticland, Rites of Spring, Live Skull, and Robyn Hitchcock, plus comics figures Los Bros Hernandez, Charles Burns, Peter Bagge, Chester Brown and Clive Barker. Greed featured the debut of Evan Dorkin's Milk and Cheese in its final issue. Sayenga also designed albums for the Dischord Records label, most notably Fugazi's first six packages: "Fugazi (EP)," "Margin Walker," "13 Songs," "Repeater," "Steady Diet of Nothing," and the 7" "3 Songs." Meanwhile, Sayenga was also building a career as a documentary filmmaker. After a tenure as a writer at C-SPAN, Sayenga went on staff at the Discovery Channel, where he wrote, directed and produced the special "Nighthawk:Secrets of the Stealth Fighter," the mini-series "Wings Over the Gulf," and the 13-part series "Fields of Armor," a survey of mechanized warfare in the 20th Century. He won an Emmy for the design of the opening credits of "Fields of Armor," along with several writing and producing awards. During his time running the production company Arcwelder Films (which he founded with Martha Adams), Sayenga wrote, directed and produced many more documentaries, including "Spies Above," "Robots Rising," "Explosive Situations," "High Speed Impacts," "Inside the Kill Box" (made on the tenth anniversary of the first Gulf War and featuring interviews with players such as George H. W. Bush and Dick Cheney), and the engineering series "Skyscrapers: Going Up," "Bridges: Reaching Out," and "Tunnels: Digging In." He was also show runner of "Animal Nightmares," a 13-part series for National Geographic International, and "Microkillers," a mini-series about pandemic diseases that fused fictional scenarios with documentary content. In 2006 Sayenga formed a new production company called Command and Control Creative Services, through which he has created promotional films for the third installment of the X-Men franchise, X-Men: The Last Stand; the film Lions for Lambs with Robert Redford, Meryl Streep, and Tom Cruise and the remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still. The short films for "Lions" included interviews with such luminaries as Ralph Nader, the Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Amartya Sen, and General Sir Mike Jackson, former head of the British Army. In 2008 Sayenga worked with Bill Nye, the Science Guy, as Executive Producer/Show Runner of "Stuff Happens," for Discovery Communications' Planet Green. He is currently writing and directing films on high-energy particle physics and the Theory of Relativity for the Science Channel series "Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman," premiering in 2010.
