The Bechatw Power Station is a large 5,053MW lignite-fired power station situated near Bechatw in d Voivodeship, Poland. It is the largest thermal power station in Europe, and one of largest fossil fuel power stations in the world.[2] It produces 27-28TWh of electricity per year, or 20% of the total power generation in Poland. The power station is owned and operated by PGE Elektrownia Bechatw S.A., a subsidiary of Polska Grupa Energetyczna. In 2011 a new 858MW unit was commissioned and the total capacity of the power has risen to 5,053MW.[1] The new unit has an efficiency rating of approximately 42%, which is contributing to reduction of both fuel consumption and emissions compared to the existing units.[3] The unit was built by Alstom.[2] Alstom has also carried out the modernization of the low pressure parts in all 12turbines and on 8 April 2009, PGE and Alstom signed a contract to modernise the unit 6.[2] Modernization of another units is planned or ongoing, thus total installed capacity may reach 5,474 MW as of 2015.[1] The station's exhaust is expelled through two 300m (980ft) tall chimneys, among Poland's tallest free-standing structures. Coal for the plant is provided by a large neighboring strip mine. In 2007, the World Wide Fund for Nature ranked the power station as Europe's 11th most relatively polluting power station due to carbon dioxide emissions of 1.09kg per kWh of energy produced, and the highest absolute emitter, with 30.1million tonnes of CO2 per year.[4] In July 2009, the facility was titled as the biggest carbon polluter in the European Union by the Sandbag Climate Campaign, a London based non-profit organization. The report stated that the facility produced 30,862,792tonnes of CO2 in 2008 and after commissioning the new unit the whole generating capacity will have grown by 20%.[5] To reduce CO2 emissions the company plans to introduce carbon capture and storage technology. On 8 December 2008, PGE and Alstom signed a memorandum of understanding according to which Alstom will design and construct by mid 2011 a pilot carbon capture plant at Unit 12. The larger carbon capture plant will be integrated with the new 858MW unit by 2015.[6] The project will be supported by the European Commission with the 180million allocation from the European Energy Programme for Recovery.[7][8]
