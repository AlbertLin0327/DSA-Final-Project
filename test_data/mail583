Daventry Country Park is a country park located on the north-eastern outskirts of Daventry in Northamptonshire, England. It is managed by Daventry District Council, and covers 140 acres (567,000 m). The park centres around a reservoir which is managed by British Waterways and is used to provide water for the Grand Union Canal. The reservoir is a nature reserve and is a popular site for birdwatching, and also angling. Over 180 species of bird have been seen at the park, along with 240 species of flowering plants. There are also circular walks, and picnic areas. Car parking has recently been changed to 2 for any length of time (previously 1 for one hour, and 2 thereafter). The park is very popular with dog walkers and cyclists Coordinates: 521605N 10918W / 52.268N 1.155W / 52.268; -1.155
