Hussein Sirri Pasha (18941960) (Arabic:   ) was an Egyptian politician. He served as Prime Minister of Egypt for three short periods, during which he also served as foreign minister. He first served as prime minister from 1940 until 1942 during the height of Egypt's involvement in World War II as the Germans invaded and were then driven out of North Africa. Sirri next served as prime minister from July 1949 until January 1950, and his final term was for three weeks in July 1952 amidst a political crisis which caused Faruq I to abdicate.
