Punainen jttilinen ("Red giant") is a Finnish small publisher of Japanese manga and Korean manhwa. It was founded in April 2005 by its CEO, Antti Grnlund. However, the publisher was acquired by Tammi in 2009. Nowadays, Punainen jttilinen works together with Sangatsu Manga under facilities of Tammi publishing company.[1][2] Punainen jttilinen is known from their typically large-format, bookstore-oriented releases. The only exceptions this far are Azumanga Daioh and Yotsuba&!, which are in small-format and sold at magazine stands, as is typical for manga published in Finland.
