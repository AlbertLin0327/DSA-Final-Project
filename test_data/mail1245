Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church (also known as Tucker Baptist Church) was an historic church on McCallie Avenue in Chattanooga, Tennessee. It was built in 1899.[1] At one time it housed Tucker Missionary Baptist Church.[2] It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.[1] The building suffered a catastrophic collapse on the morning of May 9, 2010. The building had most recently belonged to The Living Word Ministries, but had been disused for some time. No one was injured.[2]
