Joconde is the central database, now mostly available online, for objects in the collections of the state museums of France, maintained by the French Ministry of Culture. "La Joconde" is the French name of the Mona Lisa, which like almost all the collections of the Louvre, is included in the database, as one of 295 items by, after, or connected with Leonardo da Vinci. Created in 1975, by 2009 Joconde contained over 450,000 object listings online, over 262,000 with images,[3] from more than 282 collections in France,[4] and is still expanding. Live on the French Minitel system from 1992, the database went online to the World Wide Web in 1995. Originally just for objects from the fine arts and decorative arts, in 2004 Joconde was united with what had been separate databases for objects from archeology and ethnology. It comes under the "Direction des Muses de France" (DMF) section of the Ministry. The Joconde listing details are highly structured, using a special vocabulary, which allows for very specific and accurate searches. Search results are displayed 100 to a page, with about 3 items in view at once on a typical PC screen. The full listing ("Notice complte"), which may occupy several screens, is reached by clicking down to a further level. A small number of the best known objects have a prose commentary. Not all images are in colour, especially for the archaeological collections. When objects have no image this is most often for copyright reasons.
