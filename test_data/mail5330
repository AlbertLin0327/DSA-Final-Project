The U-229 is a cable connector currently (as of 2009[update]) used by the U.S. military for audio connections to field radios, typically for connecting a handset. [1] There are five-pin and six-pin versions. This type of connector is also used by the National Security Agency to load cryptographic keys into encryption equipment from a fill device. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
