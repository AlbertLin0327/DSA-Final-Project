The guillotine problem is a problem in combinatorial geometry and in printing. Closely related to packing problems and specifically to bin packing problems, it is the question of how to get the maximum number of sheets of one rectangular size out of a larger sheet, only orthogonal cuts that bisect one component of the sheet are allowed, as on a paper cutting guillotine. The Guilottine problem is important in glass machining. Glass sheets are scored along horizontal and vertical lines and then broken along these lines to obtain smaller panels.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
