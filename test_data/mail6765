He previously worked for West End Games and TSR, Inc., and designed products for Dungeons & Dragons, Star Wars, Alternity, Torg, Paranoia and Ghostbusters. Bill Slavicsek was born and raised in New York City.[1] Slavicsek was a comic book, horror, and science fiction fan as a boy: "Some of my earliest memories involve looking at issues of Marvel Comics, drawing my own comics, and watching old SF and horror movies on TV".[1] Interested in gaming from an early age, Slavicsek was introduced to roleplaying games in 1977 when he discovered Dungeons & Dragons.[2] Originally intending to pursue a career as a comic book artist, Slavicsek switched to journalism and communication at St. John's University.[3] After working for a year at a community newspaper, Slavicsek was hired by West End Games as an editor in 1986.[3] In 1987 the company secured the license to publish a Star Wars roleplaying game, a project which Slavicsek oversaw as an editor and developer.[3] In 1988 he was promoted to Creative and Editorial Director for WEG.[3] He co-created the Torg game with Greg Gorden,[1] published in 1990, and co-authored the novel Stormknights, which was set in the Torg universe.[citation needed] In 1991, Slavicsek began working as a freelancer, and was hired as a designer/editor by TSR in 1993.[1] At TSR, he designed the Alternity game with Rich Baker, as well as the Revised Dark Sun Campaign Setting, and The Nightmare Lands for the Ravenloft setting.[1] "Some of my personal bests include the pair of Planescape adventures I wrote - The Deva Spark and Harbinger House... Planescape brought out the best in the people who worked on it. I'm also extremely proud of the Alternity game system. I worked with a great team that featured my co-designer Rich Baker, editor Kim Mohan, David Eckelberry, Jim Butler, and the great visual contributions of rk post."[1] For much of the 1990s he was working simultaneously for both WEG and TSR as an editor and designer on various projects.[citation needed] He wrote A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, a definitive reference to Star Wars movies, books, and games, which was published by Del Rey in 1994.[1] Slavicsek is considered one of the world's leading experts on Star Wars,[3] and has written the second and third editions of A Guide to the Star Wars Universe. By the end of 1997, Slavicsek was the Director of the TSR Product Group for Wizards of the Coast; that job was later divided in two, making him the Director of Roleplaying Game design.[1] By the time of the publication of the d20 edition of the Star Wars Roleplaying Game in 2000, Slavicsek held the title of Vice President and Director of RPG R&D for Wizards of the Coast.[citation needed] Slavicsek announced his departure from Wizards of the Coast on June 23, 2011.[4] Bill Slavicsek has appeared in the following newspaper and magazine articles, websites and podcasts.
