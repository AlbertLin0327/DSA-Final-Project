1Y96 Gem-associated protein 7 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the GEMIN7 gene.[1][2] The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the core SMN complex, which is required for pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus. The encoded protein is found in the nucleoplasm, in nuclear "gems" (Gemini of Cajal bodies), and in the cytoplasm. Three transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.[2] Gem-associated protein 7 has been shown to interact with SMN1[1][3] and Gem-associated protein 6.[4][1]  Cajal (coiled) body (GEMIN4, GEMIN5, GEMIN6, GEMIN7, GEMIN8, SMN/SIP1, COIL)  Perinucleolar compartment (PTBP1, CUGBP1) Chromatin Dot (PML body) Paraspeckle SMC protein: Cohesin (SMC1A, SMC1B, SMC3) Condensin (NCAPD2, NCAPD3, NCAPG, NCAPG2, NCAPH, NCAPH2, SMC2, SMC4) DNA repair (SMC5, SMC6) Transition nuclear protein: TNP1, TNP2 Nuclear matrix Nucleoplasm Nucleoskeleton Nucleosol LITAF
