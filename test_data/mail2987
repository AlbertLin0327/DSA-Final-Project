Apollo Diamond Inc. was a company based in Boston, Massachusetts that was able to produce nearly flawless single crystal diamond wafers and crystals for potential use in the optoelectronics, nanotechnology, and consumer gem markets. The company used chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for the production of their gem-sized synthetic diamond crystals, and obtained several U.S. patents on the process. The company's techniques were able to produce colorless gems, in contrast to previous diamond-making techniques which usually produced colored diamonds.[1] Many assets of Apollo Diamond were acquired by Scio Diamond Technology Corporation in 2011, which said that it plans to produce synthetic diamond at its South Carolina facility using Apollo Diamond technology.[2]
