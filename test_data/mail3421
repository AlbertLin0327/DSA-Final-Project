There are various interpretation to the origins of the surname Fenech. The most notable one is that Fenech means "rabbit", as fenek is rabbit in Maltese. The word is also thought to be a respelling of Fenich, the German for millet farmer.[1] Another variation is formed from the word Phoenicians. In fact, some bearers of this surname use the horse, a Phoenician symbol, on their crest rather than the rabbit. Another variation is an Anglo Saxon one where it is derived from a family living in Fenwick, which was in Northumberland and the West Riding of Yorkshire. This name was originally derived from the English fenn which means marsh and wic, which means a farm.
