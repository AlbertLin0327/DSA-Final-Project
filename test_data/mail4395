"Hey Girl" is a song written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King, first recorded by Freddie Scott in 1963. It became a hit, peaking at number ten on both the Billboard Pop Singles and R&B charts.[1] In 1966, the Righteous Brothers covered this song on their Soul & Inspiration album from Verve Records. In 1972, the song was covered by Donny Osmond, who is well-known for his chart-topping interpretation of another Goffin/King composition "Go Away Little Girl". Osmond's version reached number nine on the Hot 100, one higher than Scott's original recording. Aside from the above mentioned cover versions, "Hey Girl" has been remade by many artists.
