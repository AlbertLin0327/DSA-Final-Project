Holdemar Menezes (December 13, 1921 - August 19, 1996) was a Brazilian writer. He was born in Aracati, Cear, Brazil, as the 3rd child of Ezequiel Silva de Menezes and Otlia Oliveira de Menezes. He moved to Rio de Janeiro where in 1949 he earned his degree from the Medical School of Rio de Janeiro (Escola de Medicina e Cirurgia do Rio de Janeiro) - his practice was Gynaecology and Obstetrics. After finishing his residency in Rio, he moved to So Francisco do Sul, Santa Catarina and soon after to Florianpolis in the same state. Despite his work as a medical doctor, Holdemar dedicated a great part of his life to writing. Even though he was never a full-time writer he managed to produce quality work and had great impact in the Brazilian literature. In 1972, his work was recognized in Brazil with the Jabuti prize (one of the most respected literature prizes in Brazil) for his book A Coleira de Peggy. For all his body of work, Holdemar is considered an immortal by the Academy of Literature of Santa Catarina (Academia Catarinense de Letras).
