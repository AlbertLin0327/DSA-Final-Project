Nichols & Son, then of Red Lion Passage, Fleet Street, by whom he was advanced to the post of reader. Having saved money he opened a print shop, and gradually accumulated an extensive stock. He is known for his Catalogue of a Collection of Engraved Portraits, comprising nearly 20,000 Portraits of Persons connected with this Country, n. d., 8vo, published at Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, where he died 24 Nov. 1835, aged 46. His widow, Anne E. Evans, and son, Edward David, brought out a second volume in 1853 at No. 403 Strand, whither the business was removed in that year. The two volumes profess to describe about fifty thousand prints, and form a most useful guide to English engraved portraits. His eldest son, Edward David Evans (18181860), mentioned above, carried on the shop in the Strand until his death there on 15 Aug. 1860, aged 42. He was succeeded by his brother and partner, Albert.
