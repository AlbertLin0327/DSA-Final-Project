Hae Mosu was the founder and 1st Dangun of Buyeo. He is mentioned in the Hwandan Gogi, and Korean records of the 11th and 13th centuries that describe the founding of Goguryeo, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Goguryeo considered itself a successor to Buyeo and annexed Buyeo remnants in 494. Hae Mosu was a member of the Go-Joseon Imperial family of Jin-Joseon under the dynasty that was founded by the 44th ruler of Go-Joseon ('Go' = former, ancient), Emperor Gumul of Go-Joseon. He rose up as a general at the young age of 23 under the rule of Emperor Go-Yeolga of Go-Joseon, and served the empire faithfully during its period of decay. Go-Joseon, which had been divided into three separate kingdoms, was falling. Jin-Joseon, the central state and former seat of power, was decaying to the point that the military no longer followed the orders of the Emperor and acted on its own. Seeing that he was no longer in control of the empire, Emperor Goyeolga of Go-Joseon abdicated and left the empire in the hands of the Ohga, who were the Five Central Nobles. Under the Ohga, the generals and leaders of the military began to leave and rise in rebellion. The last to leave the empire was Hae Mosu, who had become general at the young age of 23. Hae Mosu left the Empire in order to rebuild it and not for his own personal gain. Hae Mosu and his battalion went to JangDangGyeong fortress, where they built a palace. From there, Hae Mosu took the title of Cheonhwang-Rang, which was a title equivalent to emperor. Hae Mosu destroyed most of the rebellions of his fellow Go-Joseon generals, and regained most of Jin-Joseon's territories. With this, CheonHwang-Rang Hae Mosu offered the Five Central Nobles a chance to rebuild Go-Joseon under the name of Buk-Buyeo. After establishing the state of Buk-Buyeo, Hae Mosu waited six years just in case the former emperor Goyeolga would return. When it became clear that the former emperor would not return to politics, Hae Mosu was given the title of Dan-Gun.[1] Hae Mosu is stated in Sam-Guk Sagi to have been the father of Hae Buru and King Dongmyeong. These records and the legends involving the three figures conflicted and lacked common sense. Recent studies by historians have solved the puzzle to the Buyeo royal line. Hae Buru was the younger brother of Go Uru, who was the 4th Dan-Gun of Buk Buyeo (buk = north in Korean). When Go Uru died in 86 BCE, his brother Hae Buru took the throne and became Dan-Gun of Buk-Buyeo. Dan-Gun means "king and emperor". However, during that same year, Go Dumak, a descendant of Goyeolga of Go-Joseon (go = former, elder), arose and rebelled against Hae Buru, taking the throne and pushing Hae Buru to the east. Hae Buru led his followers and some of Buk-Buyeo's people to the city of Gaseopwon, a city near the present-day Sea of Japan (East Sea) In that same year, Hae Buru founded another Buyeo, which he named Dong-Buyeo (dong = east in Korean), due to its position east of Buk-Buyeo. In order to avoid conflict with Dong-Myeong Dan-Gun, who had come to rule over Buk-Buyeo, Hae Buru submitted himself to Dong-Myeong Dan-Gun as a vassal of Buk-Buyeo, and therefore used the title of "Wang," which means "King." Go Jumong was the son of Go Mosu, also known as Buliji, who was the ruler of Ok-Jeo. Buliji was the grandson of King Go Jin, who was the second son of Hae Mosu. So Go Jumong was the great-great-grandson of Hae Mosu, Go Mosu met Yuhwa, the daughter of Habaek, who was the chieftain of a tribe that lived by the water. Go Mosu married Yuhwa, but died in battle before he could see their child, Jumong, born. Go Jumong eventually grew up in Dong-Buyeo, and escaped Dong-Buyeo to escape the princes of Dong-Buyeo and their jealous rage. After crossing the border and entering Buk-Buyeo, Go Jumong was greeted by Go Museo Dan-Gun, who was the sixth ruler of Buk-Buyeo. Go Museo Dan-Gun decided to marry Jumong to his second daughter Soseuno. When Go Museo died with no sons, Jumong rose to the throne to become the seventh Dan-Gun of Buk-Buyeo. He eventually conquered many neighboring kingdoms and tribes and established Go-Kuryeo in 37 BCE. According to the Sam-Guk Sagi, Hae Mosu was the father of Go-Kuryeo's founder, Jumong. According to the Sam-Guk Yusa, Hae Mosu was the son of heaven, riding in a chariot of five dragons, arriving at Holseng-Golseong in 58 BC to establish Buk-Buyeo (North Buyeo). His son is the founder of Go-Kuryeo, Dong-Myeong-Seong. It is also said that Hae Mosu was an excellent archer and skilled fighter who conquered many foes of his kingdom, Buk-Buyeo. However, Hae Mosu does not appear in older Chinese records or on the Gwang-Gaeto Stele that describe Go-Kuryeo's founding. It is thought that Go-Kuryeo integrated the founding legend of Buyeo after the former conquered the latter. Hae Mosu Dangun died of age in the year 195 BCE.
