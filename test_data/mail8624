The politics of Sichuan Province in the People's Republic of China is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China. The Governor of Sichuan is the highest ranking official in the People's Government of Sichuan. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Sichuan Communist Party of China Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the "Sichuan CPC Party Chief".
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
