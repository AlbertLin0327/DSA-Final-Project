Ingomar is an unincorporated community in Merced County, California.[1] It is located on the Southern Pacific Railroad 10.5 miles (17km) northwest of Los Banos,[2] at an elevation of 92 feet (28 m).[1] A post office operated at Ingomar from 1890 to 1921.[2] The name was probably from the play Ingomar, the Barbarian.[2] 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
