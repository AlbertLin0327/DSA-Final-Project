Content:
An IgA protease is a highly specific 106kDa enzyme that claves amino acid sequences of certain proteins. The natural substrate of IgA proteases are the inmunoglobulin A, hence its name. The enzyme is in fact capable of cleavage of proteins with the amino acid sequence Cleaves N-X-Z-Pro-Pro/-Y-Pro-C, where the X in the squence preferably is a Proline or Serine; the Y = Threonine, Serine or Alanine; and Z preferably is Arginine or Threonine. Because of the sequence that the enzyme is able to cleave, it is also called IgAse Pro-Pro-Y-Pro. Thus, the IgA protease act by cleaving the proline-rich hinge region of the heavy chain of IgA1. Three major bacteria, Neisseria gonorrhae (which causes gonorrhea), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae type B, releases the IgA protease which destroys IgA.[1]
