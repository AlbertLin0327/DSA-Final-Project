The Northern Ireland men's national volleyball team is the national volleyball team of Northern Ireland. They have only competed once in Round One January 2005 of the FIVB World Championships with QUB Graduate Gerry Ford as Head Coach and UUJ 's Nick Wright as captain. They do compete in the CEV European Small Nations division. In 2012 the Junior Men finished 5th in the Finals in Scotland and the Junior Women 3rd in their Qualifier on Malta. However, in the lead up to the 2012 Summer Olympics in London none of the Home Nations will compete individually other than Small Nations Divisions.[1] David Hamilton and Patrick Crooks are currently members of the GB development squad in the build up to London 2012 with David recently securing a professional contract with Tenerife Sur VC.
