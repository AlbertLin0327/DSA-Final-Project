The 2009 NAB Cup is the Australian Football League pre-season competition that was played before the Australian Football League's 2009 Premiership season begins. It culminated with the Final on 13 March 2009 played between Geelong and Collingwood and was won by Geelong. The Final was originally scheduled for 14 March 2009 but was moved by the AFL so that the match did not clash with the Sound Relief benefit concert for the Victorian bushfires.[1]     The NAB Cup of 2009 has generated a greater amount of interest than previous years.[citation needed] The 2nd game of Round 1 featured an Essendon v Western Bulldogs match at Etihad Stadium dedicated to the Black Saturday bushfires. The competition also created headlines for a scheduling error that saw the upcoming 2nd round match between Collingwood v Richmond (at Etihad Stadium) clash with the A-League Grand Final 2009, with the AFL handing over the right to Melbourne Victory. This match was later transferred to a Thursday Night, and featured the long awaited return of fallen AFL star Ben Cousins, for the Richmond Tigers.
