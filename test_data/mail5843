The second season of Pinoy Dream Academy formally began on June 14, 2008. Nikki Gil and Toni Gonzaga reprise their roles as hosts of the show, but Gonzaga now handles the main hosting plum while Gil appears both on the Probation Nights and Little Dreamers Gala/Expulsion Night. Billy Crawford has joined this season as the host of the late afternoon edition Pinoy Dream Academy berture.[1] A new logo is also used for this season, having an old-fashioned microphone and the word "Dream" using a different font than the rest of the title. Also, a new version of the theme song Awit ng Pangarap sang by first season winner Yeng Constantino is being used for this season, although the original version was also used, especially during Gala Nights. New to this season was a "Little Dreamers" competition for children aged 6 to 10. On July 6, 2008, twelve children were chosen to become the Academy's resident Little Scholars.[2] In this end, a new puppet named Billilit (portmanteau of "Billy" and bulilit or kid) joins the show as semi-host and Billy's sidekick on bertube as far as any topic regarding this side competition is concerned. The Little Dreamers competition continued for several weekends after the season finale of the second season for the "adults" on September 13 and 14, 2008. The Little Dreamers took part on the said season finale despite this. The competition ended on October 5, 2008 at the Dolphy Theatre of the ABS-CBN building. The Little Dreamers competition was started on July 6, 2008, for children who are six to ten years old. Twelve children were chosen to compete in this side competition, taking place within the duration of this season. Understandably, they do not stay at the Academy due to regular schooling on weekdays, entering it during weekends to have voice lessons from the Voice Mentors. Each week, the scholars will sing songs that fit a specific weekly theme. The dates shown are the dates of the Gala Nights. Resident Juror Guest Jurors In this part of the competition, the Little Dreamers also go through an elimination process where each week a scholar would be expelled from the Academy. Due to the fact that they are children, grades are never stated. Instead a scholar who is the "Outstanding Little Dreamer" (counterpart of the Star Scholar) is picked out; sometimes two are picked out if they have the same grade on the judges' score cards. Two students are labeled "Needs Improvement" and therefore become probationary students, one of which would be expelled. Class cards are distributed to the Little Dreamers prior to the start of their Friday class. The ones who get a "star" are safe from being a probationary student and the Little Dreamers who get the letters "N. I." (which stand for "Needs Improvement") are the probationary students and are subjected to viewers votes. The process of elimination for this side competition is similar to the older scholars; however, the probationary students are revealed to the viewers at the beginning of the Gala Performance Night. Voting is opened at the start of the show and is closed at the end of the Gala Performance Night, when one of the Little Dreamers with "N.I." marks is expelled from the Academy. On the 7th Gala Night, it was announced that the next Gala Night will be the Back To School Round wherein the six expelled scholars will have the chance to return to the competition and once again battle it out for the title of Little Grand Star Dreamer. ^Note 1: In the Back-to-School Week, the Top 6 Little Dreamers didn't perform. The six expelled scholars performed on stage and the jurors graded them. Based on those grades, Shane and Jerome were given the chance to once again battle it out and be part of the Top 8. ^Note 2: The Top 8 scholars performed and no expulsion took place. The following week had no Little Dreamers show to give way for the Grand Dream Nights of Pinoy Dream Academy Season 2. ^Note 3: Due to having parotitis, Amy was unable to perform live, as prescribed by her doctor. However, the footage of her rehearsal with the live band was aired. Though she wasn't able to perform live, she is still a part of the Top 6 for being one of the Outstanding Little Dreamers last week along with Philip.
