Deanna C. C. Peluso (born 1980) is a Canadian musician, composer, music educator, author and researcher currently residing in Vancouver, B.C.. She has been the Project Coordinator for the RYME - Research For Youth, Music and Education project since 2009, and also does field research for the SSHRC funded research project. Peluso combines her academic and experiential background in music, psychology, performance art, technology and education within her research, publications and artistic practice. Peluso holds bachelors degrees in both Music and in Psychology from Simon Fraser University, from the Faculty of Contemporary Arts and from the Faculty of Psychology.[1] Peluso also holds a Masters of Education in Educational and Organizational Leadership from the University of Victoria (UVIC), where her research on the motivations, benefits and persistence for mature students to pursue their graduate degrees led to her writing a book on her research and findings.[2] Peluso is an active participant in academic conferences in media, music and psychology,[3] and her research focuses on various projects and foundations where an importance is placed on music education and on developing Arts-based education.[4] Peluso's research has also dealt with the fields of Cognitive Psychology and Memory studies.[5] Her most recent research has been focusing on Music Education and Media literacy, as seen in her 2010 talks at the Media Literacy Conference in London, UK, as well as her focus at RYME - Research For Youth, Music and Education.[6][7] Peluso's recent research has been featured on the Congress 2011 of Humanities and Social Sciences which is organized by the Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences. An article on Peluso's research as a part of RYME discussed how the research group is bringing forth a new outlook on childhood education, the arts and the media.[8] This article also recapped Peluso's and her colleagues' presentations at the Congress, and quoted Peluso as saying that Teachers facilitate the role of exploring these [technological and artistic] opportunities, learn from kids and offer youth empowerment. Everyone has knowledge of what the next person doesnt. Peluso currently conducts educational research seminars and workshops on the Use of Technology within Academia and Educational Settings, Social Networking, Icebreakers and Music within the Classroom.[9] Peluso also lectures on technology in education and using technology within artistic practice.[10] In her workshops, Peluso uses a multi-sensory approach to teaching, rather than an oral lecture format. Peluso has also been involved in teaching music to adult learners and learners with disabilities, by using various Arts based techniques, such as the exploration of acoustic awareness through photography or painting. Peluso is current located in the Faculty of Education at Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C. working on a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Arts Education.[11][12] In addition to her research in Music Education and Media literacy,[7] she is the Project Coordinator and a member of the ongoing research project, RYME - Research For Youth, Music and Education, which is a Simon Fraser University research project that looks at youth participation and enagement in musical activities.[13][14] Peluso is involved in other music education organizations, such as the Canadian Music Educators Association (CMEA), where she is a blog contributor and web administrator for the CMEA's Research to Practice blog.[15][16][17] Peluso is a published author of the book "Motivation, Purpose and Persistence: Pursuing a Leadership Degree: A Study Of Graduate Students' Motivations To Pursue A Degree In Educational Psychology and Leadership Studies".[18] The book is published by Dr. Mller Aktiengesellschaft & Co. located in Saarbrcken, Germany, which specializes in publishing books in the research industry. The book is a documentation of a qualitative and quantitative study of the motivations, support systems and reasons for students to persist in their graduate studies in Education.[19] The book looks at the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations to commence and continue graduate studies, such as the external support systems of family or funding, the psychological barriers and the potential personal and financial benefits of completing a Masters or Doctoral degree in Education. Since a majority of the participants within the study in the book were educators, mainly teachers in the K-12 education system, the study was important in its search to discover the motives of the educators to pursue their post-graduate education, and whether the educators were more interested in personal growth or in financial gain by job advancement due to their additional degree and experience. Peluso continues to publish articles in various journals and academic publications on music education and the online environment.[20] Peluso has been involved in various musical and performance groups since 2000, though according to her website, due to health problems in late 2008 onward,[21] she does not seem to be active in any particular musical group or organization. Peluso has been composing for over 20 years, but is best known for her performed works that occurred between 2000 and 2007 inclusive. Peluso has an eclectic collection of written compositions written during and after the years she studied music composition at Simon Fraser University. During her Music Composition degree, Peluso collaborated with dancers, filmmakers, actors and with other performing artists to fuel her experience in the field, in music education and to build upon her 14 years of studying and performing Classical period music.[22] Former professors, mentors and teachers included Martin Gotfrit, David McIntyre, and Owen Underhill. Peluso has composed music for not just sole instrumental performance, but has been involved in composing music for dance, theatre and various other performing art installations within the Vancouver area. It seems that her music, artworks and online presence typically are signed under the pseudonym or nickname  dccp.[23] Incomplete Selection, 2003-onward Peluso composed a piece for the Vancouver Symphony orchestra, The Music Box Circus, which was performed in 2006 during the Jean Coulthard Readings[28] at the Orpheum Theatre. Due to Maestro Bramwell Tovey being away due to an unknown cause on the day of the reading session, the piece was conducted by Maestro Kenneth Hsieh. The Music Box Circus includes the entire orchestra in its orchestration, and is about 5 minutes 20 seconds in length - It is unknown whether Peluso has revised the piece since the 2006 performance. The Sonic Boom Festival is an annual composers festival each spring located at the Western Front in Vancouver, B.C.. Peluso's compositions have had numerous performances at this Performing Arts festival that showcases various composers and musicians from across Canada. Peluso's compositions have varied from a string trio, a saxophone quartet, to eclectic mixes of accordion, cello and percussion. Peluso has been a performer in various Performing Arts festivals and shows. She has performed music for independent film, dance accompaniment, theatre performances and numerous collaboration projects involving the fine and performing arts. Peluso has been an active participant in the Arts community, both in solo performance and as a part of musical groups or collaborations with theatre, dance or film. During 2003, Peluso performed for the first time as a participant in the In The House Performing Arts Festival, as a musician for the theatre group "Un/Stuck", which featured actors from the Greater Vancouver Regional District. In 2003, with the same theatre troupe she performed at Nextfest 2004, the Performing Arts Festival in Edmonton, Alberta. In 2005, among her schedule of musical performances as a part of dance and performance art shows, she performed with Gamelan Alligator Joy, a performance group that plays a combination of traditional and contemporary Javanese Gamelan.[29] Peluso performed with the same performance group at various other events around Vancouver, B.C. throughout 2005 and 2006.
