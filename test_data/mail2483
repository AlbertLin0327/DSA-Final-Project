Hobby Lobby is a privately held retail chain of arts and crafts stores based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and is formally called Hobby Lobby Creative Centers. The Company was founded by David Green on August 3, 1972, and as of March 2012 the chain has 502 stores in 41 states. Hobby Lobby headquarters are located in a 3,400,000-square-foot (320,000 m2) manufacturing, distribution and office complex. Stores do not use a barcode system and therefore rely on the hand pricing and ordering of items. The Website states they do not feel it is right for us at this time.[1] Hobby Lobby delivers the same music to its individual locations via satellite from headquarters. This music blends light jazz, classical, bluegrass, and contemporary music styles (a large percentage of the chosen music is instrumental adaptations of traditional Christian hymns) into one single playlist which loops continuously. [2] Hobby Lobby locations have general operating hours from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday to Saturday. Except for the Distribution Center on certain days during the winter holiday season, all locations are closed on Sundays, out of respect for the founder's Christian beliefs.[3] References to Christianity are often made in their stores and advertisements.[4] Full page ads are purchased in each location's local papers on Christmas & Easter each year. This is in addition to the sales ads that are published each week, also on a Sunday in most areas. Hobby Lobby Creative Centers is not related to Hobby Lobby International, a dealer specializing in radio controlled model aircraft.
