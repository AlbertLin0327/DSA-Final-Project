Nikolina Piek (born 8 April 1976) is a Croatian TV presenter with Nova TV. She occasionally also works as TV actress. Piek was born in Zagreb, SR Croatia, SFR Yugoslavia. Her television career began in her mid twenties after graduating design from the University of Zagreb's Faculty of Architecture. She made a name for herself within Croatia by appearing on various frivolous entertainment, gossip, and lifestyle programmes on HRT, Croatian public broadcaster. First, it was the show named Glamour Cafe, created by Sinia Svilan, that consisted of two co-hosts Piek and Nina Skorup doing bits and interviews with a lot of gossip, innuendo, and overt sexuality.[1] Somewhat provocative nature of the show combined with the duo of physically attractive young female hosts turned a lot of heads.[2] When Glamour Cafe got taken off the air, Piek landed on another HRT gossip entertainment programme called Shpitza, this time as co-host alongside Danijel Despot. Shpitza's main competition was similarly conceptualized Red Carpet programme on the rival Nova TV station. By now a recognizable public personality in Croatia, Piek hosted HRT Dora in March 2007, Croatian selection for the Eurovision Song Contest. She started getting bit acting offers as well, which led to her appearance on Bitange i princeze series. Further cementing her local star status was her fall 2007 participation as contestant on the second season of Ples sa zvijezdama, Croatian version of Strictly Come Dancing, airing on HRT.[3] Shpitza somewhat ran out of steam and frequent changes at the male co-host position ensued. Despot got replaced by Mario Petrekovi, but he quickly gave way to Luka Buli. However, the show started losing viewership rapidly and got taken off the air in late 2007.[4] In early 2008 Piek co-hosted a youth-oriented talk show Na domaem terenu with Mirko Fodor, also on HRT. In late summer 2008, she left HRT and moved to Nova TV, Croatian private TV station, thus reuniting with Sinia Svilan who in the meantime became a head of programming at Nova. Once there, she started hosting the entertainment show named Red Carpet Light.[5] Arguably her biggest break came in late September 2008, almost simultaneously to her network switch, when she was announced as one of the four hosts of Operacija Trijumf (local Star Academy version for the five Balkan countries that used to be a part of Yugoslavia) alongside Milan Kalini, Ana Mihajlovski, and Maca Marinkovi. Weekly appearances on the hugely popular 3-month long reality singing contest that aired on 6 networks and was seen by a large audience throughout Balkans led to surge of popularity for her as well as expanded career opportunities outside Croatia. Among those are co-hosting the 2009 Pjesma Mediterana festival in Budva with Ognjen Amidi during early June 2009 and being slated to appear in a recurring acting role in a Serbian sitcom.[6] Simultaneously throughout the first part of 2009 she continued appearing on Nova TV programmes. She worked as studio co-host on Farma reality show alongside Mia Kovai and Draen "Kocka" Kocijan. Piek also took over for Ana Stuni hosting IN magazin. She is also acting in drama series Najbolje godine In 1997, during a relationship with Mark Cigoj, journalist who wrote for Globus magazine at the time, Piek gave birth to their daughter Hana. The relationship with Cigoj subsequently ended. From 2007 to 2010, Piek dated the professional scuba diver Kristijan Curavi. As of 2011[update] she is dating Matija orkovi.[7]
