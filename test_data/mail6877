Macdonaldtown railway station is a minor CityRail station in the city of Sydney. It is the second station on the Inner West line heading away from Central, being preceded by Redfern and followed by Newtown. The Macdonaldtown locality is actually within the suburb Newtown, with an entrance from the railway underpass on Burren Street. It is located opposite the CityRail yards at Eveleigh and adjacent to the Illawarra junction (the junction between the main west and Illawarra lines). A nearby stabling yard is known as the Macdonaldtown turnback which has been recently expanded by Clearways Project. Six sets of railway tracks pass through the station, but there is only one island platform - on the 'local' tracks. A station opened at Macdonaldtown on 15 April 1878, at a site adjacent to the Charles Street subway.[1] The Main Suburban Railway Line through Macdonaldtown was quadruplicated in 1892[2] when the station was moved to its present site,[1] and sextuplicated in 1927 in association with electrification works.[3] An island platform on the middle pair of tracks was taken out of use and demolished in November, 1985.[4] The closed access stairs to this may still be seen from the underpass entrance. The station is served by two to four trains per hour each way, with additional trains during weekday peak hours. During off-peak hours two of these four train services towards Regents Park terminate in Ashfield. Entrance and bridge Entrance Under bridge Entrance and ticket office Tunnel leading to exit
