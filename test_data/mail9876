Seawall Boulevard is a major road in Galveston, Texas in the United States. The boulevard is conterminous with Farm to Market Road 3005 south of 61st Street. It runs along the Gulf coast waterfront of the island near the main parts of the city. It is named for the Galveston Seawall built along the beaches. The sidewalk adjacent to Seawall Boulevard on the south is claimed to be the longest continuous sidewalk in the world at 10.3 miles (16.6km) long.[1] Seawall Boulevard is home to several hotels and entertainment venues including the famous Hotel Galvez and Flagship Hotel.[2] During Galveston's Open Era the road became quite famous as a lavish, nationally known tourist venue and casino district featuring elegant hotels and clubs. The boulevard's prominence began with the construction of the club and casino Maceo's Grotto (later called the Balinese Room) in 1929.[3] Other famous locations on this road included Murdoch's Bath House, the Buccaneer Hotel, the Pleasure Pier, and the Mountain Speedway roller coaster.[4] The boulevard became the focal point for tourism events such as the International Pageant of Pulchritude of the 1920s, the first international beauty contest.[5][6][7] The event would be held on the beach in front of the seawall attracting tourists from around the nation and media attention from around the world. Other events along the boulevard included the spectacular Mardi Gras parade and celebration. This era of prosperity declined during the 1940s and ended in the 1950s with the closing of the casinos by the Texas Rangers.[8]
