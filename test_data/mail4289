Kathie L. Olsen is an American neuroscientist who is noted for her work in scientific policy. Between August 2005 and January 2009, she was the Deputy Director and Chief Operating Officer of the National Science Foundation. Olsen obtained a B.S. degree in biology and psychology in 1974 from Chatham College, graduating with honors. She then obtained her doctoral degree at the University of California, Irvine in neuroscience in 1979 with her doctoral thesis, titled Hormonal mechanisms controlling the development and regulation of male-female differences. Upon obtaining her doctorate she accepted a postdoctoral fellowship at the Department of Neuroscience at Children's Hospital Boston of Harvard Medical School. Olsen became Senior Advisor in the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s Office of Information and Resource Management on January 18, 2009. In this position, Olsen advises the Foundation's Chief Human Capital Officer as well as NSF senior management on opportunities for NSF-wide management improvement in areas such as strengthening merit review and interdisciplinary research processes, workforce planning, Program Officer training and development, and succession planning. Prior to her current appointment, Olsen was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as the Deputy Director and Chief Operating Officer of NSF in August 2005. As such, she was responsible for the day-to-day management and oversight of program creation and administration; national and international collaborations; merit review processes; strategic and long-term planning and performance; budget development, implementation and reporting; personnel; and operations. Olsen joined NSF from the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) in the Executive Office of the President where, since 2002, she had been the Associate Director and Deputy Director for Science. Her responsibilities included overseeing national and international science and education policy development and federal agency program coordination for the physical sciences, life sciences, environmental science, behavioral and social sciences and education. Prior to OSTP, Olsen served as Chief Scientist for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (May 1999-April 2002) and the Acting Associate Administrator for Biological and Physical Research (July 2000-March 2002). As Chief Scientist, she served as the Administrator's senior scientific advisor, principal advisor on budget content of the scientific programs and principal interface with the national and international scientific community. As Acting Associate Administrator during the formulation of the new Enterprise for Biological and Physical Research, she oversaw budget development and implementation, recruitment and development of professional and support staff and strategic planning.
