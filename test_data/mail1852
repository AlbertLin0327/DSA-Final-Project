Rehuel Lobatto (June 6, 1797  February 9, 1866) was a Dutch mathematician. Lobatto was born in Amsterdam to a Portuguese Marrano family. As a schoolboy Lobatto already displayed remarkable talent for mathematics[1]. He studied mathematics under Adolphe Quetelet coediting "Correspondance Mathmatique et Physique." Working for the Dutch government he became secretary of a statistical commission in 1831.[2] In 1842 he became a teacher at the Polytechnical School of Delft. The Gauss-Lobatto quadrature method is named after him.
