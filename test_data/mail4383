108 is an American hardcore band founded in 1991. Their music reflected the Hare Krishna faith of its members.[1] Their name comes from the number of beads on the Japa mala, or mantra counting beads.[2] After splitting from the Zack De La Rocha-fronted band Inside Out, guitarist and Hare Krishna devotee Vraja Kishor das (aka Vic DiCara) formed 108 in 1991. While recording an EP, Rasaraja dasa (aka Rob Fish) joined on vocals. Following in the footsteps of the Cro-Mags and Antidote, they made sure to place their Krishna Consciousness at the forefront of their music.[3] Their first records, Holyname and Songs of Separation, were released on Equal Vision Records. These releases were followed by their participation in two documentary films, 108: The Final Tour[4] and N.Y.H.C.. Following a prolonged break-up where DiCara relocated to India to become a monk, they planned to reform at Hellfest in 2005. Due to legal issues, that festival was cancelled at the last moment but 108 successfully re-booked special gigs in Philadelphia. They self-released a collection of demos and b-sides followed by a new full-length recording entitled "A New Beat From a Dead Heart" with Deathwish Inc.[1] On March 23, 2010, before the release of 18.61, it was announced that Rob Fish had quit the band, discontent with the band not being able to "redefine" its ties to faith.[5] (Rob and Vic were no longer part of ISKCON by the time of the bands reformation.[6]) The remaining members of the group later released the following statement: "108 has not broken up. Rasaraja [aka Robert Fish] has left the band, but 108 will continue in full force with a new direction and focus. We will be writing, recording and playing shows this year to support 18.61 and create new music."[7] It was later revealed in September 2010 that Rob Fish had rejoined the band.[8]
