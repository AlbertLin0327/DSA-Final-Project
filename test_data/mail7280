Louis Nippert (1903-1992) was majority owner of Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds from 1973 to 1980. Nippert was an heir to the Procter & Gamble fortune. In 1966, he bought into the Reds as part of the ownership group led by Francis L. Dale. He bought majority control in 1973, and was at the helm for the Reds' most successful era, in which they won the World Series in 1975 and 1976. Generally, Nippert was a hands-off owner. He largely left the team in the hands of general manager Bob Howsam. In 1980, Nippert sold his interest to a group headed by minority owners William and James Williams. For a time, Nippert was also a limited partner with the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals Obituary in The New York Times
