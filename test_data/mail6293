What Am I Doing in the Middle of the Revolution? (Italian: Che c'entriamo noi con la rivoluzione?, also known as Qu nos importa la revolucin!) is a 1972 Spaghetti Western comedy film. The title should be understood, according the director Sergio Corbucci, as "What Am I Doing in the Middle of the Western Cinema?".[1] It is the final chapter of the Corbucci's trilogy about the Mexican revolution, after The Mercenary and Compaeros.[1][2] The film mixes comedy and political apologue.[3]
