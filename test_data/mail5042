The Dragon Group is directly responsible for the establishment of the sweater industry in Bangladesh, which now contributes about US $1.5 billion per year from export. The Dragon Group first established its sweater factory by the name Cheung Hing Sweater in the 1980s with 50 Chinese technicians, about 300 machines and about 600 employees. Today, the Group employs over 12000 employees with 10000 machines and exports about 10 million sweaters per year. The group is among the world's largest sweater suppliers and is the largest sweater industry in south and southeast Asia. The Group's Chairman is Mostafa Golam Quddus, who is a former President of BGMEA[clarification needed], and is widely known as the Father of Bangladesh's sweater industry.[citation needed] The day-to-day operations are overseen by Managing Director Mostafa Quamrus Sobhan.
