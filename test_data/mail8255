Angus Monfries (born 19 January 1987) is an Australian rules footballer currently playing for the Essendon Football Club in the Australian Football League. Monfries plays forward pocket or half forward. Monfries was drafted by the Bombers with selection 14 in the 2004 AFL draft. He played football for Walkerville Junior Football Club before moving to Melbourne. He made his debut in Round 1, 2005 against Melbourne, which saw him become the 200th player to have played under coach Kevin Sheedy.[1] Monfries maintained his position in the senior side until Round 4, but was dropped for the Anzac Day clash in Round 5, against Collingwood and was not seen at senior level again until Round 12. In Round 13 against St Kilda, he kicked two goals and, alongside other young Bombers, played a role in a fifteen point win. He then went on to play every game for the remainder of the season. In 2006, his second season, Monfries played 21 games, missing only one game due to a minor calf strain. In 2007, Monfries played 20 out of 22 games, omitted on form for two weeks at midseason.[2] He was, however, named as an emergency for both matches and quickly returned to the team due to pressures caused by injuries and suspensions to other key players.[3] In 2009, Monfries became a key player within the Essendon squad. He defined his role further as a key position forward and finished second in the club's goalkicking after Matthew Lloyd. Since his debut, Monfries has worn the No. 6 jumper, a number previously worn by well-known Essendon players such as Sean Wellman (19962004), Anthony Daniher (19871994) and Neale Daniher (1979-1981 & 1985). Monfries was named Most Courageous Player at the 2006 Crichton Medal (Essendon Best and Fairest). At the 2008 Best & Fairest, he won the 'Striving For Excellence' award, an award given to the budding elite of the club. Having settled in Melbourne, Monfries is currently studying a degree in Journalism at La Trobe University. He has currently started doing radio broadcasts of VFL club Bendigo Bombers' games for the official Essendon website.[4]
