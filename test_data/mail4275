Randy Colley (born May 2, 1950) is a retired professional wrestler better known as Moondog Rex.[1] Colley competed in the World Wrestling Federation, where in 1981 he won the WWF Tag Team Championship with Moondog King (later replaced by Moondog Spot) as the Moondogs. In 1984, Rex had a WWF Title shot against Hulk Hogan on the Canadian television tapings that aired on both Maple Leaf and All-Star wrestling. Shortly after debuting as the original Demolition Smash in early 1987, Colley was replaced by Barry Darsow because of a contract dispute that led to him leaving the company (in addition, Colley's face was visible even with the makeup, causing fans to chant "Moondog" when he was in the ring). Colley was placed in a short-lived tag team with Jose Luis Rivera, who would go on to become one half of the Conquistadors. This new team was known as The Shadows. He had a long singles run on top in Mid South as "The Nightmare" and "The Champion" managed by both Eddie Gilbert and Sir Oliver Humperdink. After Demolition ended for him in the WWF, he went to Continental where he worked as Detroit Demolition. He was able to do this because he was co-creator of the original gimmick. His biggest career feud was in Memphis where the Moondogs had a series of wild, bloody main event matches with the Fabulous Ones. In 1991 World Championship Wrestling (WCW) created a stable known as "the Desperados" consisting of Dutch Mantell, Black Bart, and Colley, who played "Deadeye Dick". The Desperados were packaged with the gimmick of being three bumbling cowboys looking to meet Stan Hansen to go to WCW and become a team. Over the course of a few months, they were promoted through a series of vignettes by which they were beaten up in saloons, searched ghost towns, and rode horses. Hansen reportedly wanted no part of the storyline and left for Japan, never to return to wrestle in North America. Without Hansen, the group were dissolved as a stable before the end of the year. In 1994, Colley was called as a prosecution witness in the Vince McMahon steroid distribution trial on Long Island, New York.[3]
