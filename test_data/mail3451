Gerald Braheen Moses (born August 9, 1946 in Yazoo City, Mississippi) is a retired American professional baseball player. A catcher, he signed a bonus contract with the Boston Red Sox in 1964 and spent his early Major League Baseball career with the Bosox, but over the course of his nine years in MLB Moses would play for seven different teams. He batted and threw right-handed, stood 6feet 3inches (1.91m) tall and weighed 210 pounds (95kg). Moses first appeared briefly with the Red Sox in 1965 at age 18 due to his bonus status, but soon returned to the minor leagues for more seasoning. He made the majors for good in 1969, and in 1970 Moses served as Boston's first-string catcher and was selected to the American League All-Star team. But after that season, he was included with Red Sox slugger Tony Conigliaro in a blockbuster trade to the California Angels. He did not win the Angels' starting catcher job and batted only .227 in 1971, and then began his career as a journeyman, never spending more than one full season with the Angels, Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees, Detroit Tigers, San Diego Padres and Chicago White Sox. He did serve as Detroit's regular catcher in 1974. All told, Moses played in 386 major league games and collected 269 hits.
