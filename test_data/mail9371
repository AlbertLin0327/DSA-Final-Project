Claude A. Watson (June 26, 1885  January 1978) was a lawyer, businessman, and minister from Hermon (a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California), who was nationally active in the temperance movement. He was the Prohibition Party candidate for vice-president of the United States in 1936 and was the party's presidential candidate in both 1944 and 1948. A certified pilot, Watson was the first American presidential candidate in history to fly his own airplane and flew over 16,000 miles campaigning.
