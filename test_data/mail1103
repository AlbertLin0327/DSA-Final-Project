Results from Norwegian football in 2005. Vlerenga won the 2005 Premier League, while Aalesunds FK and FK Bod/Glimt were relegated. Molde FK had to play two qualification matches against number Moss in the first division (for the last spot in next year's season. Molde won the qualification matches. The greatest surprises of the 2005 season were the great performance of IK Start, promoted to the Premier League in the 2004 season and ended up winning silver, and the disappointing performance of Rosenborg BK which fought against relegation from the Premier League after winning it for 13 straight seasons. The season ended on a sad note as Fredrikstad's Dagfinn Enerly got a serious neck injury in the last round match against Start.
