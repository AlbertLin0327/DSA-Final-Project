These are the daytime Monday-Friday schedules on all three networks for each calendar season beginning in September 1992. All times are Eastern and Pacific; affiliate schedules may differ. Talk shows are highlighted in yellow, local programming is white, reruns of prime-time programming are dark orange, game shows are pink, soap operas are chartreuse, news programs are gold and all others are light blue. New series are highlighted in bold. Note: Santa Barbara aired its final episode on January 15, 1993. The following Monday, NBC returned the 3PM timeslot to its local stations. Many affiliates had already dropped the show by the time it was canceled. Note: CBS returned the 10 AM hour to its affiliates beginning September 13.
