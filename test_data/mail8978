The Rambla of Montevideo is the avenue that goes all along the coastline of Montevideo, Uruguay. Since all the southern departments of Uruguay are against either the Ro de la Plata or the Atlantic Ocean, they all have ramblas as well. La Rambla, South of the Gulf of Montevideo, provides a great environment for people to do a big variety of activities, such as jogging, walking, biking, fishing, fly kites, or simply drinking mate with someone and taking a sunbath. Skateboarding and roller skating are also possible in special areas for these activities. The avenue is secured by the Tourism Police Unit during the summer to keep a safe environment for the tourists. Building anything across the rambla, on the side of the beach, which is 100% state-owned, is regulated since that would ruin the view.[citation needed] Along the coastland of Montevideo, the Rambla, previously called Rambla Naciones Unidas in its entirety, has taken on several denominations: The Rambla is an integral part of Montevidean identity. That is why it has been included by Uruguay in the Indicative List of World Heritage sites, equalling a candidacy to such a distinction.[7]
