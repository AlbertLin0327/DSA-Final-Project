Laciana, Tsaciana in Leonese language, is a comarca in the province of Len, Spain. It had 11,904 inhabitants in 2005. The rivers of this comarca flow towards the Atlantic Ocean. Local people speak a certain variant of the Leonese language known as Patsuezo. Many areas in Laciana were degraded in the past by open-pit mining and mining-related contamination. This comarca was declared a Biosphere Reserve in 2003. The predominant language is Castilian which coexists with the native Leon variant[1] [2] known as the Patsuezu language[3] . Despite being endangered, there are various efforts being made to revitalize the traditional dialect of the area. A book entitled Street Cries of the Villablino Festivals by Emilce Nez was written about these efforts. The region is an eminently mining region that has been hit by the economic crisis. Now it is committed to finding economic alternatives for the future. It is the headquarters of the steel mining companies Ponferrada, 8 HCCSA and 9 HBG (Hijos de Baldomero Garcia Viloria Group.
