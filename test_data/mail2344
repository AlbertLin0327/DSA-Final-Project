Weienseer FC is a German association football club from district of Weiensee in the city of Berlin. The clubs roots go back its founding on 8 September 1900, while more recently it has been linked with Sportverein Prussia Berlin and Pankower Fuball Verein Bergmann-Borsig .[1]  FC was part of the Mrkischen Fuball-Bund, an early Berlin-based football league, where they captured the title in 1904. They finished as vice-champions three years later, but left the MFB to join the Verband Berliner Ballspielvereine as a third division side. They quickly rose to second class play and the following year won the city cup. Weiensee advanced to the first division where they would remain until 1918. They won their way back to top-flight city competition in 1922 and, with the exception of the 192627 season, stayed there until 1931. The club grew during this time to include departments for athletics, boxing, and hockey. German football was reorganized under the Third Reich in 1933 and 16 regional top-flight divisions were formed. WFC found they were no longer competitive and they failed to break into the Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg. Following World War II, Germany was occupied by the victorious Allies and the Weiensee district was part of the Soviet zone in Berlin. Existing sports and football clubs were dissolved. New clubs were soon formed and Sportgemeinschaft Weiensee Ost was established as the successor to FC. In 1951, the team was playing third tier football in the Stadtliga Berlin Ost as ASV Weissensee before being renamed Blau-Weiss Weissensee in 1953. It was standard practice in East Germany for clubs to have a sponsorship relationship with a local industry, service or government body as a Betriebssportgemeinschaft and in 1956 Blau-Weiss became BSG Einheit Weiensee. They played under that name until 1990 at the Bezirksliga (III) and Bezirksklasse (IV) levels. Following the reunification of Germany the system of state sponsorship of sports clubs disappeared and clubs sought out other financial support. Einheit was reformed in 1990 as SG Eumako Weissensee with the support of an insurance company. Now part of the single German football competition the team was part of the Landesliga Berlin/2 (VI) and in 1991 advanced to the Verbandsliga Berlin (V). The club's sponsorship deal with Eumako was only good for two years and ended in 1993. The season ended with Weissensee relegated after a 15th place finish. In June 1993, the decision was made to join SV Prueen Berlin, a large sports club without a football department. They played the 199394 season as SV Prueen and earned a 9th place Landesliga result. Shortly after becoming part of Prueen, that club merged with bankrupt side PFV Bergmann-Borsig which was part of fourth tier competition in the Oberliga Berlin. The footballers had the choice of either taking the place of PFV in the city fourth division or leaving the club. A number of players left and the team slipped to lower division play. Now once again part of the Landelsiga Berlin/2 and playing as Prueen Berlin they earned a ninth place result in 199394. Shortly afterwards the bankrupt club PFV Bergmann-Borsig also joined SVP. The footballers had the choice of either taking the place of PFV in the city fourth division or leaving the club.
