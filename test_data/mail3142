Integration is the third studio album by American rapper Kellee Maize. It was released on November 11, 2011 and was recorded primarily in her home studio aka Nakturnal Studio. Its musical styles range from Reggae to Dubstep to Electro Pop.[1] The content of the LP explores the idea of having a good balance between the dualities in human nature (i.e., Good & Evil).[2] The album received positive reviews and launched her to: - 2 million+ YouTube views - 70,000+ Twitter and Facebook fans - 200+ media mentions - 400K+ free album downloads - #1 on Amazon.com and #1 on Frostwire.com [3] Integration was downloaded over 160,000 within its first month of release. One reviewer at Frostclick said, Although the album is more personal and infused with the artists spiritual perspective, it doesn't alienate listeners at all. Kellee manages to not only put her best foot forward but blinds and impresses as she does. [4] The first single, Hasta Abajo, peaked at #7 on Jamendo.[5] Maize performed multiple tracks from the LP at the albums release party in Pittsburgh at a local middle eastern inspired performance venue.[6]
