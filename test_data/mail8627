Maass' 1901 death during yellow fever experiments attracted national attention.[2] In 1956 a new building was completed in Belleville, New Jersey, which is sometimes referred to as "The Hospital in the Park" due to its location opposite Branch Brook Park.[3] In 2009, the hospital was staffed by over 550 physicians with 1,600 total employees.[1]
