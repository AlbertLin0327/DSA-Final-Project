Frisco is an affluent city in Collin and Denton Counties in the U.S. state of Texas and a rapidly growing suburb of Dallas. As of the 2010 Census, 116,989 people were living in Frisco up from 33,714 in the previous census (72,489 in Collin County and 44,500 in Denton). Frisco was the fastest growing city in the United States in 2009,[3] and also the fastest growing city in the nation from 2000-2009.[4] In the late 1990s, the northern DallasFort Worth Metroplex suburban development tide hit the northern border of Plano and spilled into Frisco, sparking explosive growth into the 2000s. Like many of the cities located in the booming northern suburbs of Dallas, Frisco serves as a bedroom community for many professionals who work in the DallasFort Worth Metroplex. Since 2003, Frisco has received the designation "Tree City USA" by the National Arbor Day Foundation.[5] In 2007, Frisco received the National Arbor Day Foundation Growth Award for the third year in a row. This award recognizes environmental improvement and encourages a higher level of tree care and tree preservation within the community. A 2007 Forbes study named Frisco as the seventh-fastest growing suburb in the United States.[6] When the Dallas area was being settled by American pioneers, many of the settlers traveled by wagon trains along the old Shawnee Trail. This trail was also used for cattle drives north from Austin. This trail later became the Preston Trail, and later, Preston Road. Preston Road is one of the oldest North South Roads in all of Texas. With all of this activity, the community of Lebanon was founded along this trail and granted a U.S. post office in 1860. In 1902, a line of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway was being built through the area, and periodic watering holes were needed along the rails for the steam engines. The current settlement of Lebanon was on the Preston Ridge and was thus too high in elevation, so the watering hole was placed about four miles (6km) to the west on lower ground. A community grew around this train stop. Residents of Lebanon actually moved their houses to the new community on logs. The new town was originally named Emerson, but that name was rejected by the U.S. Postal Service as being too similar to another town in Texas. In 1904, the residents chose Frisco City in honor of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway on which the town was founded, later shortened to its present name. Frisco is located at 330829N 964847W / 33.141263N 96.813120W / 33.141263; -96.813120 (33.141263, -96.813120).[7] Frisco is considered to be part of the humid subtropical region. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 70.0square miles (181.4km2), of which, 69.9square miles (181.0km2) of it is land and 0.2square miles (0.4km2) of it (0.23%) is water. As of the 2010 Census[8], there were 116,989 people living in Frisco, up from the previous census[1] in 2000, with 33,714 people. In 2000, there were 12,065 households, and 9,652 families residing in the city. The population density was 482.4 people per square mile (186.3/km2). There were 13,683 housing units at an average density of 195.8 per square mile (75.6/km2). By 2010[9], there were 42,306 housing units, 39,901 households, and 31,226 families. 62% on the Collin County side and 38% in Denton County. 67% of households were married couples living together, 8.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 21.7% were non-families. 17.5% of all households were made up of individuals and 2.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.93 and the average family size was 3.35. 51.7% of households had children under the age of 18 living with them. The age distribution is 33.3% under the age of 18, 4.9% from 18 to 24, 13.9% from 25 to 34, 22.5% from 35 to 44, 20.0% from 45 to 64, and 5.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33.9 years. According to a 2010 American Community Survey[10] estimate, the median income for a household in the city was $100,868, the median income for a family was $109,086. The per capita income for the city was $38,048. About 2.2% of families and 5.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.5% of those under age 18 and 2.4% of those age 65 or over. Like many Dallas suburbs, Frisco is accumulating a tremendous number of retail properties, including Stonebriar Centre (opened August 2000), a 165-store regional mall, and IKEA (opened 2005), a furniture store with an area of 28,800 square meters (310,000 sqft). Retail establishments and restaurant chains line Preston Road, which is one of the major north-south-running traffic arteries in the city. Frisco took a different economic track than many surrounding cities and elected to use a fractional percent of local sales tax to fund the Frisco Economic Development Corporation (FEDC) rather than DART, the regional transportation body. The effectiveness of the FEDC, whose primary purpose is to reallocate such tax dollars to commercial ventures, is a matter of public debate. Frisco also built Frisco Square, a mixed-use development that will become the new downtown. Frisco Square has about 250 rental residential units, seven restaurants, about 40,000 square feet (3,700m2) of commercial office space and a few personal service locations. The major development in the project is the new City Hall and main library and a public commons. A Cinemark theater opened in December, 2010. A hospital will soon be opened north of the Cinemark. [11] According to the City's 2010 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[12] the top employers in the city are: Frisco is a "Home Rule" city. Frisco voters adopted its initial "Home Rule" Charter in 1987. In May 2002, Frisco residents voted to revise the Charter and approved 19 propositions. The form of government adopted by Frisco is the Council-Manager, which consists of a Mayor and six City Council members elected "at-large" and a City Manager. Council members' duties include enacting local legislation (ordinances), adopting budgets, determining policies and appointing the City Manager and City Secretary. According to the citys most recent Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the citys various funds had $227.2 million in Revenues, $184.4 million in expenditures, $1,647.0 million in total assets, $753.1 million in total liabilities, and $159.3 million in cash and investments.[12] The structure of the management and coordination of city services is:[12] Most of Frisco is a part of the Frisco Independent School District.
