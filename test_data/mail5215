Tamar Getter (Hebrew:  , born in Tel Aviv, 1953) is one of the prominent artists of the Israeli avant-garde and fine arts teachers.[1] Getter studied with Raffi Lavie in 1971-1972, and soon after began to exhibit her works and gain recognition as a promising young Israeli artists. Her subjects were mythical, such as the myth of Tel Hai. She worked in mixed media (e.g., photography and drawing) and adopted various perceptions of space in one work. This collaged approach, and the use of different, alien components to deal with "heroic" subjects distinguishes her art. Getter also studied literature at Tel Aviv University.[1] In the early 80's Getter's works were longitudinal and panoramic and had a Baroque dimension in the openness of their composition.[2] Getter lives in Tel Aviv.
