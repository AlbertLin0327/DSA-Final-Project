The Wall (11,108 feet (3,386m) is located in the Teton Range in the U.S. state of Wyoming, running for more than 4 miles (6.4km) along the western border of Grand Teton National Park.. The peak is on the border of Grand Teton National Park and the Jedediah Smith Wilderness of Caribou-Targhee National Forest.[2] This high point, near the northern terminus of the cliff, is 1 mile (1.6km) WSW of South Teton and overlooks Snowdrift Lake.
