The ERA Mini Turbo is a modified Mini city car that was produced by Engineering Research & Application Ltd. under the ERA brand from 1989 to 1990. The fastest-ever official production Mini, it has been described as "the spiritual successor to the Cooper and the 1275 GT".[1] To create the car, ERA installed a turbocharged Austin Rover A-Series 1300 MG Metro engine, which produces 94bhp (70kW) at 6200rpm, in a standard Mini and modified the body, suspension, brakes, water and oil cooling systems, and interior. The body kit was styled by Dennis Adams,[1]who also designed the Marcos sports cars and the Probe concept car. The car, which uses mostly Austin Rover components, was marketed through Austin Rover dealers.[1] The interior has MG Metro front seats trimmed in Connolly hide, VDO instruments in an ERA-designed dash panel, pile carpeting, and a sunroof. Torque steer, common in a front-wheel drive layout, is mitigated by greater front-wheel toe-out and specially-made lower front suspension arms that provide 1.5 degrees of negative camber. The 6 x 13 aluminium alloy wheels are intended for either Goodyear or Dunlop 165:13:60 section, HR-rated low-profile tyres. The wheels are tested for impact and fatigue, and fitted with a disc-type knave plate and tamper-proof lock. The servo-assisted braking system has Metro ventilated discs and four-pot calipers at the front, with modified drums at the rear. The car has adjustable shock absorbers all round, and the ride height is lowered. A total of 436 ERA Mini Turbos were produced.[1]
