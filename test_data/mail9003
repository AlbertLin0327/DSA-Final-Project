Captain Norman Cyril Jones was an English flying ace during World War I. He was credited with nine aerial victories. Norman Cyril Jones was born in Cheshire, England.[1] His birth date is unknown; however, he would have to been born prior to 1897 to be old enough to be commissioned into the military at the start of World War I in 1914. Norman Cyril Jones was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 2nd East Lancashire Brigade on 14 September 1914.[2] He was promoted to lieutenant in the Royal Horse and Field Artillery on 1 June 1916.[3] On 8 June 1917, second lieutenant Jones was appointed a Flying Officer in the Royal Flying Corps; this appointment customarily marked graduation from pilot's training.[4] From 21 June19 August 1917 he was posted to 71 Squadron while it was in Warwickshire.[5] In late 1917, he was assigned to 28 Squadron in Italy. He scored his first aerial victory while with them, on 25 January 1918.[6] On 30 January 1918 Jones was appointed a Flight Commander with the temporary rank of Captain.[7] He subsequently transferred in theater, to 45 Squadron, where he resumed his winning ways on 19 May 1918. He would run his score to nine by 21 August 1918.[8] He earned a Distinguished Flying Cross for his courageous service. It was gazetted on 21 September 1918: Needless to say, the award citation was based on incomplete information, as Jones' victory list shows. See also Aerial victory standards of World War I On 23 January 1919, Lieutenant Norman Cyril Jones was placed on the RAF's unemployed list.[12] His assignment to the RAF was ended and he was returned to the Royal Horse and Royal Field Artillery of the Territorial Force.[13] He gave up his commission on 30 September 1921.[14] As Jones exited the military, he moved into the business world. He was involved in the reorganization of the family business in March 1920, which established John Jones as Chairman.[15] He rejoined the RAF for World War II; on 23 February 1941 he was commissioned as an Acting Probationary Pilot Officer for "the duration of hostilities...."[16] Despite his military duties, he was a personal representative to the estate of John Jenkyn Jones, deceased 30 November 1943.[17] Norman Cyril Jones retired from the firm of Cox & Deakin on 1 April 1974.[18]
