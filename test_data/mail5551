Newsday is a news programme on BBC World News that first premiered on 13 June 2011.[1] The programme is co-hosted by Babita Sharma (Monday-Wednesday) and Kasia Madera (Thursday/Friday) in London, with Rico Hizon and Sharanjit Leyl in Singapore. The programme is broadcast around the world on BBC World News, as well as PBS affiliates in America, and is also shown in the UK on the domestic BBC News Channel throughout the night, with the 2am and 3am UKT bulletins also shown on BBC Two and the 4am UKT bulletin also shown on BBC One. It gives international news with a specific focus on Asia and its financial markets.  Newsday is aired from 0100-0500 GMT on weekdays on BBC World News.[2] The programme acts as a morning programme for Asia, an overnight broadcast in Europe and the UK and a late night news programme for the Americas. It features analysis and discussion of the top news stories of the day and also previews the exclusive reports, correspondent feature films and interviews. In between commercial breaks for international viewers, UK and PBS viewers get news from around the UK "in brief" with the London presenter. The programme features split presentation, with a presenter in London and a presenter in Singapore each introducing reports and interviewing occasional guests in-studio. The London presenter also presents links for UK viewers during commercial breaks, while the Singapore presenter goes on to present Asia Business Report at the bottom of each hour. On occasion the programme broadcasts from another location, such as in January 2012 when World News America anchor Katty Kay co-presented Newsday from Des Moines, Iowa, during the Iowa caucuses.
