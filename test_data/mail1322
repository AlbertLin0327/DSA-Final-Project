Quintanilla Vivar is a municipality located in the province of Burgos, Castile and Len, Spain. From the early 1991's the city itself has led to the recovery of the population, with many people, work and city life, but has found a home in the village at a better price in the city. According to the 2009 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 741 inhabitants.
