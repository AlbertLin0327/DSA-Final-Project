Carol J. Shaya-Castro (maiden name Carol Shaya) is a former New York City police officer and actress whose employment was terminated after she appeared in the August 1994 issue of Playboy magazine. Shaya was born in Jaffa, Israel and emigrated to America as a child.[1] Her religion is Greek Orthodox.[1] Her father[2] and ex-husband[3] also worked as police officers. In August 1994 Shaya, a NYPD officer, appeared nude in Playboy. On October 28, the NYPD filed departmental charges against Shaya, for unauthorized off-duty employment and improper use of her uniform and the Police Department logo.[4] On March 7, 1995, Commissioner William J. Bratton dismissed Shaya-Castro, saying her appearance in Playboy violated the City Charter and the department's rules, so she was unfit to be a police officer. In response, Shaya-Castro sued the department for US$10,000,000 for wrongful dismissal and gender discrimination. In her claim, she said that other, male, officers who appeared in pornographic films, not just softcore pictorials, were merely suspended, and not fired. [2] Her lawsuit was criticized by Stanley Crouch in an American Enterprise Institute speech.[5] The case, Shaya-Castro v. New York City Police Department, 649 N.Y.S.2d 711 (1996). , was decided against her, and upheld on appeal.[6] In 1994, Shaya appeared in bit parts in two episodes of the television police drama, New York Undercover. Shaya also starred in the direct-to-video Silent Prey in 1997. In August 2004, the New York Times reported Shaya was selling real estate in the Queens borough of New York City.[7]
