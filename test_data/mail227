The following is the list of the Roman Catholic dioceses of France since December 2002. See also the List of Ancien Rgime dioceses of France and the List of French dioceses in the 19th and 20th century for information prior to 2002. The map of the French ecclesiastical provinces was provisionally reshuffled in 2002, on order to coincide more closely with the map of French administrative regions. This meant the creation of a few new metropolitan archbishoprics. This also entailed, for several archbishoprics, the loss of their metropolitan status: their bishops nevertheless retained the title of archbishop. As a result of history, many former bishop's sees were united, mainly as a consequence of the French Revolution. Hence the fact that many dioceses bear the name of several cities. When it is the case, only the first one is the place where the bishop actually resides. In France, most dioceses coincide with a dpartement, but there are a few exceptions when some arrondissements are attached to a diocese outside the dpartement, or form a separate diocese within the dpartement (this happens mainly in dpartements with numerous population, such as Nord or Bouches-du-Rhne). Along with the list of the new ecclesiastical provinces and their suffragan dioceses, this list also gives the equivalent of the diocese jurisdiction in departmental terms.
