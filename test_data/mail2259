Mariastein.png Mariastein is the smallest municipality in the Kufstein district and is located 4 kilometers north of Wrgl and 11.5 kilometers southwest of Kufstein. It became a place of pilgrimage after a local statue of Mary, which had been removed to Bavaria in the late seventeenth century was said to have returned to the church in Mariastein on its own. At the center of the community is a 42-metre-tall Wohnturm, a castle built in the fourteenth century atop a rock outcropping, and which contains 150 stairs. It is now a museum.
