Kaduqli (Arabic:  Kduql) is a capital city of South Kurdufan State, Sudan. It is located 149 miles (240km) south of al-Ubayyid, at the northern edge of the White Nile plain in the Nuba Mountains. It contains Hilal Stadium. Kaduqli came under Egyptian rule in the early 19th century and was probably a centre for recruiting slaves for the Egyptian army.[citation needed] It is now a trading centre for gum arabic and livestock. Industries include textiles, soap factories, and the production of leather. Kaduqli is also the Headquarters of Sector IV of the UNMIS (United Nations Mission in Sudan). The sector IV HQ houses the Egyptian Contingent and also includes the Indian Aviation Contingent, flying MI-17 helicopters.
