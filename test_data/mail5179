The following is a list of characters in the manga series The Candidate for Goddess by Yukiru Sugisaki. Zero Enna ( ( ), Enna Rei?) (his real name "Rei" is the kanji representing number 0) lost his father when he was very young and was raised by his mother on a remote colony. Cheerful and optimistic to the extreme, Zero hides his fears and refuses to ever be depressed. His straightforward and optimistic personality sometimes grates on others. A bit thickheaded, he's not the smartest candidate, but he can move with the best of them. His piloting abilities are like carbon that hasn't yet been formed into a diamond. Zero hasn't yet mastered his EX. Hiead Gner (, Hido Gun?) was orphaned in the war and forced to suffer many hardships, but has a strong hatred for anyone raised in comfort. Cold and seemingly emotionless, he doesn't trust anyone or anything, especially Zero. These rivals share the same EX abilities. Clay Cliff Fortran (, Kurei Krifu Ftoran?) is the class brain and came to the G.O.A. not to be a pilot, but to study and theorize. Interested in many different subjects. His catch phrase is "Very interesting." Roose Sawamura (, Ruzu Sawamura?) used to be chubby, but his Repairer Wrecka put him under a rigorous diet and made him slim. He seems to have some feelings for her. Yamagi Kushida (, Yamagi Kushida?) lived in a colony that was closed down and no one lives there anymore, but he still dreams about his family living there and, worried about him, awaiting his return. He wants to become a Pilot to protect people so they won't have to experience the same dreams as he. Force Wartlliam (, Fsu Wtoriamu?) paired up with Hiead in the training to master the basics of the Pro-Ing. After the teams were separated, Hiead challenged him to a duel and, as result of Hiead's EX going rampant, he got badly hurt. Aracd Narocke (, Arakudo Narokku?) paired up with Clay in the training to master the basics of the Pro-Ing and fought against Zero and Erts' pair. His objective was to defeat Erts, the best of the five top pilots, but Zero got in his way. Erts Virny Cocteau (, tsu Wirun Kokuto?) is the best of five top pilots. Orphaned very young and forced to enter the G.O.A., Erts is gentle and doesn't like to fight. His grades are very good and Erts is Zero's friend. Erts has an older brother that is a pilot, Ernest Cuore. He later becomes a Goddess Pilot in his brother's place. Kizna Towryk (, Kizuna Turku?) is the personal Repairer for the practice ingrid Zero pilots. Kizna wants to be Zero's equal, and not inferior to him. Sometimes, Kizna talks like a man, but because of her rational personality, the other mechanic girls in her class look up to her. She has dexterous fingers and makes an excellent mechanic. She really likes sweet things. Kizna has artificial fox (or cat) ears because in her childhood, she had an accident that damaged her ears. Ikhny Allecto (, Ikuni Arekuto?) is Hiead Gner's Repairer. Timid and seemingly low in self-confidence, Ikhny is gifted in repair and seeks acceptance from the brutal Hiead, even to the point of once sabotaging Zero's Pro-ING. Tukasa Kuscha (, Tsukasa Ksha?) is Yamagi Kushida's Repairer. Wrecka Toesing (, Rekka Tshingu?) is Roose Sawamura's Repairer. Saki Mimori (, Saki Mimori?) is Clay Cliff Fortran's Repairer. Kyoko Farley (, Kyko Fr?) Yukine Simmons (, Yukine Shimonzu?) Rome Lotte (, Romi Rotto?) is Erts Virny Cocteau's Repairer. She had to drop her position when Erts became a Goddess Pilot and chose to carry his brother's will. Teela Zain Elmes (, Tra Zain Erumesu?) is the best of the five Goddesses and the only female pilot. Faithful to her task, Teela's fighting ability is frighteningly high. Nearly flawless, there are times when no one quite knows what she's thinking. Seeking perfection, she won't let herself feel the emotions of daily life. Her outward appearance has hardly changed since she saved the ten-year-old Zero, but no one knows why. Always the top of the pilots, Teela has two EX. One is the same ability as Zero's. The other is the ability to control other Ingrids. Gareas Elidd (, Garusu Eriddo?) is the second best of the five Goddesses and is in charge of attacking. When he's in the right mood, Gareas has matchless strength; when he's not, he can't hit the broad side of a barn. He doesn't like Teela (since she took his position as top pilot). Strong, quick-tempered, and violent, he has a nasty way of speaking and acting and is constantly ignoring orders. Gareas is a womanizer who's always competing with Rio. The oldest of the pilots, he has a relatively strong build. Despite their vast differences, Gareas is good friends with Ernest. Rioroute Vilgyna (, Riorto Wirujina?) is what's called a cheerful idiot, even though he has a rather arrogant personality. But he's easily the most gentle pilot and most easily moved to tears. Quite the flirt, he is always competing with Gareas. He seems like a player, but he secretly only likes his mechanic, Philphleora. Rio recognizes Teela as the leader. He tends to say, "--ssu." A contraction of "desu" which indicates he's not showing as much respect as he should. Rio's body is fit and toned. He's the fourth in a big family. His little brother,is expected to soon enter G.O.A. Yu Hikura ( ( ), Yuu Hikura?) is quiet and usually emotionless, but quite strong-willed. Like Gareas, he is also in charge of attacking. Because of his calm judgment, the other pilots have great trust in him (his skills are also top notch). He has a rather young face and light complexion, and has a small build. There are rumors to the effect that, while enrolled in G.O.A., he nearly killed his instructor. When his home colony was attack by Giseisha, he and his sister Kazuhi were rescued by the previous five Goddesses. To him, the most precious thing is his only family, his little sister. Ernest Cuore (, nesuto Kure?) is submissive and kind to everyone, but has a complicated side that, while being lonely, likes his solitude. With his polite, careful way of speaking, Ernest is always the mediator if something bad happens between the Candidates. His EX is telepathy, which has caused a hard time for him when associating with others. But after meeting Gareas at G.O.A., he started to look at things positively. Ernest dislikes his EX and often wonders why he has it. In battle, he uses his EX to support the Ingrids so they can fight with 120% of their power, as well as being in charge of operations. Erts is his little brother. Leena Fujimura (, Rna Fujimura?) is Gareas Elidd's Goddess Repairer. Her name is the same as Gareas' Ingrid, and seems to worry and care a lot about him. Philphleora Deed (, Firuforeira Ddo?) is Rioroute Vilgyna's Goddess Repairer. She cares a lot about Rio, even though she doesn't let it show and says she worries much more about Agui Keameia, his Ingrid. Tune Youg (, Chn Ygu?) is Ernest Cuore's Goddess Repairer and also is in love with him. Apparently, she was jealous of Ernest and Gareas' relationship. As said in episode 8, even though her heart was only filled with thoughts of Ernest, he wouldn't look at her at all and would open his heart only to Gareas. She later becomes Erts Virny Cocteau's Goddess Repairer, losing the opportunity to tell Ernest how she really felt about him. Kazuhi Hikura (( ), Kazuhi Hikura?) is Yu Hikura's Goddess Repairer and also his sister. She doesn't like rough people, and said so to Rio when he tried to flirt with her. Azuma Hijikata (, Azuma Hijikata?) is the captain of the transports and sometimes is the scary instructor who shows Candidates the right way. He's the one responsible for personally training Zero, Hiead, Clay, Yamagi and Roose. He's a smoker and also a very serious person, but also somewhat hot headed, and seems to hate when people call him "old man". He's the top insructor in G.O.A., a first class. Dr. Rill Croford (, Riru Kurofdo?), also called Madonna in White, is the main doctor at the medical station. Dr. Kuro Rivolde (Dr., Dr. Kurou?) Headmaster (, Kouchou?) is the headmaster of the school.
