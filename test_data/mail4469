Pilot Boy Productions is a television production company founded by comedian and actor Dave Chappelle. The company works on shows and standup performances starring Chappelle. The company logo is taken from the Roots DVD cover in one sketch from Chappelle's Show. Following the credits of Chappelle's Show it is accompanied by the phrase, "I'm rich, Biatch!" This was later revealed to be from Donnell Rawlings' character in the reparations skit.
