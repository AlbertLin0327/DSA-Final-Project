Authenticit was an official state ideology of the Mobutu regime that originated in the late 1960s and early 1970s in what was first the Democratic Republic of the Congo, later renamed Zaire. The authenticity campaign was an effort to rid the country of the lingering vestiges of colonialism and the continuing influence of Western culture and to create a more centralized and singular national identity. The policy, as implemented, included numerous changes to the state and to private life, including the renaming of the Congo and its cities, as well as an eventual mandate that Zairians were to abandon their Christian names for more authentic ones. In addition, Western style attire was banned and replaced with the Mao-style tunic labeled the abacost and its female equivalent. The policy began to wane in the late 1970s and had mostly been abandoned by 1990. Not long after Mobutu Sese Sekos declaration of the beginning of the Second Republic following his successful coup on the failing democratic government of President Joseph Kasa-Vubu, he declared his new nationalistic ideology in the Manifesto of NSele of May 1967.[1] Over the next several years, Mobutu gradually instated the various policy measures that would come to define the campaign. More than anything, the retour  lauthenticit was an effort on behalf of the self-declared father of the nation to create a national identity that could take precedent over regionalism and tribalism while reconciling those claims with the exigencies of modernization. He described the ideology as follows: Authenticit has made us discover our personality by reaching into the depths of our past for the rich cultural heritage left to us by our ancestors. We have no intention of blindly returning to all ancestral customs; rather. We would like to choose those that adapt themselves well to modern life, those that encourage progress, and those that create a way of life and thought that are essentially ours.[2] Though continually glorified by Mobutu and his statesmen, the authenticity campaign was the means through which the dictator intended to vindicate his own brand of leadership. He himself, in an effort to link his ideology and his political dominance, stated just before proclaiming authenticit that, in our African tradition there are never two chiefs.That is why we Congolese, in the desire to conform to the traditions of our continent, have resolved to group all the energies of the citizens of our country under the banner of a single national party, despite the necessity of a lessening of tribal identity in order to promote national unity.[3] Greatly a result of Mobutus 1973 visit to Beijing, Zairian males were strongly urged, and then required, to abandon Western suits and ties for the Mao-style tunic that he named the abacost, a word derived from the French  bas le costume, or "down with the suit." A female equivalent of the national attire was also created. The most widely recognized result of authenticit was no doubt the renaming of the nation from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Zaire, a Portuguese mispronunciation of the Kikongo word nzere or nzadi, which translates to: "the river that swallows all rivers." It is generally unknown why the head of state chose a Portuguese colonial name instead of an authentic Congolese name.[4] Mobutu also renamed the Congo river and the national currency Zaire, and referred to them as Les Trois ZNotre Pays, Notre Fleuve, Notre Monnaie (The Three ZsOur Country, Our River, Our Money). In addition, cities renamed appropriately Kinshasa (formerly Lopoldville) and Kisangani (formerly Stanleyville). Streets, bridges, and other geographic features, as well as the armed forces received name changes. Zairians were urged to drop their Western or Christian names in favor of Zairian names.[5] For example, Mobutu changed his own name from Joseph-Dsir Mobutu to Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga (more commonly Mobutu Sese Seko). Under the state and party ideology of authenticity, all citizens were equal and the appropriate term of address among all Zairians became citoyen, or citizen. The term was mandated for public use in order to do away with the perceived hierarchical distinctions of monsieur and madame. Visiting heads of state were greeted with African drumming and singing as opposed to the 21-gun salute, traditional in Western practice.[6] The state urged that all traditional works of art be returned to the country so as to inspire Zairian artists and ensure the incorporation of traditional styles into contemporary artwork.[6] The Catholic hierarchy quickly came to view the retour  l'authenticit as a threat to Christianity in Zaire (in the early 1990s almost half of the population was Catholic). The regimes stress on mental decolonization and cultural disalienation could be interpreted as an attack on Christianity as a product of Western influence, as could the emphasis on African culture as an alternative to widespread continuing Westernization. Also, the banning of Christian names was a measure that particularly offended the church.[5] As part of his re-organization of Zairean life, Mobutu banned all outside Christian religious groups, requiring those who would function in Zaire to become part of one of four recognized umbrella groups. The four were: the Kimbanguist Church (a syncretic church of Zairian origin), the Catholic Church, the Orthodox Churches, and Les glises du Christ au Zaire (ECZ, now Church of Christ in Congo), which covered most of the Protestant confessions. All others were illegal. The various Protestant churches had to affiliate with the last of these as Communities within the ECZ in Zaire. At the time there were numerous local sects and church groups which had sprung up, and it is believed Mobutu wanted to control these, as well as the churches in general. (Source: Personal experience working in one of the Communities within the ECZ, 198384). Although many of the changes instated as part of authenticit lasted nearly to the end of the Mobutu regime or beyond it, the ideology had begun to wane by the late 1970s as it could do little more to benefit Mobutus kleptocratic regime. Along with Mobutu's announcement of the transition to the Third Republic in 1990, which included most notably a three party system, came the freedom to return to more universal forms of address and to wear a suit and tie. Also, by the 1990s many Zairians had resumed use of their given names.[5] After Mobutu was forced to flee the country amidst the First Congo War in 1997, President Laurent Kabila returned the countrys name to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
