"Bro's" is the second single from the Person Pitch album by Animal Collective solo artist Panda Bear. The song's main riff is a sample from The Tornados' song "Red Roses and a Sky of Blue." The second half of the song features a guitar part from Cat Stevens' "I've Found a Love" from his debut Matthew and Son, and contains a sampled lyric from The Equals' "Rub a Dub Dub."
