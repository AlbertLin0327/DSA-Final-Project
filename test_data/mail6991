Kazuo Uzuki is the subject of a baseball card issued by Topps as an April Fools' Day hoax. The card was released on February 6, 2008 of a supposed high school superstar named Kazuo "The Uzi" Uzuki. In Japanese, Kazuo Uzuki means "the first son of April." The person actually depicted on the card was a New York University law student named Sensen Lin. He is listed as 5'11" and 165lbs and could supposedly throw a 104mph pitch. According to the card, Uzuki would be the first Japanese player to go straight from high school in Japan into professional baseball in the United States. The Uzuki rookie card was found in one out of every 72 packs of cards.[1] When the card was released, people did not know that it was a joke and the card was trading for around $10$15 on eBay. It was even the "card of the day" when it was released.[2]
