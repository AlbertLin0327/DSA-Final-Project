The Kansas District is one of the 35 districts of the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod (LCMS), and comprises the state of Kansas; one congregation near the state's northern border is in the Nebraska District. The Kansas District includes approximately 163 congregations and missions, subdivided into 16 circuits, as well as 37 preschools and 16 elementary schools. Baptized membership in district congregations is approximately 60,000. [1] The Kansas District was formed in 1888 out of the Western District, and at various times included territory in Colorado, Oklahoma and New Mexico; portions of the district were separated into the Colorado District (later renamed the Rocky Mountain District) and the Oklahoma District in 1921 and 1924 respectively, and the New Mexico areas were later transferred to the Colorado District in 1941-42. Kansas District offices are located in Topeka, Kansas. Delegates from each congregation meet in convention every three years to elect the district president, four vice presidents, circuit counselors, a board of directors, and other officers. The Rev. Keith Kohlmeier has been the district president since 2003, and was reelected to a third term in 2009. The last convention was held June 4-6, 2009 in Topeka, KS under the theme "Encourage, Raise Up, and Motivate One Another in Christ," from the Acts of the Apostles. [2]. The next will be held in June 7-9, 2012 in Topeka, KS with the theme "Mercy, Witness, Life Together". [3]
