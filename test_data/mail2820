Coordinates: 400000N 1161936E / 40N 116.32667E / 40; 116.32667 Tsinghua University (Chinese: , qinghua daxue), is a university in Beijing, China. The school is one of the nine universities of the C9 League. It was established in 1911 under the name "Tsinghua Xuetang" or "Tsinghua College" and was renamed the "Tsinghua School" one year later. The university section was founded in 1925 and the name "National Tsinghua University" was adopted in 1928. With a motto of Self-Discipline and Social Commitment, Tsinghua University describes itself as being dedicated to academic excellence, the well-being of Chinese society and to global development.[1] Tsinghua is almost always ranked as the first or second best university in mainland China in many national and international rankings.[2][3][4] According to the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 20112012, Tsinghua ranked 71 worldwide among universities. Since American Secretary of State John Hay suggested that the US $30 million plus Boxer indemnity paid to the United States was excessive, in 1909, President Roosevelt then obtained congressional approval to reduce the Qing Dynasty indemnity payment by US$10.8 million, on the condition that the said fund was to be used as scholarship for Chinese students to study in the United States. Using this fund, the Tsinghua College Chinese: (Qnghu Xutng) was established in Beijing, China, on 29 April 1911 on the site of a former royal garden belonging to a prince.[5] It was first a preparatory school for students later sent by the government to study in the United States. The faculty members for sciences were recruited by the YMCA from the United States and its graduates transferred directly to American schools as juniors upon graduation. In 1925, the school established its College Department and started its research institute on Chinese Study. In 1928, the authority officially changed its name to National Tsing Hua University (NTHU). During the Second World War in 1937, Tsinghua University along with Peking University and Nankai University, merged to form Changsha Temporary University in Changsha, and later National Southwestern Associated University in Kunming of Yunnan province. After the war, Tsinghua moved back to Beijing and resumed its operation. After the communist revolution at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, which led to the creation of the People's Republic of China (PRC), Tsinghua University's then President Mei Yi-Qi, followed by many[quantify] professors, fled to Taiwan where they established the National Tsing Hua Institute of Nuclear Technology in 1955, which later became National Tsing Hua University of Taiwan. In 1952, the Chinese government regrouped the country's higher education institutions in an attempt to build a Soviet style system, with individual institutions tending to specialise in a certain field of study. When the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, many university students walked out of the classrooms, and some went on to be part of the Red Guards, resulting in the complete shut down of the university. Only until 1978 when the Cultural Revolution ended, the university began to take in students again.[6] Even so, Tsinghua University remained in the top tier schools in China. In many years following this regroup, the school was commonly referred to as the "MIT of China."[7][8][9] But since the 1980s, the university began to incorporate a multidisciplinary system. As a result, several schools were re-incorporated. These included the School of Sciences, School of Business and Management, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Tsinghua Law School, School of Public Policy and Management, and the Academy of Arts and Design. Most national and international university rankings place Tsinghua amongst the best universities in mainland China.[2][3][4] Admission to Tsinghua is extremely competitive. Every year, many applicants scoring the highest in the National College Entrance Exams choose Tsinghua. According to a report in 2008, 215 out of 300 students who scored the top 10 in the 30 tested provinces and regions chose Tsinghua and 21 out of the 30 top scorers in each province and region chose the university.[10] A majority of selected students are among the brightest high school graduates in the country. Admissions to its graduate schools are also daunting by any measure; for instance, only about 16% of MBA applicants are admitted each year.[11] A recent study shows that Tsinghua University is the undergraduate alma mater that produces the most PhDs in U.S. universities.[12] Tsinghua alumni include the current CPC General secretary, Chinese president Hu Jintao, who graduated with a degree in hydraulic engineering in 1964, and the current Chinese vice president, Xi Jinping, who graduated with a degree in chemical engineering in 1979. Tsinghua has a reputation for hosting some of the most distinguished guest speakers of any university in the world, with international leaders such as Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Henry Kissinger, Carlos Ghosn, and Henry Paulson, all recently giving lectures to the university community.[13] As of 2003, Tsinghua University had 12 colleges and 48 departments, 41 research institutes, 35 research centers, and 167 laboratories, including 15 national key laboratories. In September 2006, Peking Union Medical College was renamed to Peking Union Medical College, Tsinghua University, although the Peking Union Medical College and Tsinghua University remain two separate institutions.[14] The university offers 51 bachelor's degree programs, 139 master's degree programs and 107 PhD programs. Recently, Tsinghua has become the first Chinese university to offer a Master of Laws program in American law, through a cooperative venture with the Temple University Beasley School of Law. The university is a member of LAOTSE, an international network of leading universities in Europe and Asia. Each year, the University celebrates the Intellectual Property Summer Institute in cooperation with Franklin Pierce Law Center of Concord, New Hampshire. It has its own editorial, Tsinghua University Press. Tsinghua Department of Mathematical Sciences (Tsinghua DMS) was established in 1927. As one of the premier Departments of Mathematical Sciences in China, Tsinghua DMS is famous for its rigorous academic attitude. Many famous Chinese mathematicians such like Shiing-Shen Chern and Luogeng Hua became well-known to the world from it. In 1952, Tsinghua DMS was merged with the Peking University Department of Mathematical Sciences. Then in 1979 it was renamed the "Tsinghua University Department of Applied Mathematics", and renamed again in 1999 to its current title. Tsinghua DMS has three institutes at present, the institute of Elementary Mathematics which has 27 faculties, the Institute of Applied Mathematics and Probability and Statistics which has 27 faculties, and the Institute of Computational Mathematics and Operations Reacher which has 20 faculties. There are currently about 400 undergraduate students and 200 graduate students. The Tsinghua School of Economics and Management (SEM) is consistently ranked one of the best among business schools in China.[17] It was the first mainland Chinese institution outside of Hong Kong to have achieved AACSB and EQUIS accreditations for its business and accounting programs. Founded in 1984, SEM was the first economics and management school in China. Its Founding Dean, Professor Zhu Rongji, later became the fifth Premier of the Peoples Republic of China. It is the successor to Tsinghua University's Department of Economics, which was established in 1926. SEM's International MBA program is one of the most prestigious programs in the People's Republic of China. The entirely English program is offered in collaboration with the MIT Sloan School of Management. The school provides more than 100 MBA courses per year. Upon finishing their required courses, students can select from curricula of different tracks (enterprise management, finance and banking, enterprise innovation and management, accounting analysis and management control, e-commerce, international business administration, etc.). After two years of business and leadership education, students obtain a Masters of Business Administration (MBA) degree from Tsinghua University as well as both a certificate from the MIT Sloan School of Management and MIT Sloan affiliate alumni status. Besides the M.I.T.-Tsinghua International MBA program, international students with Chinese-language skills can also choose to apply to the full-time MBA and the part-time MBA.[18] SEM also offers an EMBA program in partnership with INSEAD. The Tsinghua-INSEAD Dual Degree Executive MBA program was initiated in 2006, and is the first program of its kind in China combining international business education with a focus on Asia. The programs first class was opened in the summer of 2007. The program is taught jointly by the two schools faculties and focuses on developing the participants leadership skills, building their global mindsets, and honing their managerial talents. Upon successful completion of the program, participants are awarded two degrees: an EMBA degree by Tsinghua University and an MBA for Executives degree by INSEAD. Graduates become alumni of the two schools.[19] There are 8 majors in SEM, namely: management science and engineering, finance, economics, accounting, corporation strategy and policy, marketing, human resources management, and technology economics and management. The school also operates a number of prominent research centers, including: the Research Center for Contemporary Management, the Research Center for Technological Innovation, the National Entrepreneurship Research Center, the China Center for Financial Research, the National Center for Economic Research, the China Retail Research Center, the China Business Research Center, the Center for China in the World Economy, the Research Center for Contemporary Management and Technological Innovation, and the China Insurance and Risk Management Research Center. Today both SEM's professional and academic programs are considered one of the premier training grounds for China's business leaders.[20] The Tsinghua School of Journalism and Communication (TSJC) was established in April 2002. Its predecessor was Communication Studies in the Department of Chinese Language and Literature and its establishment of coincides with the development of media increasingly influencing world affairs in a time of fast-growing globalization. The school's research fields include International Communication, Film and Television Studies, New Media Studies, Media Operation and Management, and Business Journalism and are based on comprehensive academic research in journalism and communication theories. The objective of the school is to bring full advantage of Tsinghua University's comprehensive academic structure to Chinese and international media, to construct a first-rate discipline in journalism and communication studies, to cultivate talented professionals in the field and to explore advanced concepts in journalism and communication. The school also offers a two-year graduate program in international business journalism, sponsored by Bloomberg L.P. and the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ), that trains talented students and media professionals from around the globe in financial media and corporate communication.[21] The school has five research-oriented centers to organize and conduct academic research activities. They are: Center for International Communications Studies, Center for New Media Studies, Center for Film and Television Studies, Center for Media Management Studies and Center for Cultural Industry Studies.[21] The first and present dean of the school is Fan Jingyi, a notable chief editor of People's Daily during the period of 1990s. The Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, was jointly founded by Tsinghua University and the Shenzhen Municipal Government. The school is directly affiliated with Tsinghua University in Beijing. The campus is located in the University Town of Shenzhen since October 18, 2003.[22] Tsinghua University is frequently ranked amongst the best universities in China. It was ranked the 1st in mainland China by Chinese University Ranking Chinese university ranking and ranked 1st in mainland China by Netbig in 2010, 2009, 2008.[23] It was ranked 2nd in mainland China by China's Education Center in 2010, 2009 and 2008,[2] and was ranked 2nd in mainland China by webometrics 2008.[24] Tsinghua was ranked the 47th worldwide by QS World University Rankings in 2011,[25] 58th worldwide by Times Higher Education World University Rankings in 2010,[26] 36th worldwide in Human Resources & Labor Review's Best World Universities 2010,[27] 49th worldwide by US News and World Report (USNEWS),[28] 13th worldwide in the category of engineering and IT by USNEWS, 2009,[29] and ranked 151200 Worldwide in the Academic Ranking of World Universities by Shanghai Jiao Tong University 2010.[30] In 2011, according to University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP),[31] it is the 1st university in engineering field based ranking in the world. The campus of Tsinghua University is located in northwest Beijing, in the Haidian district which was designated for universities and other academic institutes. It is located on the former site of Qing Dynasty royal gardens and retains Chinese-style landscaping as well as traditional buildings, but many of its buildings are also in the Western-style, reflecting the American influence in its history. Along with its rival and neighbor the Peking University, it is known throughout China and the wider world for having one of the most beautiful campuses. Tsinghua University's campus was named one of the most beautiful college campuses in the world by Forbes in 2010;[32] it was the only university in Asia on the list.[33][34] T. Chuang, a 1914 graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, helped design the campus grounds of the Tsinghua University with influences of American architectural style and architectures.[35] The University's Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology is on a separate campus in a northern suburb of Beijing. Tsinghua University has produced many notable graduates, especially in political sphere. These include current General secretary, president Hu Jintao, current vice president Xi Jinping, current chairman of the National People's Congress Wu Bangguo, former premier Zhu Rongji, former first vice premier Huang Ju. Tsinghua also has two Nobel Prize winners, Tsung-Dao Lee and Yang Chen Ning. The latter is currently residing on Tsinghua campus. This is a list of people associated with Tsinghua University in China. The term Qinghua clique refers to a group of Communist Chinese politicians that have graduated from Tsinghua University. They are members of the fourth generation of Chinese leadership, and are purported to hold reformist and hesitantly pro-democratic ideas (a number have studied in the United States following graduation from Tsinghua, and some are said to be influenced by the reform ideals of Hu Yaobang). In the PRC, their ascendance to power began in 2008 at the 17th National Congress of the CPC.[36] Tsinghua graduates who have political prominence are disproportionately greater in number than graduates of other famous universities. Among the nine standing committees at the Politburo, there are four Tsinghua graduates; among the 24 Politburo committee members, there are five; and of all the "leaders of the party and the country", there are 10. The Tsinghua clique also referred to a group of Nationalist Chinese politicians who held high power in the Republic of China government and fled to Taiwan with the government during the Chinese Civil War. All of them are deceased. Tsinghua University has signed agreements with the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), the renowned international accountancy body that offers the Chartered Certified Accountant qualification worldwide, to train professional accountants in China. Under the agreement, Tsinghua will develop the programme that under ACCA's syllabus for enabling China's accounting students to join the ACCA professional exam scheme at a higher level. Tsinghua will also recognise the Oxford Brookes University BSc Applied Accounting degree, which has been successfully developed in conjunction with ACCA and which enables students who have completed two parts of the ACCA qualification to apply for the Oxford Brookes degree.[37] Sun Yat-sen University South China University of Technology
