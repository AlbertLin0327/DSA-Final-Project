Mingus Moves is a 1973 (see 1973 in music) album by jazz composer and bassist Charles Mingus. Mingus Moves (Atlantic SD 1653) is one of the late works of jazz bassist, composer, and bandleader Charles Mingus. He hired three new musicians for the recording: Don Pullen, piano; Ronald Hampton, trumpet; and George Adams, tenor saxophone. In an auspicious development, Mingus's ex-drummer Dannie Richmond, who had gained fame with his many years behind the bassist, rejoined the band on the first day of recording. The album, although not generally regarded as one of Mingus's greatest, does feature three remarkable compositions: "Canon," " Opus 3," and "Opus 4." "Canon" is a theme, as the title suggests, that can be superimposed upon itself. The song has a spiritual character, a la Coltrane, and is played with a warm sound by Pullen and Adams. This tune was also released on Hal Willner's tribute CD: Weird Nightmare - Meditations on Mingus. "Opus 3" is based on the Mingus's 1957 composition "Pithecanthropus Erectus," in which certain sections are played without key or meter restrictions. "Opus 4" is a straight-ahead swinger that features Don Pullen playing a free solo part. The other tunes include "Moves," a composition written and sung (along with Honi Gordon) by Doug Hammond, Richmond's predecessor; "Wee," the bop standard, arranged by Sy Johnson, who also worked with Mingus on Let My Children Hear Music (1971) and Mingus and Friends in Concert (1972); "Flowers," written by Adams; and "Newcomer" by Pullen, dedicated to his newborn daughter. The CD released in 1993 contains the bonus tracks "Big Alice" and "The Call," which were recorded during the same sessions. (All compositions by Mingus except where noted.)
