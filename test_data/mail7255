Galactic Pinball, known in Japanese as Galactic Pinball (, Gyarakutikku Pinbru?), is a video game for the Virtual Boy; as the name suggests it's a space themed pinball game. The game was released on July 21st, 1995 in Japan and on August 14th, 1995 in the United States. Galactic Pinball is best known for its tagline that comes at the end of the into: "Welcome to the space world. Let's go!", as well as a hidden Metroid themed bonus stage.The game is considered as one of the few reasons to own a Virtual Boy,as well one of the best games for the system.[1] Galactic Pinball has a very thin plot that is referred to in the games introduction. In the year 2100, somewhere in Milky Way galaxy a new world has been discovered called the space world. It is the mission of the player to explore this new world. Each pinball table in the game is representative of a different part of the players mission, and use board elements to represent things that are encountered while exploring the space world.[2] Galactic Pinball is based on the rules of pinball and players user flippers to control a ball and keep it in-bounds. It's a relatively simple pinball game, containing only five tables on which players play for a high score. Each table simulates a real pinball table, and has its own space related name and theme, as well as distinguishing elements and targets that score points when hit. A distinguishing features of the Colony board is a mini-game where the user shoots down various meteors from a three dimensional perspective. In UFO, the board initially starts with a large UFO at the top of the board, which flies away to reveal triggers that open two holes. Knocking the ball into these holes accesses such bonuses as center posts and kickbacks. If the player gets the jackpot after 100,000,000 points, the game will lock-up with the music still playing. In Alien, after getting the ball into the Alien's Lair, an alien will appear to be hit to gain points. Cosmic is a classic pinball board that has a third flipper and a ramp that accesses a special area with several bumpers. It also has a rotating sphere that the player can enter for bonus points. Samus Aran, protagonist of Nintendo's Metroid series, makes a cameo.
