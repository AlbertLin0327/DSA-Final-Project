Lorimer Park is a 230-acre (0.93km2) public park in Abington Township, Pennsylvania. The park, a bequest from the late George Horace Lorimer (long-time editor-in-chief of The Saturday Evening Post), is connected to Pennypack Park in Philadelphia County, and the Pennypack Creek runs through both parks. The park borders Fox Chase Farm, the only remaining active farm in Philadelphia County.  Coordinates: 400545N 750423W / 40.0957N 75.0730W / 40.0957; -75.0730 [1]
