Berub Reynolds undertook all of the iron work. Philip Sassoon thought highly enough of Tilden to recommend him to Churchill to work on his country house Chartwell in Kent. The garden planting was designed by Norah Lindsay, who recreated the feel of Italy by setting herbaceous plants against the dark background created by the terraced hedges. Norah also advised Philip on his Trent Park garden, which was thirteen miles from the centre of London in New Barnet. Coordinates: 510432N 05958E / 51.07565N 0.99958E / 51.07565; 0.99958
