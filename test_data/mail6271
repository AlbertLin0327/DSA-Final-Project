Veerakoodi Vellalar is one of the sub-castes of Vellalar community residing in Thanjavur and Pudukkottai districts which was termed as Musukunda Nadu in Early Chola period. They are also known as Musukundha Vellalars, named after the legendary early Chola king Musukundan. Veerakoodi have spread beyond India to create communities in Singapore, London and many other countries while maintaining strong social and cultural ties with their villages in South India. A 2007 study revealed that Iyers and Iyengars formed a separate cluster along with the high-ranking non-Brahmin communities of Tamil Nadu such as the Veerakodi Vellalars.[1] People from this caste inhabit the villages of Thittakudi, Alathur, Mathukkur, Soorangadu, Alampalam, Moothakuruchi, Sembalur, Pattikkadu, Silambavelankadu, Soorapallam,[2] Karuppur, Seventhanpatti, Sedangadu, Pulavanchi, Andami, Aladikkumulai, Paalamuthi, Sundampatti, Eanathi, Vikramam, Keelakuruchi, Thamarankottai, Nattuchalai[3], Sengapaduthankadu(sengai), Kasankadu,vendakkottai, Mattankal, Pudukkotai Ullur, Keerathur, Athikkottai, Nemmeli, Pallathur, Mannangadu, Vattukudi, Kattayankadu, Sirankudi Baiyananapalli[krishnagiri] and Keelathaniyam.
