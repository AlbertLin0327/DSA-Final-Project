"Real me" is a song from Ayumi Hamasaki's 2002 full-length studio album RAINBOW. RAINBOW marked the beginning of Ayumi Hamasaki's incorporation of English into the lyrics of her album-released songs (with the exception of her songs under Nippon Columbia, during her Nothing from Nothing days. Also, the B-side of her single "Love: Destiny", "Love: Since 1999" used English. However, the lyrics for "Love: Since 1999" were composed by Tsunku.) The video clip for Ayumi's "Real me" displays Ayumi in a futuristic "Dancing Cyborg Factory" where dance robots are manufactured. It also features Chiharu and Etsu, two popular Japanese celebrities.
