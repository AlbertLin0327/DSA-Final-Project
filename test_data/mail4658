James or John Yonge (fl. 1423), was an English translator. Yonge belonged to an English family settled in the Irish pale. William Yonge, archdeacon of Meath from 1407 to 1437, was possibly his brother. Both James and John Yonge occur in the Irish patent and close rolls early in the fifteenth century. James Yonge was in prison in Trim Castle from January to October 1423, being removed in the latter month to Dublin Castle, and being pardoned on 10 May 1425. A John Yonge was serjeant of the county of Limerick in the reign of Richard II, held a lease of various lands, and was convicted of unspecified felonies. The translator was servant to James Butler, 4th earl of Ormonde, at whose request, about 1423, he translated into English the Secreta Secretorum attributed to Aristotle. It was a book in much request in the Middle Ages, and translations were made in the early fifteenth century by Hoccleve, John Shirley (1366?1456), Lydgate, and Burgh, and Gower used it in his Confessio Amantis. Yonge's translation appears to have been made from a French version by one Gofroi of Waterford; it was dedicated to Ormonde and is perhaps the only lengthy work known written in the English of the Pale early in the fifteenth century (Steele). It is divided into seventy-two chapters and is interspersed with passages from Irish history, including some of Ormonde's exploits in 1422. Several manuscripts of it are extant.
