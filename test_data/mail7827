Szydowiec [dwvjts]( listen) (Latin: Shidloviecz, Russian: , Hebrew: , Yiddish: ) is a town in Szydowiec County, Mazovian Voivodeship, Poland, with 15,243 inhabitants (December 31, 2005). It is the seat of Szydowiec Commune (Gmina Szydowiec). Previously, from 1975 to 1998, it was in the Radom Voivodeship. Szydowiec historically belongs to Lesser Poland, from its beginnings until 1795, it was part of Lesser Poland's Sandomierz Voivodeship. From the 12th century the environs of Szydowiec belonged to the powerful knightly family of Odrow, who descended from Moravian-Bohemian Baworowic family. In the 13th century the site of the present castle was occupied by a stronghold on an artificial island with wood and earth defences and by a village called Szydowiec. The present town came into being in the early 15th century and together with the neighbourigh estate was the property of the Szydowiecki and Radziwi families until the 19th century. The town flourished in the 16th and the first half of 17th centuries. It was then an important centre of trade and crafts, mainry stone-masonry based on the exploatition of the local sandstone which was easy to work. This stone was used to carve architectural sculptural elements and to make tools for agriculture. It was also a building material for the local Saint Sigsmunt Church, Castle in Szydowiec and the Town hall in Szydowiec; moreover, it was sent to Kielce, Cracow and Warsaw. Among the goods traded in vere agricurtular products. The period of wars 1648-1717 and numerous epidemics and fires brought abought a decline of Szydowiec,which persisted for centuries, its state being yet aggravated after the partitions of Poland. The town owes this present cheracter to transformations in urban design and architecture which took place in the second half of the 19th century and in the 20th century. Szydowiec also had a strong Jewish community until World War II. At one point it had a population that was of a Jewish majority. It was home to Grand Rabbi Nathan David Rabinowitz (d. 1865), the grandson of Grand Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchak of Peshischa, and the father of the Biala Hasidic dynasty.
