The rock cod (Lotella rhacina) is a temperate fish found off the coasts of southeastern Australia, Tasmania, the Great Australian Bight and northwards up the south western Australia coasts. They are also found around the coasts of New Zealand. They belong to the family Moridae and are not related to the true cods (genus Gadus). They are also known as beardie in Australia. Rock cod are yellow-grey to red-brown with white fin margins. They have chin barbels. They may grow up to 50cm in length. They are found in caves in bays and coastal reefs. They are frequently found inshore and inhabit shallow waters in the continental shelf with typical depth of 10 to 90 metres. Note that there are many other fish that are sometimes referred to as rock cod, but most of these are unrelated to the cod family, and are better known as groupers.
