The ceramic pipestem triangle is a lab tool often used with a Bunsen burner when heating a crucible. It is a triangle made of clay that sits above the burner to suspend the object that is being "roasted" at the desired height. This is also known as a pipeclay triangle. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
