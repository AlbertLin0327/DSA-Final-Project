The King's College (also TKC or simply King's) is a Christian liberal arts college located in Midtown Manhattan. Percy Crawford founded The Kings College in 1938 in Belmar, New Jersey.[4] The school re-located in 1941 to New Castle, Delaware[5], and again in 1955 to the former Briarcliff Lodge site in Briarcliff Manor, New York.[6] At Briarcliff, The King's College sponsored the The King's Tournament, a sports tournament in which East Coast Christian college athletes competed each year.[7] In 1962, after Crawford's death in 1960[5], Dr. Robert A. Cook became the college's second president.[8] The college prospered under his leadership, with enrollment growing to a high of 870 students in 1980.[9] After 23 years as president, Cook retired and became the college's chancellor in 1985, a position which he held until his death in 1991.[8] Friedhelm Radandt succeeded Cook to become the college's third president.[citation needed] Nine years later, in December 1994, the college shut down, as a result of years of declining enrollment, bad financial decisions, and the deterioration of the Briarcliff campus.[9] The college declared bankruptcy, owing more than $25 million to its creditors.[10] The college charter, first granted by the New York Board of Regents in 1955, remained in force.[11] In 1997, the College's charter was amended to make Campus Crusade for Christ the sole member of the corporation.[11] Together with Campus Crusade founder Bill Bright, J. Stanley "Stan" Oakes, then the director of Faculty Commons[12], a Campus Crusade ministry, began work to pay off the institution's debts and re-establish it in New York City, along with the recently acquired Northeastern Bible College, which had experienced a similar decline and closure as King's.[13] In 1999 King's leased 45,000 square feet (4,200m2) of space on three floors of the Empire State Building in New York City for classrooms, a student recreation center, and administrative offices.[6] Radandt remained president, with Oakes as Chairman.[11] In January 2003, Oakes became the fourth president; five years later, Oakes became chancellor and Andy Mills became the fifth president. Following treatment for brain cancer, Oakes reassumed the presidency on January 1, 2009. In December 2009, the College announced that Oakes would take a year-long sabbatical. On August 23, 2010, the college announced the appointment of conservative writer Dinesh D'Souza as its new president.[1] The college, a subsidiary of Campus Crusade for Christ,[11] claims the Protestant evangelical tradition as its own.[14] It "seeks ambitious students who want to make a difference in the world," and who "seek a rigorous undergraduate education that is rooted in the Christian liberal arts tradition" in order to educate them for "principled leadership."[15][16] "Through its commitment to the truths of Christianity and a biblical worldview," the TKC mission statement reads, "The Kings College seeks to transform society by preparing students for careers in which they help to shape and eventually to lead strategic public and private institutions, and by supporting faculty members as they directly engage culture through writing and speaking publicly on critical issues."[17] The college is authorized by the Board of Regents to grant two degrees in a total of four programs.[18] and has received regional accreditation from the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools' Commission on Higher Education.[19][20] The college currently maintains degrees in "Business Management," "Politics, Philosophy, and Economics" ("PPE"), and[21] a major in "Media, Culture and the Arts" ("MCA"), which was officially launched in August 2009.[22] Within the PPE program, students are able to pursue "concentrations" in literature, media, theology, and foundations of education.[23] The MCA program has concentrated electives in literature, creative writing, journalism, media studies, and the visual and theatre arts.[24] Students also take courses in theology and Western civilization.[25] The King's College has been accredited by the New York Board of Regents for over 40 years.[26] The King's College pursued regional accreditation with the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and after completing a self-study and being reviewed by the Commission on Higher Education in 2009, The King's College was granted regional accreditation as of November 19, 2009.[27] King's is now fully accredited and no longer needs to pursue accreditation with the New York Board of Regents. The King's College will complete its next self-study with Middle States for accreditation renewal between 2014 and 2015. [4] During the 2007-2008 academic year, the school enrolled a total of 220 students from 11 countries and 37 states.[6] By the fall term of 2008, enrollment had grown to 258,[28] and the average ACT score of the 2008 incoming class was 28, putting the King's College in the 90th percentile nationwide.[29] Kings does not require attendance at church or chapel services, and students are not required to sign a statement of faith (although faculty are).[30] Instead, students sign an honor code pledging not to lie, cheat, steal, or turn a blind eye to those who do.[31] This is described by the school as the minimum standard of ethical behavior that all students have contracted to live by.[31] Students live in groups of three or four[32] in apartments in two high-rise buildings on Sixth Avenue near the school's facilities in the Empire State Building.[6] During the summer, King's leases these apartments to students in the city for summer internships.[33] King's has a house system, although the school describes the system as also having similarities to traditional fraternities and sororities.[34] All incoming students are assigned to one of the ten currently established houses, which are named for historic leaders: C.S. Lewis, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Corrie Ten Boom, Elizabeth I, Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, Winston Churchill, and Clara Barton.[34] Students are encouraged to develop strong ties within their houses.[34] During the year, they participate in inter-house competition in events such as "The Great Race," a scavenger hunt throughout the City,[35] and the house GPA contest, where each house attempts to achieve the highest average GPA.[6][36] As upperclassmen, students are eligible for election by their peers to one of four house leadership positions: President, Scholar, Helmsman, and Chamberlain.[34] Each position has certain spiritual, academic, or residence life responsibilities within the house.[34] Kings has many student groups, including The King's Debate Society, which competes against other university teams in British Parliamentary Style debate; Mock Trial, which puts students in the shoes of courtroom lawyers and witnesses, competing against other colleges at a regional and national level. The King's College is one of the only Christian colleges in the United States that offers Mock Trial. The Tent is a Christian group that meets to worship God and edify one another through prayer and music. Other clubs include The King's College Theatre (TKCT), which puts on dramatic performances and other theater-related events, The King's Dancers, which schedules dance practices, performances, and outings. Other organizations include The King's Council, the Kings student government group, the Empire State Tribune, the Kings student newspaper, and The Lewis Review, a strictly unaffiliated student publication run by the House of Lewis[37]. King's students are encouraged to start groups they see a need for at the college.[38] The King's College has a number of athletic teams, competing at various levels. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country and soccer. Women's sports include basketball, volleyball, cross country and soccer. Beginning in the 20122013 school year, TKC will be a member of the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA). Continuing TKC's policy of encouraging students to start their own programs and take active ownership in student life, most teams at King's are student-started and run ventures. Athletic teams at The King's College have been started since the college was re-chartered in 1999, meaning they are not directly affiliated with and do not receive support from TKC's athletics programs that were centered at Briarcliff Manor. The athletics program at The King's College is designed to serve students' interests in sports and recreational activities, whether they are competitive, recreational, or instructional. Emphasis is placed on student leadership and involvement, as well as on the dedication and commitment of club members.[39]
