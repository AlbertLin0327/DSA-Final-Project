The 1995 Coca-Cola Cup Final was played between Liverpool and Bolton Wanderers at Wembley Stadium on 2 April 1995. Liverpool won the match 21. Two Steve McManaman goals in the 37th and 68th minutes put Liverpool ahead, but Alan Thompson scored a brilliant goal for Bolton to give them some hope going into the last 20 minutes of the game. However, Liverpool managed to keep Bolton at bay for the rest of the game, to claim their fifth League Cup Final victory. Steve McManaman was awarded man of the match and this match was dubbed by Liverpool fans as "The McManaman Final" due to the nature of his performance, earning plaudits from special guest, Sir Stanley Matthews.[1] This is one of the first live Wembley finals to feature helicopters to provide birds-eye view shots for its TV coverage.
