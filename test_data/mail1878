Content:
El Mani Pavilion is a pavilion being built in El Mani, Mayagez, Puerto Rico.[2] At the site there was a covered basketball court; this was demolished to make way for the new building. It cost $3,500,000 to build.[3] It was originally going to host the boxing events at the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games but now it will hold the handball events.[4] Coordinates: 181449.26N 671027.01W / 18.2470167N 67.1741694W / 18.2470167; -67.1741694
