The American Software Testing Qualifications Board (ASTQB) was founded in 2003 as the American Testing Board. In April 2005, the name was changed to the American Software Testing Qualifications Board. ASTQB is a non-profit organization whose members comprise a group of highly experienced experts in software testing who volunteer their time to the development, maintenance, and promotion of the ISTQB Certified Tester program in the U.S. They also represent U.S. interests internationally as the national board for the U.S. within the International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB). The ISTQB is responsible for the international qualification scheme called "ISTQB Certified Tester". ISTQB certificates at Foundation Level are also dual certified by ISEB, which was established in 1967 and is the world's leading issuer of Software Testing certifications and the only certifications aligned with the worldwide Professionalism in IT campaign. ASTQB's exam and accreditation fees are charged to cover the cost connected with the administration of exams, applications for accreditation, the maintenance of a physical office, exhibits at leading software testing conventions, and the employment of administrative staff.
