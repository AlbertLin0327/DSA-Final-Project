Farang (Thai:  [far]) is a generic Thai word for someone of European ancestry, no matter where they may come from. Edmund Roberts, US envoy in 1833, defined the term as "Frank (or European)[1]." People of African ancestry from western countries are occasionally called in Thai:  farang dam ('black farang') to distinguish them from Africans. This began during the Vietnam War, when the United States military maintained bases in Thailand. During the Vietnam War, American military presence increased in Thailand.[2] This experience provided a unique impression of Americans/Westerners for many Thai people. However, the hostility that is often expressed through the use of farang goes beyond military presence.[3] Western religions, lifestyles, eating habits, family dynamics, ideas about respect and independence, clothing styles, language, and even appearance, may directly clash with those of the Thai people.[2] Globalization and other factors have brought about a strange relationship between Thais and foreigners. As Anna Tsing explains in "The Global Situation", globalization's world-making flows have acted much like water rushing down a hillside, carving rocks, moving gravel, switching courses, and constantly recreating channels.[4] Globalization's flow through Thailand has affected the country both in positive and negative ways. Some stones were upturned and broken down by the water's force and others were strengthened and fortified by that same force. The word farang teeters on the boundary between positive and negative in Thailand.[5] The ebbs and flows of Globalization continue with tourism. Tourism in Thailand is a large industry, both sex and otherwise. As Ara Wilson discusses in her book The Intimate Economies of Bangkok, this industry is intertwined with and affected by Gender Identities in Thailand.[2] Tourism, in combination with a history of impoverishment, has led some Thai people to associate westerners with money. Tourism is the major foreign exchange earner, with over 11 million tourist arrivals in 2004.[5][2] This association with money and power can lead to a rock star treatment of foreigners; many privileges and a great deal of respect often come to those with white skin. Awe and admiration for foreigners is commonplace.[6] The word suey ('beautiful') often follows the word farang. The idea that white is beautiful is reinforced by store shelves full of skin-whitening products. Thai people also, historically and today, are interested in keeping Thailand for the Thais.[2] This idea has spread into the cultural identity of the farang, both with fees often four times as large at parks and temples, and by restricting visas for spouses of Thai people. All of this is interconnected to the fact that Thais pay close attention to farang in their home country.[5] Farang is also the Thai word for the guava fruit, introduced by Portuguese traders over 400 years ago, which of course can lead to jokes when foreigners are seen eating a guava in Thailand. Farang khi nok (Thai: ) is a particular variety of guava, feijoa. Scruffy Westerners, especially backpackers, may also be called Farang khi nok. This is usually taken to mean "bird-shit farang", as khi means waste and nok means (wild) bird; but, while khi nok may mean guano, it is also a species of fish, Diagramma pictum, a species of grunts Haemulidae.[7] Varieties of food/produce which were introduced by Europeans are often called farang varieties. Hence, potatoes are man farang (Thai: ), whereas man (Thai: ) alone can be any tuber; culantro is called phak chi farang (Thai: , literally farang cilantro/coriander); and chewing gum is mak farang (Thai: ). Mak (Thai: ) is Thai for betel, which many rural Thais chew for the euphoria it gives. In the Isan Lao dialect, the guava is called mak sida (Thai: ), mak being a prefix for fruit names. Thus Bak sida (Thai: ), bak being a prefix when calling males, refer jokingly to a Westerner, by analogy to the Thai language were farang can mean both guava and Westerner.[8] It is generally believed that the word farang originated with the Indo-Persian word farangi, meaning foreigner. This in turn comes from the word Frank via the Arabic word firinjyah, which was used to refer to the Franks, a West Germanic tribe that became the biggest political power in Western Europe during the early Middle Ages and from which France derives its name. Due to the fact that the Frankish Empire ruled Western Europe for centuries, the word "Frank" became deeply associated, by the Eastern Europeans and Middle Easterners, with Latins who professed the Roman Catholic faith. By another account the word comes through Arabic afranj, and there are quite a few articles about this. One of the most detailed treatments of the subject is by Rashid al-din Fazl Allh.[9] In either case the original word was pronounced firangi in North India and Pakistan or parangiar in Tamil, and entered Khmer as barang and Malay as ferenggi.
