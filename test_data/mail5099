 Appearances (Goals). Mohamed Ibrahim (Arabic:  ) (born March 1, 1992) is an Egyptian footballer currently playing as an attacking midfielder with Egyptian Premier League club Zamalek.[1] He is known for his great technical abilities such as the Duqwon dribble or the khalkhalash, excellent free kick accuracy, and accurate short passes. Ibrahim is a product of Zamalek Youth Academy; he made his debut with the club's first team in a league game with the coach Hossam Hassan. Despite playing only 4 games in his debut season, Ibrahim was considered as one of the key player at the start of 2011.[2] He scored his first goal against Al-Masry, which was chosen as one of the most beautiful goal of the whole season, not only because of its beauty, but also because of the circumstances - it was a last minute goal-winner.[3] Mohamed is also member of Egypt U-20 team participating at 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup. After an opening game against Brazil, the opponents coach - Ney Franco - told to the press: "The Egyptians performance was outstanding. They were very organised and some players, like Mohamed Ibrahim and Mohamed Salah, are awaiting a bright future".[4] Mohamed Ibrahim was also touted as a "future star" by Polish media,[5] described as "pearl". He scored 3 goals in the group match against Austria.[6] That was a first hat-trick scored by an African player in the history of this tournament.[7]
