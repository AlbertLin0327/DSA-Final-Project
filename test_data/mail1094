Alexandre (Alex-Andre) Magno is a Brazilian born, Emmy Nominated choreographer and director. Alex has a wide vocabulary of dance styles, which includes Hip-hop, Jazz, Ballet, Samba, Flamenco, Tango, Salsa, and Martial Arts. Some of his credits include: Madonna, Yanni, Britney Spears, The infamous Lido La Tourn, Ballet Hispanico, The Ringling Brothers Circus, and the Academy Awards all the while continuing work with his own highly acclaimed dance company, Personna Dance Theatre". In 1993 Alex was hand picked by Madonna to be the choreographer of her world tour and HBO special The Girlie Show. She recognized not only his choreographic talent, but also his unique ability to mix sensuality and strength in a dynamic way that was still commercially viable. Since the show was going to be so theatrical, and rely so much on the staging and choreography, Madonna knew that she needed a choreographer who understood how to make a dramatic show that didnt rely on gimmicks or spectacles. Alex was the only choreographer that could fulfill her vision, and together they made The Girlie Show one of the most sensual and artistic tours to this day. Alexs work on The Girlie Show has been called "provocative, sensual, outstanding, and genius" (Daily Variety, November. 22, 1993). "Intricate dancing and expressions expertly choreographed by Alex Magno" - "Daily Variety, November. 22, 1993" In 2001, Madonna called on Alexs talent again for her Drowned World Tour,[1] this time with even greater demands: Tango, Salsa, Flamenco, Karate, Kung Fu, Samurai sword work, a Contortionist, and a traditional Javanese dancer! She knew that only Alex would be able to handle such a tall order with the integrity and passion that her vision deserved. Alex was recognized with both an Emmy and American Choreography Award Nomination. Immediately following Madonnas tour, Alex began working for the male pop group Plus One on their 2002 Obvious tour. Alex was able to break boundaries on this tour, moving away from the formatted boy band look, and bring not only individuality, but artistry and dynamics to the genre. In 2003, Britney Spears asked Alex to choreograph for her ABC special and MTV club tour, in which his work was called sensual, seductive, and mature by US Weekly. She personally brought Alex in to add a dynamic, artistic edge to her work. In 2004, Alex was commissioned by the European company ODE, to create the centerpiece of their 10th anniversary show, to be titled Illusionatics. Earlier in the same year, Mr. Magno was featured in a New York Times article about choreographers, and was dubbed the one to watch. In December 2005, Magno worked with famed Flamenco Guitarist Ron Benise, choreographing and staging Nights Of Fire a PBS special[2] which incorporates flamenco, afro-Cuban salsa, samba, and more. Immediately following the hit success of the PBS Special, Alex went on to work on Benises 2006 National Tour; re-mounting, choreographing in addition to sharing the stage with Benise as a one of the lead performer. Alex appeared, directing and choreographing The Eternal a short film written by Zalman King, for BRAVO T.V. that aired as part of Bravos Forty Duce series. He was also choreographed for the show So You Think You Can Dance, on Fox, as one of the shows first guest choreographers. Alex choreographed the video Sway for the Pussycat Dolls, which is from the soundtrack to Shall We Dance. In the beginning of 2006, Alex completed his work on Orfeu In The Carnival of Souls a full-length original ballet commissioned by New York's Ballet Hispanico. In addition to conceive and choreograph the Ballet, Mr. Magno directed, produced the entire Sound Track and also co-wrote, most of the original music made for the Ballet. The company will be touring the US and internationally with this piece in the coming season. Orfeu In The Carnival Of Souls received raving reviews from (The Villager - Sara G. Levin): The premier of Alexandre Magnos Orfeu in the Carnaval of Souls, a Brazilianized version of Orpheuss descent into the underworld by Ballet Hispanico, was splendidly seductive. In one duet the lovers are so entangled in swings and splits, they look like they could get lost weaving through each otherThe music, a wonderful collection of samba, waltz, and Spanish guitar, changes to match the creepy mood, setting an uneasy tone to contrast the willowy love scenes. Above all, Orfeus Broadway-style performance adds pizzazz to this classic story and delivers compelling, convincing characters. Magno had the privilege to collaborate with "Yanni" as "Artistic Director and Choreographer for Televisa and for Yanni's 2008 PBS TV Special "Yanni Voices" which feature 4 amazing new artists: Natahan Pacheco, Chloe, Ender Thomas and Leslie Mills, as well as a world class orchestra and 4 Latin Artists: Jos Jos, Lucero, Christian Castro and Olga Taon. This special was nominated for a Luna award in Mexico.

La Rueda a Latin/Cuban ballet, inspired on a collection of established and new Latin Artists; using popular and classic Latin songs such as Celia Cruzs life anthem La Vida Es Un Carnaval. In 1989, Alex formed his own dance company, Personna Dance Theater, to expand his choreographic vision, and prove that a dance company born in L.A., could hold its own on a worldwide stage. He wanted to show that Artistry and Commerciality could be combined in a in an exciting, provocative, and sensual way.

At this festival, in front of an international crowd of over 8,000 fans, Alex received a special homage award for artistic excellence in the realm of choreography. In 1996, Alex took on one of the most serious jobs of his career. He was hired to choreograph, write, and compose Hiroshima Requiem, a dance concert commemorating the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima. Alex was chosen to be the one to lead this project because of his integrity and dedication to artistic exploration of truth through dance. Then, after a two year break from the stage, in which Alex was improving his skills as a composer, writer, and editor, he returned. The world famous Parisian Lido Show called upon Alexs vast knowledge to direct, choreograph, and compose Rendezvous Liaison, an original ballet for their upcoming world tour. Most recently, Alex has completed work for the Ballet Hispanico in NYC. He created an original ballet based on the popular Hispanic music of the 40s and 50s.
