Bactiguard Wire Brass is a championship section Brass Band based in Warrington, Cheshire. The band was formed in September 2001 as Wire Brass and achieved Championship Section status within 5 years, in 2006, after coming second in the national 1st section championship.[1] The name was then changed to Bactiguard Wire Brass after a sponsorship deal.[2] Paul Andrews is the Musical Director of the band, and the band has recently appointed Adrian "Benny" Morris, bass trombone with the Halle Orchestra, as its associate conductor.
