WETV-LP is a low power television station serving the Murfreesboro, Tennessee area. It broadcasts its analog signal on VHF channel 11. Its transmitter is located at the intersection of Northwest Broad Street and South Church Street in Murfreesboro, sharing tower space with WGNS AM 1450. WETV is owned by The Rutherford Group Inc., which also operates WGNS. During times when syndicated programming is on the air, the station transmits data from its weather station with WGNS's program audio playing in the background. At times of local programming, one can see shots of the studio and respective hosts. When viewers tune to channel 11, they see the host and its guests in the studio, while the radio show is in progress. This technique was also used for the televised versions of Howard Stern and Don Imus' radio shows. The station is a Class-A operation, even though the calls still list it as a "-LP". Currently broadcasting in analog at 61 watts, WETV has been approved to "flash-cut" the channel 11 frequency to digital, with a power increase to 300 watts. WETV was previously the call letters for a PBS affiliate in Atlanta, Georgia, now known today as WPBA.
