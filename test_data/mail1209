Dominic Clifton Kane (born January 22, 1982), also known as Dom Kane, is a British progressive house and electro tech-house producer based in Cardiff, Wales. His discography includes tracks such as "Glitched Out",[1] "Sweet & Low" and "Room Of Doom", which appear on The World's Greatest Electro Club Mix [Resist], Discomaniacs III [Sick Watona], and Its Good For The Soul [ADHD Digital]. Already having become well established as an international DJ performing as a resident for the world renowned "We Love..." at Space Nightclub, Ibiza, and Ministry of Sound Club London, in 2007, he turned his hands to engineering and sound design, more notably in the form of sample library productions for Soundsnap in Greece, and Loopmasters based in Brighton. In 2009, he released a sample pack in the artist series of the Loopmasters brand,[2] which went on to become one of the best selling sample packs of that year[citation needed], winning an award from Computer Music Magazine.[citation needed]
