Cannon in Korea were first developed by Choe Mu-seon, for exclusive use by the Goryeo Army. Several types were made and saw successful action during the Mongol invasions of Japan. One of the most notable types was the "byuldae-wangu", a simple stone mortar that hurled explosive rounds at the enemy. Other firearms were used, but would be considered arquebuses, rather than cannons, because of their small size. Cannons of the Joseon era were relatively small in size, but boosted accuracy and range. They saw extensive use during the Japanese invasions of Korea, by both the Joseon Army and the Navy. They were very effective against the weaker Japanese ships. The Nanjung Ilgi says that many were captured and used by the Japanese when their full potential was realized. There existed multiple varieties, each for a different situation or purpose. Below is a list of types used by the Joseon military: A distinguishing Korean method of firing involved inserting paper and a wooden stump between the gunpowder and the projectile(s). Doing so increased accuracy, range, and firepower. Sand was also poured in when firing grapeshot. Projectiles were mainly iron shot, but some were made of stone. Others were filled with gunpowder and were, therefore, explosive. There was a wide usage of "daejon", a wooden arrow with iron tips and fins. They were more accurate, but lacked range and firepower. Sometimes the Joseon Navy used grapeshot and arrows for anti-personnel warfare, but that was not as widely used. In many cases the projectiles were used in conjunction.
