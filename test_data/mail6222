Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury and 3rd Earl of Elgin (1656  16 December 1741) was the son of Robert Bruce, 2nd Earl of Elgin and Lady Diana Grey. His maternal grandparents were Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford and Lady Anne Cecil, daughter of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter. His Memoirs, not published until long after his death, are a valuable source of information on English history in the last quarter of the seventeenth century. Lord Bruce, as he was styled from 1663 to 1685, was M.P. for Marlborough between 1679 and 1681 and M.P. for Wiltshire in 1685. He became a Gentleman of the Bedchamber in 1676. From 1685, when he inherited the earldom, to 1688, he was a Lord of the Bedchamber, Lord Lieutenant of Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire (the latter in the absence of the Earl of Sandwich) and was a Page of Honour, at the coronation of King James II on 23 April 1685. He was devoted to Charles II, who remarked on his deathbed " I see you love me dying as well as living"; Bruce wrote later of Charles' death "Thus ended my happy days at a Court, and to this hour I bewail my loss."[1] He also admired James II, though not blind to his faults as a ruler. He married, firstly, Lady Elizabeth Seymour,[2] daughter of Henry Seymour, Lord Beauchamp and Mary Capell and granddaughter of William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset, on 31 August 1676. She died in 1697 in premature childbirth, brought on by a false report that her husband had been executed. They had three children: He married, secondly, Charlotte d'Argenteau, comtesse d'Esneux,[2] in Brussels (St Jacques sur Coudenberg) on 27 April 1700. They had one daughter: He was one of only four peers who continued to support James II after the Prince of Orange embarked for England. On 18 December 1688 he accompanied King James to Rochester when he fled London. In May 1695, Lord Elgin was accused of having conspired to plan the restoration of King James II and in February 1696 he was imprisoned in the Tower of London,[3] but admitted to bail a year later and allowed to leave England for Brussels, where he died and was buried. Some historians have accused him of double-dealing in swearing allegiance to William III while plotting the restoration of James; others argue that his loyalty was to the monarchy, and that he supported whichever monarch seemed best fitted to rule at any given time[4]. William III clearly did not regard him as a dangerous character, as shown by the fact that he was left in peace once he left England. It seems that from about 1710 it was made clear that he could return safely to England, but that he was by then happily settled in Brussels.[5] Ailesbury seems to have been almost universally liked even by political opponents, having a reputation for honesty, decency and fair dealing. Charles II was clearly fond of him and confided in him to a rare degree; James II also liked him, and Louis XIV regarded him as almost the only English nobleman who was not motivated purely by self interest. Though he changed allegiance himself he had no patience with time-servers: he detested the Earl of Sunderland ( while admitting he was good company )[6] and in 1689 told his cousin the Earl of Danby that for treachery to James II he deserved to " be knocked on the head".[7] Ailesbury devoted many years to writing his Memoirs, which were not published until 1890. Historians have praised them particularly for the vivid portraits of the leading figures in English life, including James II, William III, Danby, Sunderland, the Duke of Lauderdale and the Marquis of Halifax. Most striking is his absolute devotion to Charles II " my good and gracious master, the best that ever reigned over us".
