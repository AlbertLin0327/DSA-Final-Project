Cervelle de canut is a cheese spread/dip, and a specialty of Lyon, France. The dish is a base of fromage blanc, seasoned with chopped herbs, shallots, salt, pepper, olive oil and vinegar. Its name literally means "silk worker's brain", after the canuts, the silk workers of 19th century Lyon. Its name is thought to reflect the low opinion the affluent in Lyon had of the weavers.[1] Recipes:
