Content:
The equivalent rectangular bandwidth or ERB is a measure used in psychoacoustics, which gives an approximation to the bandwidths of the filters in human hearing, using the unrealistic but convenient simplification of modeling the filters as rectangular band-pass filters. Researchers have derived a differential equation giving the ERB value v in Hz of a human auditory filter with a center frequency of f kHz.[1] Solving this equation gives roughly the following relation between the ERB value v and the frequency f in Hz: Or the converse: A newer approximation is:[2]
