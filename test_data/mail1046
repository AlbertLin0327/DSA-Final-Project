cobalt hydrocarbonyl tetracarbonylhydridocobalt, Tetracarbonylhydrocobalt -33C, 240K, -27F 47C, 320K, 117F Cobalt tetracarbonyl hydride is the organometallic compound with the formula HCo(CO)4. It is a yellow liquid that forms a colorless vapor and has an intolerable odor.[1] Its main use is as a catalyst in hydroformylation. HCo(CO)4 is a trigonal bipyrimidal molecule. The hydride ligand occupies one of the axial positions, thus the symmetry of the molecule is C3v.[2] The Co-CO and Co-H bond distances were determined by gas-phase electron diffraction to be 1.764 and 1.556 , respectively.[3]. The oxidation state of cobalt in this compound is -1. Like some other metal carbonyl hydrides, HCo(CO)4 is acidic, with a pKa of 8.5.[4] HCo(CO)4 melts at -33 C and above that temperature decomposes to Co2(CO)8 and H2.[1] It undergoes substitution by tertiary phosphines. For example, triphenylphosphine gives HCo(CO)3PPh3 and HCo(CO)2(PPh3)2. These derivatives are more stable than HCo(CO)4 and are used industrially.[5] These derivatives are generally less acidic than HCo(CO)4.[4] Tetracarbonylhydrocobalt was first described by Hieber in the early 1930s.[6] It was the second transition metal hydride to be discovered, after H2Fe(CO)4. It is prepared by reducing Co2(CO)8 with sodium amalgam or a similar reducing agent followed by acidification.[2] Since HCo(CO)4 decomposes so readily, it is usually generated in situ by hydrogenation of Co2(CO)8.[5] The thermodynamic parameters for the equilibrium reaction were determined by infrared spectroscopy to be H = 4.054 kcal mol1, S = -3.067 cal mol1 K1.[5] Tetracarbonylhydridocobalt was the first transition metal hydride to be used in industry.[7] In 1940 it was discovered that it catalyzed the conversion of alkenes, CO, and H2 to aldehydes, a process known as hydroformylation (Oxo Reaction). Although it has since been largely superseded by rhodium-based catalysts, the world output of C3-C18 aldehydes produced by tetracarbonylhydrocobalt catalysis is about 100,000 tons/year, roughly 2% of the total.[7]
