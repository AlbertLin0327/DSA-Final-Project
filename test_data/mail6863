John of Palisna (Croatian: Ivan od Paline, Latin: Joannes de Palisna) was a Croatian knight and warrior, prior of Vrana, and Ban of Croatia. It is unclear when John of Palisna became prior of Vrana.[1] In May 1381 he was already prior, because the citizens of Zadar were complaining about him to the King of Hungary and Croatia.[1] He co-ruled with relative Ivan (John) Anjou Horvat de Radics as a Ban of Croatia from 1385 to 1386, and in 1389. While John of Palisna was participating in the Battle of Kosovo with his contingent of Knights Hospitallers in the campaign against the Ottoman Empire, his enemies in Croatia took one of his last strongholds, the Klis Fortress.[1] Obviously, without the help from Bosnians, John was unable to resist Sigismund's allies, especially when he personally went away, to fight against the Ottomans.[1] John of Palisna opposed the rule of Elizabeth of Bosnia.[2] He was mainly opposed to the centralizing policy which Elizabeth's husband had enforced.[2] He hoped to regain local independence by rising against Elizabeth.[2] Elizabeth's own first cousin, Tvrtko I of Bosnia, with whom she was raised, decided to take advantage of Louis' death and Elizabeth's unpopularity by trying to recover the Dalmatian lands he had lost to Louis in 1357.[2] John of Palisna asked Tvrtko for help but was ultimately defeated by Elizabeth's army and forced to flee to Bosnia.[2]
