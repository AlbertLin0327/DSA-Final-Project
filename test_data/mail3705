True "Irish potato" candy, while most probably not Irish, is made from a small cooked potato, confectioner's sugar, vanilla extract, and usually includes coconut flakes. The potato is mashed, without any added liquid, and the confectioner's sugar is then added gradually. The coconut and vanilla are added while the mixture is still somewhat soft to make blending easier; and additional confectioner's sugar is added until a consistency is reached that will allow rolling into bite-sized, potato-shaped balls. The candy is allowed to dry for a couple of hours and then rolled in cinnamon to achieve the appearance of tiny potatoes. Drying the candy before rolling in the cinnamon keeps the cinnamon from becoming dark.[1] The recipe does not involve the use of heat after the cooking of the potato; and because of the initial reaction between the confectioner's sugar and the mashed potato. When the sugar is added to the mashed potato the mixture becomes liquid, then becomes gradually firmer as more sugar is added. Powdered cocoa can be substituted for the cinnamon for a slightly browner potato without the cinnamon's "bite". The coconut can be left out, or try dipping the candy in chocolate. The potato and confectioner's sugar makes a nice base for experimenting with other flavors, such as mint. There are also other types of potato candy, for which recipes can be easily found online. Commercially made Irish Potato Candy is a traditional Philadelphia confection, produced for over 100 years, that is not Irish and does not contain any potato.[2] The candies have a coconut cream inside (generally made from some blend of coconut, confectioner's sugar, vanilla, and cream or cream cheese) and are rolled in cinnamon on the outside, making them look like small potatoes.[2][3] The treats are about the size of a large marble and are especially popular around St. Patrick's Day.[2] Oh Ryan's of Boothwyn, Pennsylvania, makes the largest distribution of Irish Potatoes shipping about 80,000 pounds to major chains and smaller candy stores mostly in the Philadelphia area.[4] See's Candies based in South San Francisco also makes a version composed of a divinity and English walnut interior dusted with cocoa and using pine nuts as potato "eyes".[4] They are showcased as a seasonal product by Acme Markets.
