Chop Chop (foaled 1940) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. He was sired by Flares, a son of U.S. Triple Crown winner Gallant Fox and a full brother to U.S. Triple Crown winner, Omaha. Flares raced in England with considerable success for owner William Woodward, Sr. counting the Ascot Gold Cup, Champion Stakes and Princess of Wales's Stakes among his wins. Purchased as a yearling for $4,100 by Barclay K. Douglas of Oyster Bay, New York [1], Chop Chop's career in racing was cut short due to an injury. From eleven starts, he won four times and finished out of the money just once. His most important wins came in the 1942 Endurance Handicap at Bowie Race Track in Bowie, Maryland and the 1943 Empire City Handicap at New York's Jamaica Racetrack in which he beat Princequillo. Retired to stud duty, Chop Chop was sent to a breeding farm in Kentucky but in 1945 was leased by Gil Darlington, owner of Trafalgar Farm near Oakville, Ontario. Not given much consideration by most in the racing industry, Chop Chop did not attract any top quality mares for breeding and as a result his first five years in Canada showed nothing in the way of significant offspring until after he was sold when Chain Reaction began winning major races in 1953. Chop Chop's fortune would change when E. P. Taylor bought him at a dispersal sale and stood him at his National Stud of Canada in Oshawa, Ontario. Mated to Taylor's mare, Iribelle, their daughter Canadiana was foaled in 1950. Canadiana's success in racing resulted in Chop Chop being bred to the best of the Taylor mares and as a consequence, he was the leading sire in Canada from 1959 through 1963. Among his progeny, Chop Chop was the sire of four Queen's Plate winners and two Hall of Fame inductees: Through his daughter, Ciboulette, Chop Chop was the damsire of Eclipse and Sovereign Award winner and Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Fanfreluche. For his Contribution to Canadian racing, in 1977 Chop Chop was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.
