Raman Sundrum is an American theoretical particle physicist. His most famous contribution to the field is a class of models called the Randall-Sundrum models, first published in 1999 with Lisa Randall. Sundrum was one of two Alumni Centennial Professors in the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States. In 2010, he left the Johns Hopkins University and moved to the University of Maryland. His research is in theoretical particle physics and focuses on theoretical mechanisms and observable implications of extra spacetime dimensions, supersymmetry, and strongly coupled dynamics. According to Scientific American.com,[1] he was considering leaving Physics for Finance, when the now famous author and collaborator Lisa Randall called to propose working together on membranes, or "branes" as they are known. Branes are domains or swaths of several spatial dimensions within a higher-dimensional space. The fruits of that collaboration were papers known as RS-1 and RS-2, two of the most cited in physics for the past five years.[1] Raman Sundrum did his undergraduate studies in Australia and received his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1990.
