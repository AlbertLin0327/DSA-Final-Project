After graduating from their Primavera youth team. However, despite being called up to the first team he never made an official Serie A appearance for the Old Lady. In 200607 season he was loaned to Ascoli, made his team and Serie A debut on 10 September 2006, against Atalanta B.C.. After his successful spell at Ascoli where he would go on to score 6 goals in 32 Serie A appearances, he returned shortly to Juventus. In summer 2007, he moved to Udinese on joint-ownership deal, as part of the Vincenzo Iaquinta deal to join Juventus, as tagged for 1.35million.[1] He made his official game debut in Coppa Italia, scored two goals against A.S. Bari on 29 August 2007. . He made just 2 appearances in 5 months at Udinese In January 2008 Juventus and Udinese loaned him out to Atalanta, where he would play until 30 June 2008. During the 200809 summer transfer window, Juventus and Udinese again loaned Paolucci out, this time to Sicilian giants, Catania. He was a revalation for a high-flying Catania side who was fighting for UEFA Cup places until a mid-season stumble.[says who?] He scored 7 goals that season, in the Serie A and had been regularly included in first team action, under coach Walter Zenga. He made a total of 28 starts for the club. It was also the most successful Serie A season of his career. In June 2009, Paolucci returned to Udinese, but was immediately bought back fully by Juventus for 3.3million. On 8 July 2009 he joined Siena in co-ownership for the same price[2] in 5-year contract. Paolucci did not manage to hold down a regular starting place at Siena to some surprise, making just 10 Serie A appearances, and scoring just twice. After not obtaining a regular starting place and also due to Juventus' striker injury crisis, he was loan back by Juventus on 16 January 2010, by Juve paid Siena 500,000.[3] Originally acquired as addition to a injury ridden team, Paolucci never broke into the first team and ended his second Juve stint with only four league appearances before to return to Siena, now relegated in the Serie B league. After a disappointing period at Siena, with only one second-division appearance with the Tuscans, Paolucci accepted a loan move to Palermo on 31 January 2011, replacing the left of former Siena team-mate Massimo Maccarone.[4] He made his debut with the Sicilians only two days later, replacing Fabrizio Miccoli in the final minutes of a home game against his former team Juventus, ended in a 21 win for Palermo.[5] Siena elected to loan him out once again to Vicenza for the 2011-12 season after the club acquired the residual 50% rights from Juve for free.
