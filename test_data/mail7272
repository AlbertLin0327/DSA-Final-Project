James Russell Keays (30 October 1913  10 March 1995) was a Progressive Conservative party member of the Canadian House of Commons. Born in Newport, Quebec, he was an industrialist and manufacturer by career. Commonly known as Russell Keays,[2][3] he attained a Bachelor of Arts at Saint Joseph's University. In 1949, he became mayor of Gasp, Quebec and held that post until at least 1960.[1] He also founded La Cie de Bois de Baie Sud (South Bay Lumber) in the Gasp region which today is known as KEGA.[4] He was first elected at the les-de-la-Madeleine riding in the 1958 general election. After a term in Parliament, Keays was defeated in the 1962 federal election at les-de-la-Madeleine by Maurice Sauv of the Liberal party. In the 1965 election, Keays won the Gasp riding and returned to Parliament, but was again defeated in the following election in 1968 by Alexandre Cyr of the Liberal party. Keays did not seek any further re-election after that, but remained active within the Progressive Conservative party. He was part of a campaign team for Charles-Eugne Marin for the 1984 federal election. However, he and three other campaigners were fined for Canada Elections Act infractions in April 1986 for hiring scrutineers outside the purview of Marin's official agent.[5]
