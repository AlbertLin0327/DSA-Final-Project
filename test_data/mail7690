Tammy Cole (born 13 April 1973 in Queensland) is a retired female field hockey defender from Australia. She made her debut for the Australian women's national team in 1994 when Australia won the Tri Test series in Christchurch against Argentina and New Zealand. Nicknamed TC she returned to international competition after a two-year, injury-riddled absence in 1996. Cole has a specialist role on the post for defensive penalty corners and is equally comfortable in the midfield or wing half where she has played most of her international senior matches. Cole also represented Australia in indoor cricket in 1988 and 1989. She was a member of the Hockeyroos at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, where the team ended up in third place in the overall-rankings.
