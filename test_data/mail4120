The Whiteford Music Festival is a non-profit music festival, hosted every year on the grounds of the Whiteford House in Cornwall, UK. The festival is held over three days with Friday night swing, Saturday night orchestral 'Proms in the Park' with fireworks, and Sunday family chill-out. The festival celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2010, with a rest break in 2011 before a final return over the weekend of 15th-17th June 2012 to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. Despite the festival's award winning success and popularity for over a decade, 2012 is the last annual Whiteford Festival due to the retirement of the organising committee. This secular festival helps raise money for the physical (non-religious) maintenance and repair of the local Parish Church at Stoke Climsland and other charities including the Royal Marines Charitable Trust. The inaugural edition was held in 2001 with one band, and was not planned as an annual event.[1] Organised by the Friends of Stoke Climsland Parish Church, it expanded into a three-day festival.[2]
