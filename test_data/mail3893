numberGo is a multi-dimensional data viewing program written and distributed by numberGo for use with Microsoft Windows. It makes extensive use of pivot tables to give depth to flat data. Using the same source data, multiple Layouts can be created to allow the user to see the data from different perspectives. The product also includes extensive charting capabilities. Imported data and finished Layouts created within the numberGo Publisher can be saved to a .pcf (Portable Chart Format) file that allows anyone with the numberGo Reader to view it. This enables users to share the information they create using the numberGo Publisher. numberGo Publisher is the version that allows users to import data, create Layouts and Charts, and save data to a .pcf file. Currently supported import formats are Microsoft Excel, csv files, XML, Microsoft SQL, Oracle, and ODBC. The .pcf file can be sent to anyone with the numberGo Publisher or the numberGo Reader to be viewed. A plugin interface has been implemented to allow developers to create custom importers. numberGo Reader is the version that allows users to open an existing .pcf file to view its contents. With the Reader, the user still has the ability to create customized Layouts and Charts, but does not have the ability to create new .pcf files.
