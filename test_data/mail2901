The 17th Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival (Turkish: 17. Antalya Altn Portakal Film Festivali) was a film festival scheduled to be held in Antalya, Turkey, in 1980, which was cancelled due to the declaration of martial law throughout the country following the military coup on September 12, 1980. The awards for this and the preceding festival, which was also cancelled, re-christened Belated Golden Oranges (Turkish: Ge Gelen Altn Portallar), were presented at an award ceremony as part of the 48th International Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival, with the recipients chosen from the films originally selected as candidates by the original jury members selected to represent the competition. The original 1980 jury was to have consisted of Orhan Aksoy, Melih Cevdet Anday, Atilla Dorsay, Kami Suveren, Ara Gler, Kenan Deer, Erkal Gngren, Doan Hzlan, Ahmet Keskin, Ergin Orbey, Atilla zdemirolu , Nurettin Tekindor, Gani Turanl, Tongu Yaar and Tunca Ynder.[1][2][3] The reconstituted National Feature Film Competition Jury, headed by Prof. Dr. zdemir Nutku, awarded Belated Golden Oranges in eight categories.
