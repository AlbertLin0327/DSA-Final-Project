The Lofa Defense Force (LDF) was a rebel group that participated in the Liberian Civil War. It was a local group that crossed the northern border from Guinea to attack armed positions, mostly those of the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Kromah faction (ULIMO-K), in early 1994. The LDF was led by Francois Massaquoi and was estimated to have 750 combatants, mainly drawn from within Lofa County.
