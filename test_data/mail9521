Dick's Picks Volume 23 is a three-CD album by the rock group the Grateful Dead. It is the 23rd installment in the Dick's Picks series of live archival recordings. It was recorded on September 17, 1972 at the Baltimore Civic Center in Baltimore, Maryland.[4] It contains the complete concert, except for the encore, which was "One More Saturday Night".[5] Dick's Picks Volume 23 was released in 2001. It contains the longest CD version of the song "The Other One" to date, clocking in at nearly 40 minutes. More music from this period can be found on Dick's Picks Volume 11 and Dick's Picks Volume 36. Each volume of Dick's Picks has its own "caveat emptor" label, advising the listener of the sound quality of the recording. The one for Volume 23 reads: "Dick's Picks Twenty-Three was mastered from the original 1/4" analog tapes, running at 7.5 ips. The mix you hear was done live to two-track at the show, and the results are remarkable. We hope you'll dig it as much as we do."
