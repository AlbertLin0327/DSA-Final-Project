Jean Lon Jaurs (French pronunciation:[ .s]; full name Auguste Marie Joseph Jean Lon Jaurs; 3 September 1859 31 July 1914) was a French Socialist leader. Initially an Opportunist Republican, he evolved into one of the first social democrats, becoming the leader, in 1902, of the French Socialist Party, which opposed Jules Guesde's revolutionary Socialist Party of France. The two parties merged in 1905 in the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO). An antimilitarist, Jaurs was assassinated at the outbreak of World War I, and remains one of the main historical figures of the French Left. The son of an unsuccessful businessman and farmer, Jean Jaurs was born in Castres (Tarn), in a modest French provincial bourgeois family. He was the first cousin once removed of the admiral and senator Benjamin Jaurs, who was named Minister of the Navy and Colonies in 1889, and of the admiral Charles Jaurs. His younger brother, Louis, also became an admiral and a Republican-Socialist deputy. A brilliant student, Jaurs was educated at the Lyce Louis-le-Grand in Paris and admitted first at the cole normale suprieure, in philosophy, in 1878, ahead of Henri Bergson. He obtained his agrgation of philosophy in 1881, ending up third, and then taught philosophy for two years at the lyce of Albi, before lecturing at the University of Toulouse. He was elected Republican deputy for the dpartement of Tarn in 1885, sitting alongside the moderate Opportunist Republicans, opposed both to Georges Clemenceau's Radicals and to the Socialists. He then supported both Jules Ferry and Lon Gambetta. In 1889, after unsuccessfully contesting Castres, this time under the banner of Socialism, he returned to his professional duties at Toulouse, where he took an active interest in municipal affairs, and helped to found the medical faculty of the University. He also prepared two theses for his doctorate in philosophy, De primis socialismi germanici lineamentis apud Lutherum, Kant, Fichte et Hegel (1891), and De la ralit du monde sensible. Jean Jaurs was initially a moderate republican, opposed to both radicalism (such as that of Georges Clemenceau) and socialism. He developed into a socialist during the late 1880s. In 1892, Jaurs supported the miners of Carmaux when they went on strike over the dismissal of their leader, Jean Baptiste Calvignac. Jaurs' campaigning forced the government to intervene and require Calvignac's reinstatement. The following year, Jaurs was re-elected to the National Assembly as socialist deputy for Tarn, a seat he retained (apart from the four years 1898 to 1902) until his death. Defeated in the election of 1898 he spent four years without a legislative seat. His eloquent speeches nonetheless made him a force to be reckoned with as an intellectual champion of Socialism. He edited La Petite Rpublique, and was, along with Emile Zola, one of the most energetic defenders of Alfred Dreyfus (during the Dreyfus Affair that polarized the Right and Left). He approved of the inclusion of Alexandre Millerand, the socialist, in the Ren Waldeck-Rousseau cabinet, though this led to a split with the more revolutionary section led by Jules Guesde.[1] In 1902 Jaurs was again returned as deputy for Albi. Jaurs and the independent socialists merged in 1902 with Paul Brousse's "possibilist" (reformist) Federation of the Socialist Workers of France and with Jean Allemane's Revolutionary Socialist Workers Party to form the French Socialist Party, of which Jaurs became the leader. They represented a social democratic stance, opposed to Jules Guesde's revolutionary Socialist Party of France. During the Combes administration his influence secured the coherence of the Radical-Socialist coalition known as the Bloc des gauches, which enacted the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State. In 1904, he founded the socialist paper L'Humanit. Following the 1904 Amsterdam Congress of the Second International, the French socialist groups held a Congress at Rouen in March 1905, which resulted in a new consolidation, with the merger of Jaurs's French Socialist Party and Guesde's Socialist Party of France. The new party, headed by Jaurs and Guesde, ceased to co-operate with the Radical groups, and became known as the Parti Socialiste Unifi (PSU, Unified Socialist Party), pledged to advance a collectivist programme. All the socialist movements unified the same year in the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO). In the general elections of 1906, Jaurs was again elected for the Tarn. His ability was now generally recognized, but the strength of the SFIO still had to reckon with the vigorous radicalism of Georges Clemenceau, who was able to appeal to his countrymen (in a notable speech in the spring of 1906) to rally to a Radical programme which had no socialist ideas in view, although Clemenceau was sensitive to the conditions of the working class. Clemenceau's image as a strong and practical Radical leader considerably diminished the popularity of the socialists. Jaurs, in addition to his daily journalistic activity, published Les preuves; Affaire Dreyfus (1900); Action socialiste (1899); Etudes socialistes (1902), and, with other collaborators, Histoire socialiste (1901), etc. Jaurs travelled to Lisbon and Buenos Aires in 1911. He supported, albeit not without criticisms, the teaching of regional languages, such as Occitan, Basque and Breton, commonly known as "patois", thus opposing, in this issue, traditional Republican jacobinism.[2] Jaurs was a committed antimilitarist who tried to use diplomatic means to prevent what became the First World War. In 1913 he opposed mile Driant's law, which implemented a three-year draft period, and tried to promote understanding between France and Germany. As conflict became imminent, he tried to organise general strikes in France and Germany in order to force the governments to back down and negotiate. This proved difficult, however, as many Frenchmen sought revenge (revanche) for their country's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War and the return of the lost Alsace-Lorraine territory. On 31 July 1914 Jaurs was assassinated in a Parisian caf, Le Croissant, 146 rue Montmartre, by Raoul Villain, a 29-year-old French nationalist. Jaurs had been due to attend a conference of the International on 9 August, in an attempt to dissuade the belligerents from going ahead with the war.[3] Villain was tried after World War I and acquitted but was killed by Spanish Republicans in 1936. Ten years after his death, Jaurs's remains were transferred to the Panthon.[4]
