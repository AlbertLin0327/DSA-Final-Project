Asaf Jah I was then dispatched to gain complete control of six Mughal provinces in the Deccan. Muhammad Amin Khan Turani was assigned by the reigning Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah as the Mansabdar of 8000 he was sent to peruse the Mughal Grand Vizier Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha, who was defeated at the Battle of Hasanpur by Muhammad Amin Khan Turani, Mir Muhammad Amin Irani and Muhammad Haider Beg and was captured by the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah on 15 November, 1720 and was executed 2 years later. Previously the emperor had to fight Prince Muhammad Ibrahim, but young Muhammad Shah defeated him on 13 November 1720. The fall of the Sayyid Brothers marked the beginning of the end of the Mughal Empire's direct control over its dominions in the Deccan.
