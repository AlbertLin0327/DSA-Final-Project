The Purgatoire River is a river in southeastern Colorado, United States. The river is also known locally as the Purgatory River or the Picketwire River.[1] The Purgatoire River originates at the confluence of the North Fork Purgatoire River and Middle Fork Purgatoire River near Weston in Las Animas County, Colorado, and flows generally east-northeastward approximately 196 miles (315km)[2] to a confluence with the Arkansas River in John Martin Reservoir State Park near Las Animas in Bent County, Colorado. The Purgatoire River drains an area of 3,447 square miles (8,930km2). 96.4% of this area is in Colorado, the remaining 3.6% is in New Mexico.[3] The Pion Canyon Maneuver Site is a large military base located along the western bank of the Purgatoire river. Plans by the U.S. army to expand the base have been controversial. Citizen's groups have succeeded in stopping the planned expansion as of 2011.[4]
