The transportation system of Georgia is a cooperation of complex systems of infrastructure. In March 2011, Georgia ranked as a bottom-seven "Worst" state (tied with Illinois and Oklahoma ) in the American State Litter Scorecard. The Peach State suffers from overall poor effectiveness and quality of its statewide public space cleanliness (primarily from roadway and adjacent litter/debris abatement)--due to state and related eradication standards and performance indicators.[1] MARTA is composed of both heavy rail rapid transit and a bus transit system that operates primarily within the boundaries of Fulton and DeKalb counties. In addition to Atlanta istelf, the transit agency serves the following incorporated places within these two core counties: Alpharetta, Avondale Estates, Chamblee, Clarkston, College Park, Decatur, Doraville, Dunwoody, East Point, Fairburn, Hapeville, Lithonia, Palmetto, Pine Hill, Roswell, Sandy Springs, Stone Mountain, Union City. Outside of the immediate service area, MARTA also serves the Airport Station and 7 miles (11km) of rail that are located in Clayton County[2] and one bus route to Cobb County's Cumberland Boulevard Transfer Center.[3] MARTA formerly operated bus service to Farmers Market in Clayton County as well as Forest Park before the now-defunct C-TRAN took over operation in the mid-2000s. Major freight railroads in Georgia include CSX and Norfolk Southern. Passenger service in Georgia is available on two Amtrak routes: the Crescent, which runs from New York to Washington, D.C., through north Georgia and Atlanta to New Orleans and the other runs from New York to the Georgia coast and from there to Florida.[4] The River Street Streetcar is a heritage streetcar line in Savannah, Georgia. It began regular operation on February 11, 2009 and shuttles between 7 stops along River Street, next to the Savannah River.[5] The state of Georgia has 1,244 miles of interstate highway within its borders. Georgia's major Interstate Highways are I-95, I-75, I-16, I-85, I-20 . Other important interstate highways are I-24 and I-59. I-285 is Atlanta, Georgia's perimeter route and I-575 connects with counties in north Georgia on I-75.[6] The Georgia Department of Transportation maintains only 16 percent of the roads in the state. The other 84 percent are the responsibility of the counties and cities; 75 percent of those roads are county roads.[7] The Sidney Lanier Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Brunswick River in Brunswick, Georgia, carrying four lanes of U.S. Route 17. The current bridge was built as a replacement to the original lift bridge which was twice struck by ships. It is currently the longest spanning bridge in Georgia and is 480 feet tall. It is also the seventy-sixth largest cable-stayed bridge in the world. It was named for poet Sidney Lanier. Each year (usually in February), there is the "Bridge Run" sponsored by Southeast Georgia Health System when the south side of the bridge is closed to traffic and people register to run (or walk) the bridge. The Chetoogeta Mountain Tunnel refers to two different railroad tunnels passing through Chetoogeta Mountain in northwestern Georgia, USA. The first tunnel was completed on May 7, 1850, as part of the construction of the Western & Atlantic Railroad (W & A), the first state road in Georgia. It was the first major railroad tunnel in the South and is 1,447 feet[8]/0.27mi or 441 meters in length. It was renovated in 1998-2000 and is now open to the public as a privately-owned historic site.[9] The second tunnel was built from 1926 to 1928 and is 1,557 feet[10]/0.3mi or 475 meters long. It is still in use by CSX Transportation, under lease from the Georgia Department of Transportation.[8] It, like the entire W & A subdivision, is a major route between Atlanta and Chattanooga. The nearby town of Tunnel Hill, Georgia (originally Tunnelsville) was created and named for the first tunnel, and was the supply base for its construction materials and worker housing.[9] Georgia has a system of State Bicycle Routes.[11] There are 1,600 taxi certificates in Atlanta. The Port of Savannah is a major U.S. seaport located at Savannah, Georgia. Its extensive facilities for oceangoing vessels line both sides of the Savannah River approximately 18 miles (29km) from the Atlantic Ocean. Operated by the Georgia Ports Authority (GPA), the Port of Savannah competes primarily with the Port of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina to the northeast, and the Port of Jacksonville in Jacksonville, Florida to the south. The GPA operates one other Atlantic seaport in Georgia, the Port of Brunswick, located at Brunswick, Georgia, as well as two interior ports linked to the Gulf of Mexico, Port Bainbridge and Port Columbus. Between 2000 and 2005 alone, the Port of Savannah was the fastest-growing seaport in the United States, with a compounded annual growth rate of 16.5 percent (the national average is 9.7 percent). The Georgia Rail Passenger Program is a plan for seven railway commuter routes to serve the Atlanta suburbs and nearby cities. The Athens route will connect nine of Georgia's colleges and universities, including Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia State University, Emory University, Georgia Gwinnett College, and the University of Georgia. Furthermore, the commuter rail will link the Centers for Disease Control, the new Paul D. Coverdell Center for Biomedical and Health Sciences, as well as the emerging BioScience Corridor along Georgia State Route 316. The route is estimated to divert 1.8 million drivers from the highways by 2025.[16] As many as 8,000 individuals or more could conceivably use the system every day, and it could remove 5,300 cars daily from already overtaxed roadways during peak travel times. Also, previous studies have indicated that commuter rail is 25 times safer than driving.
