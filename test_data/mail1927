Skiing in India is an activity that mostly takes place in the northern states of India, where the Himalayas are situated. Skiing is administered by the Indian Mountaineering Foundation in India. The Himalayas provide an excellent skiing experience owing due their grat height which makes for long descents. Heliskiing is also gaining popularity in places like Manali and Gulmarg.[1] However skiing in India suffers from lack of infrastructure. There are also security concerns in Gulmarg which is 20km from the Line of Control, however since 2002, it has been peaceful, which has led to an increase in skiing activity in the region.[2] Some of the most popular skiing locations in India are Gulmarg in Jammu and Kashmir, Solang in Himachal Pradesh and Auli in Uttaranchal. The skiing season in India is from January to March.
