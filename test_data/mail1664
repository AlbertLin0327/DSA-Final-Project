Kri Slmundarson was a Hebridean viking and soldier of fortune who lived in the late tenth and early eleventh centuries. He is a major character in Njl's Saga. Kri was the son of Solmund, who was the son of Thorbjorn "Jarl's Champion," an Icelander exiled before the establishment of the Althing for murder.[1] Kri was a hirdman of Sigurd the Stout, jarl of Orkney. He came to the rescue of Helgi Njlsson and Grim Njlsson, the sons of Njll orgeirsson of Bergthorshvoll, Iceland in the 990's. The brothers, who were on a trading expedition to the British Isles, had come under attack by the vikings Snaekolf and Grjotgard Mordansson. After killing the raiders, Kri brought the Njlssons to Orkney, where they stayed for a time at Jarl Sigurd's court and fought in his campaigns in northern and central Scotland.[2] Kri came to the aid of Helgi and Grim again when the brothers were arrested by Hakon Jarl of Norway for aiding in the escape of their fellow Icelander, Thrain Sigfusson.[3] When Helgi and Grim returned to Iceland, Kri accompanied them. He bought a landholding at Dyrholmar, but settled at Bergthorshvoll, where he married Njl's daughter Helga and became close friends with Njl's son Skarphinn.[4] He likely became at least nominally a Christian when Iceland converted during the Althing of 1000. Kri became entangled in the Njlssons' blood feud with the clan of Thrain Sigfusson, and participated in Skarphinn's ambush and murder of Thrain.[5] In around 1010, Thrain's allies and kinsmen, led by Flosi rarson, attacked Bergthorshvoll and burned it with its inhabitants inside. Kri managed to escape under cover of smoke, but his friends Helgi and Skarphinn were both killed. Njl, his wife Bergthora, and Kri's son Thord all refused Flosi's offer of reprieve and died in the flames.[6] Kri gathered supporters and prompted the prosecution of the Burners, and there is a legal joust between the parties. Fighting broke out and almost escalated into a full-scale civil war until Snorri Goi and his followers separated the belligerents. As part of an imposed settlement, the Burners were exiled for three years, but Kri attacked them on their way home, and pursued those who escaped abroad. Kri and a small group of followers spent the next several years taking vengeance on the Burners in them to Orkney and Wales. In a particularly brazen display, Kri entered the hall of Jarl Sigurd of Orkney as Gunnar Lambason was telling a slanderous version of the story of the burning of Bergthorshvoll. Kri killed Gunnar and composed the verse: Kri stayed in Caithness during the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, when Jarl Sigurd and his allies fought against Brian Boru, High King of Ireland. During his stay in Scotland his wife Helga died. Flosi returned to Iceland after a pilgrimage to Rome. Kri followed, but was shipwrecked near Flosis home. Testing Flosis nobility he went to him for help, and they arranged a final peace. Kri married Flosi's niece Hildigunn, who was the widow of Hoskuld Thrainsson, the son of Thrain Sigfusson and foster-son of Njl. Kri had four children with Helga, his first wife: his son Thord, who died during the Burning of Bergthorshvoll, and the daughters Thorgerd, Ragnheid, and Valgerd. By his second wife Hildigunn, Kri had three sons: Starkad, Thord and Flosi. Flosi's son Kolbein became a powerful chieftain in the mid eleventh century.
