Content:
The oxide mineral class includes those minerals in which the oxide anion (O2-) is bonded to one or more metal ions. The hydroxide bearing minerals are typically included in the oxide class. The minerals with complex anion groups such as the silicates, sulfates, carbonates and phosphates are classed separately. Simple oxides: Hyroxide subgroup: IMA-CNMNC proposes a new hierarchical scheme (Mills et al., 2009). This list uses it to modify the Classification of NickelStrunz (10 ed, pending publication).
