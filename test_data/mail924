The Simple English Wikipedia is an English edition of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia, primarily written in Basic English and Special English.[1] Founded in 2003, the site has the stated aim of providing an encyclopedia for "people with different needs, such as students, children, adults with learning difficulties and people who are trying to learn English".[2] As of March 2011, the site contains over 80,000 content pages, and has more than 227,000 registered users, whereas 735 are currently active.[3] Articles on the Simple English Wikipedia are usually shorter than their English Wikipedia counterparts, typically presenting only basic information: Tim Dowling of the Guardian newspaper explained that "the Simple English version tends to stick to commonly accepted facts".[4] The interface is also more simply labeled; for instance, the "Random article" link on the English Wikipedia is replaced with a "Show Any Page" link; users are invited to "change" rather than "edit" pages; clicking on a red link shows a "not yet started" message rather than the usual "page does not exist".[5] The project uses around 2,000 common English words,[1] and is based on Basic English, an 850-word auxiliary international language created by Charles Kay Ogden in the 1920s.[4] Simple English Wikipedia's basic presentation style makes it ideal for beginners learning English.[6] Material from the Simple English Wikipedia forms the basis for One Encyclopedia per Child,[7] an OLPC project.[8]
