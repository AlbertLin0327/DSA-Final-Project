Miliariconus aristophanes (G. B. Sowerby II, 1857) Conus aristophanes is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.[1] These snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of "stinging" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
