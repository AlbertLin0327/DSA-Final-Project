Sheikh Muhammad Chishty, (Persian:  - it) (Arabic:  - Shishti) better known as Khwaja Sheikh Pak (The pure Sheikh) was an Islamic Kutb and a Waliullah. He is also known as Khwaja Garib Nawaz-E-Sani, a title given to him based upon his similarities with the earlier Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti of Ajmer. Khwaja Sheikh Pak was born into a religious family in Lahore, Pakistan. His father Imamuddin was a mufti and imam of sunehri mosque in Lahore. As a child he left in pursuit of mystical knowledge, settling in the Hejaz region of what is today Saudi Arabia.. Educated in Qur'an and Hadith, he busied himself in prayers and devotion to God. Over a period of 40 years he continued his ibaadah until one night he had a dream in which Muhammad ordered him to go back to Pakistan and take Ba'it (initiation into a Sufi Tariqah) into the Chishtiyya Silsilla from a Murshid known as Khwaja Hamid. Still revered today as a saint of very high order, Khwaja Sheikh Pak was said to have been a charismatic and spiritual individual who devoted his life to Islamic mysticism and to helping others. The following is a narration of an incident that took place which emphasised to his contemporaries the extent of his spirituality. Sheikh Pak was immersed in the love of Allah. Once when he was in the famous Badshi Mughal mosque in Lahore, the Imam reading the prayer sensed something. He called his companions and said to them that he felt that there was someone present in that mosque today, that if they prayed behind him they would go to heaven. They searched everywhere and they found him. In appearance, Khwaja Sheikh Pak was said to be the most handsome man in the whole of Pakistan in that era. They knew it was him from the glow emanating from him. They asked him "Will you lead the prayer? We wish to enter the gardens of Jannah". He replied "To go to Paradise, all you need to do is look at me". At his shrine in Lahore there is a door known as the Bahishti darwaza, which opens once a year only for the Urs. This is to symbolize that he was the only person in the whole world twinned Baba Farid Shakar Ganj who had the Paradise of God at his feet. The noble soul of Khwaja Garib Nawaz Sani left his body in 1926 at the age of 118. When he died, his followers believed that he should be buried in Makkah/Medina, so they did so. Only after they had buried him, he rose from the grave in his coffin. Moved by this event, they took to Ajmer to lay next to Moinuddin Chishti. They buried him but once again he rose. Finally they took him to his home town where he grew up for the first five years of his life and there he settled. His shrine stands there today. His shrine is more commonly known as Khwaja wali Darbar. He is buried in the centre, and his descendants around him. His grave is raised in marble out of respect for the saint, and flower wreaths and petals scattered over him. Many people from all over Pakistan come and make Ziyarat every year. Every year hundreds of people gather at the Darbar and celebrate the life of the pious saint. The Urs is a ceremony that commemorates the death of the saint, which is seen as a union with God. It is a ceremony mainly carried out by the Chishti Order of South East Asia. First of all his grave is showered with fresh flowers, often roses. Then the saint's devotees carry a sheet of material with Quranic inscriptions on it, known as a chaadar. There are normally 3-4 chaadars which are placed on the grave. They carry them through the Bahishti darwaza which only opens once a year for this ceremony. It is said that whoever goes through that door they will go to heaven. The procession continues with the playing of loud Qawalli, many people lose themselves in spiritual ectasy and seek blessings of the saints. Every year URS of Hazrat Khawaja Shaik Pak Ghareeb Nawaz Rehmat-Ul-lah Taala Alaihe also celebrate at Khawaja Muhammad Feroz-Ud-Din Ghareeb Nawaz Chishti Nizami in Lahore at Bahawalpur Road, Gulstan-e-Miani Sahib,Lahore.
