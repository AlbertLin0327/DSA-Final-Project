Richard Merrill was a Digital Equipment Corporation employee who invented the FOCAL programming language and programmed the first two interpreters for the language in 1968 and 1969, for the PDP-8. He also developed later versions of the interpreter for the PDP-7 and PDP-9, and he was most likely the author of the PDP-11 FOCAL interpreter.[citation needed] Merrill wrote The Sumer Game (later popularized as Hamurabi) in 1969 in FOCAL, programming it on a DEC PDP-8.[1] Merrill also designed and programmed the EDIT-8 text editor (using paper-tape).[2]
