Persian powder is a Plant toxin insecticide powder, also called "Persian Pellitory" and Insect powder.[1] Persian powder is a green pesticide that has been used for centuries for the biological pest extermination of household insects, garden pests, and agricultural pests. [2] It is used indoors, in gardens and the horticulture industry, and in agriculture. It is produced from the powdered flowers of certain species of Pyrethrum, in the genera Chrysanthemum and Tanacetum. In more recent times it has had formulations with brand names such as Zacherlin. [3] Pyrethroids are synthetic insecticides based on natural pyrethrum ( pyrethrins ), such as one common example permethrin. A common formulation of pyrethrin is in preparations containing the synthetic chemical piperonyl butoxide: this has the effect of enhancing the toxicity to insects and speeding the effects when compared with pyrethrins used alone. These formulations are known as synergized pyrethrins. In Iran Persian powder is also a name given to a type of dry snow in the Zagros Mountains.
