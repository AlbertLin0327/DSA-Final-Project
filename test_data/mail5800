Vetrov Hill (6634S 9258E / 66.567S 92.967E / -66.567; 92.967Coordinates: 6634S 9258E / 66.567S 92.967E / -66.567; 92.967) is a hill rising to 20 m, standing at the east side of the entrance to McDonald Bay on the coast of Antarctica. It was mapped from aerial photos taken by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump, 194647, and later remapped by the Soviet expedition of 1956 which named it Vetrov, meaning "windy." This article incorporatespublic domain material from the United States Geological Survey document "Vetrov Hill" (content from the Geographic Names Information System).
