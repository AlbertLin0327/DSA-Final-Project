Maro Charithra (Telugu:  ) is a 1978 Telugu-language Indian feature film directed by K. Balachander, starring Kamal Haasan, Saritha, Madhavi and Sarath Babu. The film still remains as one of the biggest blockbusters. Later in 1981, it was remade in Hindi-language as Ek Duuje Ke Liye with Kamal Haasan and Rati Agnihotri and became a blockbuster as well. The story revolves around a Telugu girl and Tamil boy who fall in love. Their families interfere and ask them to stay away from each other for a whole year which results in a tragic end.
