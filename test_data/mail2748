The Apollo of Bellac (French title: L'Apollon de Bellac or L'Apollon de Marsac) is a comedic one act play written in 1942 by French dramatist Jean Giraudoux. The play is set in the reception room of the International Bureau of Inventions, during autumn in Paris. It focuses on a timid, young woman by the name of Agnes. After she arrives, she is given the most powerful secret in life by a homeless man from the little town of Bellac.[1] Like Giraudoux himself, the man comes from the Limousin region of France. The secret he gives her is to tell all men that they are handsome ("How handsome you are!" or "Comme vous tes beau!") and they will play right into your hands. She quickly catches on and the men of the Bureau fall for her left and right. In the Valency translation, it ends with her meeting the handsome (and single) Chairman of the Board, and everyone wondering what has happened to the great man (the homeless inventor) who quietly slipped away. L'Apollon de Bellac was translated into English by Maurice Valency, in Jean Giraudoux, Four Plays, vol. 1 (1958), and 1957 by Ronald Duncan.[2] The Apollo of Bellac was first performed as L'Apollon de Marsac on 16 June 1942[3] at the Municipal Theater in Rio de Janeiro.[4][5][6] The first performance in Paris was on 19 April 1947 at the Thtre de l'Athne in a production by Louis Jouvet.[7] Cast at the Paris premiere included Dominique Blanchar, as Agnes; Lucienne Bogaert, as Therese; Louis Jouvet, as "The Man from Bellac"; and Jacques Monod, as Mr Cracheton. In 1955, in Tony Richardson's directing dbut,[8] the play was produced for Television with Denholm Elliott and Natasha Parry in the main roles.[1]
