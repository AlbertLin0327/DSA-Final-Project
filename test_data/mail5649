Halo were a rock band from Bristol, England, who formed in 1999 and disbanded in 2004. In 2002, they released one album, and had three singles in the UK Singles Chart.[1] Halo started out as a four piece in 1999, performing their first gig at Louisiana Bar, Bristol. The band's founder members the Moncrieff brothers had been playing together prior to Halo, with Graeme teaching younger brother Iain to play on his father's acoustic guitar at the age of 16. With the pair both playing guitar, Iain came up with the idea of getting a drummer and bassist to form a band. They called themselves 'Chaser' although they were short lived, splitting due to musical differences. In 1999 The Moncrieff's started auditions to form a new band, when Jim Davey was to be appointed the drummer and Steve Yeomans was given the roll as bassist. Performing in and around Bristol, Halo's first release Still Here was recorded in a studio near Bristol. The quartet was spotted by Sony Music Entertainment towards the end of 2001, and partnered with Al Clay they produced their debut album, Lunatic Ride. It was released in 2002 and was to have three singles spawned from it. On the wave of the album Halo toured with Serafin, Wheatus and Rachel Stamp. In 2003 Davey left to pursue other aspirations and was replaced by Blake, but by 2004 the group had disbanded. Their next venture, The Vega Method, disbanded in 2006. Three of the original members of Halo (Graeme Moncrieff, Iain Moncrieff and Steve Yeomans) recruited drummer John Beavan late in 2007 and are now known as The Exhibition.[2][dead link] In 2011 the band reformed for a one-off gig at The Fleece in Bristol.[3] CD1 CD2 CD1 CD2
