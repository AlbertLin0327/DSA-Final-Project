Lee Cowling (born 22 September 1977, in Doncaster, England) is an English former professional footballer who played in the Football League as a defender for Nottingham Forest and Mansfield Town. Born in Doncaster, Cowling started his career as a trainee at Manchester United, after they spotted him playing junior league football in Doncaster, beating Sheffield Wednesday and Arsenal to his signature. A regular in their youth teams and the England schoolboy setup alongside players such as Paul Scholes, Phil and Gary Neville and David Beckham, Lee never appeared for their first team before moving to Nottingham Forest in 1995, where he also represented England at U-18 level. After a brief stint at Mansfield Town, the club at which his father, Dave Cowling started his career, a reoccurring knee injury forced him to retire in his early twenties. He later signed for non-league Kettering in 2000, where he made 32 appearances in two seasons with the club, before being released on a free transfer. Lee is a UEFA A qualified coach who also holds The FA Youth Coaches Award and the Futsal Coaching qualification. Lee has previously worked as an academy coach at Championship side Middlesbrough, and now coaches at two football development colleges in the north of England. His father is ex-football player Dave Cowling 1. http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=1708 2. http://www.clubwebsite.co.uk/soccerplanet/club_bespoke.pl?page_select=3082
