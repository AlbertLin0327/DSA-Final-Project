The "Siquitibum" or "Chiquitibum" is a chant heard at Mexican sporting events. Among other well-known chants are the "Goya", the chant of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), arguably created by the supporters of the university's American Football team; and the "Welum" or "Gelum", the chant sung by UNAM's traditional rival Instituto Politcnico Nacional or IPN, which has become popular institute-wide in a similar fashion. The Chiquitibum/Siquitibum cheer goes as follows: "Chiquitibum a la bim bom ba, chiquitiboom a la bim bom ba, a la bio, a la bao, a la bim bom ba, Mexico Mexico, Rah rah rah!!!" This most famous of Mexican cheers appeared at Mexican League and university soccer games during the late 1920s, and there is some speculation that the "Bim Bom Ba" was derived from the American "sis boom bah."[citation needed]
