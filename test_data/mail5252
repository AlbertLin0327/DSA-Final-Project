September 21, 2003(2003-09-21) (aged83) Moreshwar Nilkanth Pingley (  ), often referred as 'Moropant', was a senior RSS leader in India. He is merited (in Marathi) as "  ", literally, "Commander of Hindu awakening". During his 65 years of service as a   (Sangh Pracharak: one who is appointed to instill the culture and values of RSS amongst people), he held numerous berths, most notable of them being the     (All-India Intellectuals Chief). He was one of the six unofficial Sarsanghchalaks during the 1975 emergency in India. He was reported by the Indian media as the "Field Marshal" of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, which resulted in the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992. Numerous projects were undertaken under his mentorship: - (research on cows),    (tracing the underground Saraswati river),   (re-writing Indian history), to name a few. This made him earn the title of Sangh's   (literally, Project-Man). Moropant shunned publicity. He would be best described as one who is everywhere yet nowhere; well-known and yet less known, pervasive and yet never intrusive and lived in the true spirit of a Swayamsevak. Moropant was one of the few honed under the mentorship of both Dr.Hedgewar and Shri Guruji. After graduating with a Bachelor's degree in English in 1941, he became a full time   (Sangh Pracharak). In 1946, at the age of 26, he was appointed as  (assistant to Pracharak at state level) of Maharashtra. His most notable contribution during his early years was bridging the gap between factions in RSS, which developed due to rumours relating to Shri Guruji's involvement in Mahatma Gandhi's murder. The conversion of hundreds of Hindus at Meenakshipuram in 1981 led to organisation of the first Ekatmata Yatra [1] ( ) by VHP in 1983. Due to his excellent organisational skills, Moropant was given the responsibility of planning, co-ordinating and executing the Yatra. During its planning, Moropant extensively traveled around India. His effective selection of routes to be taken by the Ekatmata Raths (chariots), magnified the impact of the Yatra. The first Ekatmata Yatra in 1983 was followed by the "Ram-Janki" Rath Yatra in 1984. It was a precursor to the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. The aim of this Yatra was to reunite the Hindus, and to kindle the feeling of pride amongst them. Seven chariots traveled through Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, where Lord Shriram was shown behind bars depicting His state inside the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Moropant was appointed as the convener and contoller of this Yatra. In 1986, the Faizabad court ordered to unlock the temple marking the awakening of the Hindu society.
