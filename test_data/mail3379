Stewart 'Stewie' Geddes (born 6 March 1879) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Melbourne and St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Geddes arrived from Richmond Juniors as a defender but was used mostly on the ball by Melbourne. He took part in the historic 1897 VFL finals series and played in the 1900 VFL Grand Final, where he kicked one of Melbourne's four goals to help them claim their maiden premiership. While awaiting to be granted clearance to St Kilda, Geddes missed the 1903 and 1904 season. He arrived at St Kilda in 1905 but only played for one year. He later played with West Torrens, captaining the South Australian Football League club in 1908 and 1909. Appointed coach in 1914, Geddes steered them to fourth and fifth places in his two seasons in charge.
