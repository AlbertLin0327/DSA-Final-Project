Mats Lindgren (born 1 October 1974 in Skellefte, Sweden) is a former Swedish professional ice hockey forward. He was selected in the first round of the 1993 NHL Entry Draft, 15th overall, by the Winnipeg Jets, although he never had the opportunity to play for them. Despite versatility and a good on-ice work ethic, Lindgren never lived up to the offensive potential that Winnipeg had seen when they drafted him, scoring only thirteen goals in his best NHL season. In fact, in 387 games with the Edmonton Oilers, New York Islanders and the Vancouver Canucks, Lindgren scored only 54 goals. A large reason for Lindgren's poor offensive record has been the number of injuries he has suffered. In 9 seasons playing in North America, Lindgren only played one where he missed no time due to injury. Back surgery effectively ended his career. He announced his retirement due to injury on 20 January 2005, despite being only thirty years old. Lindgren represented Sweden at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. After his professional career ended he moved back to his hometown of Skellefte, Sweden where he became assistant coach for Skellefte AIK.
