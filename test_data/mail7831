Total War: Shogun 2 is a strategy video game developed by The Creative Assembly and published by Sega. It is the latest installment in the Total War series and returns to the 16th-century Japan setting of the first Total War game, Shogun: Total War, after a series of games set mainly in Europe. The game was released on 15 March 2011. Shogun 2 received critical praise from reviewers. Facets praised include the simplification and refinement of the series by returning to its roots. Shogun 2 is set in 16th-century feudal Japan, in the aftermath of the nin War. The country is fractured into rival clans led by local warlords, each fighting for control. The player takes on the management of one of these clans, with the goal of dominating other factions and claiming his rule over Japan. The standard edition of the game features a total of eight factions (plus a ninth faction for the tutorial), each with a unique starting position and different political and military strengths. The limited edition includes an exclusive ninja clan, the Hattori, and a DLC unlocks a tenth clan, the Ikko-Ikki.[2][3] The game moves away from the European setting of previous Total War games and returns to the first setting in the Total War series, but making significant changes to core gameplay elements of Shogun 2. For example, to reflect the characteristics of East Asian warfare, the game's AI is designed on the principles of Sun Tzu's The Art of War. Also, compared to Empire which spanned almost the entire globe, the new installment focuses only on the islands of Japan (excluding Hokkaido) and on a reduced number of unit types.[2] Shogun 2 has a combination of turn-based strategy and real-time tactics gameplay, a staple of the Total War series.[4] The player plays the role of both the clan leader and general, alternating between the campaign, where the player manages his land and armies turn by turn, and the battles, where the player takes control of the army on the battlefield in real-time.[5] In the campaign, the player needs to oversee the development of settlements, military production, economic growth, and technological advancement. The armies and units are organized and moved around the stylised campaign map by the player to carry out battles with other factions. In addition to fighting, the player is able to engage in diplomacy, political maneuvering, and special agents to gain the upper hand. Ninja and geisha are also present in the game as assassins and spies.[5] While religion isn't as relevant as it was in Medieval II, it can't be neglected by the player. Greater interaction with the European foreigners (Nanban traders), for example, to enhance trade and acquire firearms, exposes the clan to Christianity, which will seriously increase religious unrest in the provinces. Religious agents, such as monks and priests can be used to convert the enemy population. There are nine different clans that inhabit the provinces of Japan which the player chooses from[6] (plus one more included in the Limited Edition of the game, and one added through DLC).[7] All Clans have particular advantages in certain areas, in order to give a variety of play style with each. In Total War: Shogun 2, leaders and generals are given personality and depth in gameplay, with emphasis on role-playing. Generals and agents are portrayed as "larger-than-life" heroes with unique characteristics and powerful abilities. The player is able to improve and unlock traits and special abilities for the characters as they gain experience. However, the player may also be inclined to engage in family politics within the clan to keep its members loyal.[5] The battles of Shogun 2 involve large-scale engagements between armies that meet on the campaign map and can take place on land or on water. The developers proclaim they are paying particular attention to re-designing the naval and siege battles appropriate to the new setting. In contrast to European castles and forts, the castles in feudal Japan had multiple tiers, and thus the siege battles in the game will put less focus on wall defences but more on courtyard brawls and tactical manoeuvring. Also, the players will fight naval battles with unique Japanese ships resembling "floating castles", and take into consideration melees on ships, arrow fire, coastal terrain, and other factors.[3] Like the recent installments, Empire and Napoleon, the weather and climatic conditions have effect on battles. For example, fog greatly reduces visibility, while heavy rain diminishes the effectiveness of missile troops, such as archers or gunners, thus requiring the players to adapt their strategies. Also, as in Napoleon Total War, armies standing on enemy provinces during winter season or fleets far from the coast suffer atrittion. Shogun 2 features multiplayer battles with up to 8 players as well as multiplayer campaigns involving competitive or cooperative play with 2 players.[8] In a multiplayer campaign, players can be grouped into different clans, so that for each clan, one player assumes the role of clan leader and others take command of armies. The clan leader has the ability to direct other players and assign rewards based on loyalty and performance, introducing clan politics into multiplayer. As a player's army invades an enemy territory or is attacked by enemy armies, the online matchmaker finds a suitable opponent and initiates a multiplayer battle. When a player defeats enemy armies and conquers territories, the player will gain points and other bonuses for the clan. In addition, an achievement system is designed to provide adhering players with unique abilities and cosmetic upgrades.[9] Shogun 2 was released in four different editions. The "Standard Edition" contains just the game, while the "Limited Edition" additionally makes playable a unique faction with special talents (the Hattori Clan), an additional historical battle scenario 'Nagashino', a complete set of armour for the player's online avatar and a starting bank of experience points to spend on that online character. The "Collector's Edition" will include the Limited Edition content as well as a replica bamboo box containing a Shogun 2 art book and a detailed figurine of Takeda Shingen. The "Grand Master's edition" consists of the Collector's edition, as well as a bamboo Shogun 2 themed chess set, currently exclusive to select stores in the UK and Australia.[10][11] There are 9 Clans[6] plus one more clan if one buys the Limited Edition Box.[7] The Ikko-Ikki Clan Pack (released on May 26, 2011) adds the iconic "warrior monk" clan to Shogun 2 and a wide variety of brand-new content for use across the different game modes of Shogun 2.[14] Set 400 years before the dramatic civil war depicted in SHOGUN 2, the Rise of The Samurai campaign is based on the Genpei War, a conflict between six legendary clans of the Taira, Minamoto and Fujiwara families. It culminated in the first Shogunate, and the rise of the Samurai as the ruling class. Rise of the Samurai DLC pack adds new units in multiplayer and single player battles. 16 new land units spread across swordsmen, spearmen, archers, and cavalry. These include: Foot Samurai  Masters of bow and sword, these Samurai are deadly at range or in melee. They may not be the most numerous units, but they are perhaps the most effective. Also protected by distinctive Gempei-period armour which gives excellent protection at range and in melee. Sword Attendants  Armed with huge two-handed swords, these fearsome warriors can carve a bloody path in melee. 4 new Hero units  the Naginata Warrior Monk Hero, the Tetsubo Warrior Monk Hero, the Mounted Samurai Hero and the Onna Bushi Heroine  Armed with Naginata and bow, these female Samurai are versatile cavalry units who excel in melee. Do not doubt the courage of a woman... Tetsubo Warrior Monk Hero  armed with iron-studded clubs, these Monks are devastating in melee as they bash their way through their foes. 10 new naval units and 3 new naval special abilities (Banzai!, Whistling Arrows and Rally) 4 new agent types with their own unique skill trees: The Shirabyoshi uses seduction to convince her target to join her familys cause, and to distract enemy armies. She is also able to entertain the nobles of friendly towns in order to boost their growth and entertain friendly generals in the field, which increases their loyalty to the family and counteracts the efforts of enemy agents attempting to bribe or seduce them into changing sides. The Junsatsushi can request the allegiance of neutral and enemy castle towns, along with any forces garrisoned there. He ensures loyalty and obedience from friendly generals, increases income by preventing corruption, and keeps your castle towns and armies safe from enemy subterfuge when stationed there. He can also pay off rival agents. The Monomi acts as an assassin, spy, saboteur and scout. He can establish spy networks within your castle towns, which increases the chances of discovering any rival agents and armies that may be hiding within a province. The Sou can inspire a friendly army or pacify an angry populace with his enlightened rhetoric. Likewise, he can demoralize an enemy force, reduce the chances of successful bribery, indoctrinate enemy agents and cause them to retire, or incite an enemy population to revolt. This dlc pack also adds a new historical battle of Anegawa (1570). The Hattori Clan Pack includes all four unlocks previously only available in the Total War: SHOGUN 2 Limited Edition. The Hattori clan are masters of the Iga-ryu ninjutsu - a unique collection of martial skills and guerrilla techniques. This additional in-game faction is available for use in single or multiplayer Campaign modes and Custom and Multiplayer Battles. It includes the most powerful battlefield ninja units. The Battle of Nagashino (historical scenario) saw an alliance between the Oda and Tokugawa clans clashing against the legendary Takeda clan in 1575. Takeda was ultimately defeated but, as in all Total War battles, victory lies in your hands and by playing one of these three factions you can repeat history... or even rewrite it! Special armour for your avatar  this complete set of armour will make your Generals avatar stand out on the battlefield and will reward you with the Bad Omen retainer that affects morale to enemy ashigaru (foot soldier) units, giving you a competitive advantage online. Bank account of XP for your avatar  start your Generals avatar at a higher level, with instant access to one upgrade point to spend on special skills or traits. Adds blood and gore visual effects as well as the appropriate sound effects: The Total War: SHOGUN 2 Blood Pack features new visual effects during real time battles: A demo became available on Steam on 22 February.[15] The demo covers the campaign tutorial, the historical Battle of Sekigahara and the full game encyclopedia. You are able to take control of the Chosokabe Clan by playing the tutorial, focused on the Shikoku island and surrounding provinces. The standalone expansion to Total War: Shogun 2 titled Fall of the Samurai was released on 23 March, 2012. It is set during the events leading up to and including the Meiji Restoration, when the threat of Western powers forced Japan's government to modernize and eventually abolish its traditional Samurai-based feudal system. Since the Fall of the Samurai expansion is in a period later than previous Total War games, there are new features not seen in previous games. For the first time, railroads make an appearance in the game, allowing for much faster troop movement on the campaign map. The Gatling gun, one of the first machine-guns developed, also appears in the game. Artillery units and ships can now bombard enemy units directly on the campaign map. Likewise, coastal guns can now be built to counter such bombardment. Since ships in the expansion are now steam-powered, there are significant changes in naval warfare and tactics from previous games. The gameplay, like all the total war games before it, has the elements of building, exploration, negotiation as well as attack. Fall of the Samurai includes the following features: Total War: Shogun 2 received critical acclaim. It received a rating of 90% from Metacritic and 89.33% from GameRankings. GameSpot reviewer Daniel Shannon has called it the "best Total War yet".[20] Alan Blair (Lead Campaign programmer), Kevin McDowell (Lead Artist) and Scott Pitkethley (Lead Battle programmer) won GAME BAFTA Award for Total War:Shogun 2 for best strategy game.
