Francesco Capuano Di Manfredonia (flourished 15th century) was an Italian astronomer. He was a published professor of astronomy at Padua, Republic of Venice, then later became a bishop. At some point he became known as Johannes Baptista Capuanus si Pontinus, de Manfredonia.[1] He wrote an influential commentary on the work Tractatus de Sphaera by Johannes de Sacrobosco.[2] This commentary was reprinted six times, up through 1531.[1] Francesco died around 1490.[3] On Giovanni Battista Riccioli's 17th century lunar map, a crater feature was named Capuanus after the astronomer. This feature was later changed to Ramsden crater.[4] A crater to the east-southeast of Ramsden was later named Capuanus crater for him, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1935.[5]
