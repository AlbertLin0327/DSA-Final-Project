 Elevation  1,544 metres (5,066ft) Waknaghat is a small town in Solan district in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh which falls on the way to Shimla, India from Kalka, India. It is located on National Highway 22. Waknaghat is around 20 km from Shimla and 23 km from Solan. This small colony has developed considerably in the last few years because of Jaypee University of Information Technology, M/S Bhargavi Enterprises and bahra university. Other nearby towns, namely Shoghi and Kandaghat becoming too far to commute conveniently from everyday, this place is the primary choice of off-campus boarding for the students of the university. However, many faculty members of the University reside in Shoghi and Kandaghat.
