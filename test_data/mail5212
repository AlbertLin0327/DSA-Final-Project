Mount Mary Austin is a mountain east of the Sierra Crest and west of Independence, California. It is named in honor of Mary Hunter Austin,[2] the author of The Land of Little Rain, who lived in Independence. The mountain is in the John Muir Wilderness. Access is limited because the area is considered habitat for the Sierra Nevada Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis sierrae) which is endangered. Permits are issued from December 15 to July 1.[3]
