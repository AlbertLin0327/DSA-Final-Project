Angel is the 12th album by The Ohio Players, and the 6th album recorded for Mercury. The band grew from seven to eight members with the addition of Clarence "Chet" Willis on rhythm guitar. Three singles were released in support of the album: "Body Vibes," "O-H-I-O" and "Merry Go Round". "O-H-I-O" would prove to be a concert favorite, with the band and crowd chanting in unison the letters.
