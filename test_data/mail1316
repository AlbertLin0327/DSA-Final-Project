Lanthanite is a radioactive mineral, a carbonate of the rare earth elements lanthanum, cerium and neodymium with formula: (La,Ce,Nd)2(CO3)38(H2O). It is officially known as three separate minerals lanthanite-Ce, lanthanite-La and lanthanite-Nd based on the dominant rare earth element. Some samples of the mineral may also contain dysprosium. It is a secondary mineral formed by the weathering of other minerals and occurs as scales or tabular crystals. Originally identified at Bastns, Sweden, it has subsequently been found in Wales, Quebec and Vermont. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
