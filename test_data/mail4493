Nathaniel Springer Berry (September 1, 1796  April 27, 1894) was an American tanner from Hebron, New Hampshire. He served New Hampshire in both houses of the state legislature and as Governor for two terms. He was born in 1796 in Bath, Maine. During the American Civil War, he played a vital role in state recruitment levels. In 1862, he attended the Loyal War Governors' Conference in Altoona, Pennsylvania, which ultimately backed Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and the Union war effort. He died at the age of 97 years in 1894 in Bristol, New Hampshire.
