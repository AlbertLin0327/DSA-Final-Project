Sprva eleznin dopravn cesty (English: Railway Infrastructure Administration) is the national railway infrastructure manager in the Czech Republic. Its main customers include passenger train operator esk drhy and its cargo subsidiary D Cargo. SDC was founded with the restructuring of D from 1 January 2002, but until 2008 much of the operations, maintenance and renewals was contracted back to D.[2] SDC manage 9,478 km of tracks in Czech Republic[3] - all main lines and almost all regional lines (except Nov Bystice - Obrata narrow gauge line and umperk - Kouty nad Desnou line). In August 2010, SDC was ordered to stop work on all infrastructure projects, as part of broader government austerity measures[4], but in September 2010 works were revieved for all projects, whose contractors agreed to grant discount against tender price.[5] In December 2010 the Minister of Transportation Vt Brta proposed bringing it into a holding company alongside D to "make subsidies more transparent".[6] In 2010 the revenues from rail network usage reached only CZK 4.3 billion, not even sufficient to cover personal expenses amounting to CZK 4.6 billion.[1] The key budget items allowing management and repairs of the rail network were therefore subsidies from the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure (CZK 8.2 billion) and from the state budget (CZK 1.8 billion).[1] Moreover, SDC received CZK 15 billion for modernization of the rail network.[1] In 2012, SDC started its largest ever infrastructure project; a new railway line between Plzen and Rokycany, expected to cost 7.53bn CZK (with 85% funding from the EU). It is expected to be completed in Spring 2015. The new railway would be 141 km long, with a 415 km twin-bore tunnel.[7]
