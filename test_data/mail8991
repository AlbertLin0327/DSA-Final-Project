"Limit to Your Love" is a single by British musician James Blake, released on his self-titled debut album. It is a cover version of a song by Canadian musician Feist, originally appearing on her 2007 album The Reminder, and written by Leslie Feist and Gonzales (Jason Charles Beck). The James Blake single was released in the United Kingdom on 25 November 2010,[1] where it debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 47 and peaked at number 39.[2] Evanthia Patsiaoura of Shout 4 Music Blog gave the song a positive review stating: This first exposure of Blakes vocal abilities in foreground performance leaves one speechless. His voice is more than astonishing, as equipped with a unique timbre of absolutely minimal deepness. While stimulating a series of pictured feelings, this single stresses its performers expressive capacity, which is impressive enough for a 21-year-old artist. The minimalist elements of this cover are not restricted in vocal expression, as they are also wisely given by piano chords and synth echo-like effects; this way the song is provided with a form of call-and-response between voice and instrumental background throughout. Surprisingly enough, the significant pause part does not seem awkward at all, but rather serves as a moment of reflection on what was previously said; it even more lets the listener to be kinda lost in their on-going thoughtful feelings.8/10 stars.[3] "Limit to Your Love" first debuted on the UK Singles Chart on 12 December 2010 at number 47[2]; before falling 10 places to number 57 the following week. On its third week in the chart, the single fell a further 27 places to number 84; climbing 3 places the following week. Having fallen out of the top 100, "Limit to Your Love" re-entered the charts at number 39 on 9 January 2011; following Blake's runner-up position in the Sound of 2011 poll. The single spent one week in the Top 40 before falling to number 47 on its sixth week in the chart[2]. The single also debuted on various charts across Europe during January 2011, including on the Dutch Top 40, where it debuted at number 18 on 8 January; before climbing to a peak of number 7 the following week[4]. "Limit to Your Love" also reached peaks of number 5 and number 2 in Belgium on the Flanders Tip and Wallonia Tip charts respectively[5][6]. On 24 December 2010, the single debuted at number 3; spending a total of five consecutive weeks within the country's top 40[7].
