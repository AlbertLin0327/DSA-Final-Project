Pasadena, California (Distance Learning), California Pacific Oaks College is located in Pasadena, California, United States. Pacific Oaks College is a higher education institution that has full & part-time undergraduate and graduate students throughout Pacific Oaks' California campuses as well as online.

Founded more than 60 years ago in 1959 by a small group of Quaker families.[citation needed] The main campus is located in Pasadena, California. In addition to its main campus in Pasadena, Pacific Oaks offers classes at instructional sites throughout the state of California. These include: Chico, Sacramento, Salinas, and Santa Cruz.
