The Song Remains Insane[1] is the tenth album by Dread Zeppelin, released in 1996. It is a double live album from their tour recorded in Paris, Tokyo Sydney, Copenhagen and Las Vegas. (See 1996 in music) Dread Zeppelin is known for their humorous stage antics, with strange masks, hypnotic dances, hilarious choreography, and funny band interaction between songs mostly by the bigger than life persona of Tortelvis into the King (he IS the King). Unfortunately the album does not reflect all of this, and the sound quality is dubious by moment (but good for a live album). This album is of great value to fans that assisted to live performances. To be noted an un-documented 13th track Radio Montage[2] on the second CD created with radio extracts (English and Japanese) mentioning Dread Zeppelin, the voice of Tortelvis (interviews real or fake) with its usual tirades presenting the band members and live music with voices of said members from shows. The CD insert has texts from Paul Elliot (Sounds UK), Jah Paul Jo (Halvallah 1996), and a quote from Frank Zappa Art is about making something out of nothing and selling it. Disc one  titled "The Song Remains Insane" Disc two  titled "The 'Live On Strawberry Cheesecake' Sessions"
