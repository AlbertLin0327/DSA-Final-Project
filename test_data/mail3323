black belt in Taekwondo Jung Chan-Sung (born March 17, 1987), often anglicised to Chan-Sung Jung, is a South Korean mixed martial artist and kickboxer currently competing in the Ultimate Fighting Championships. His nickname "The Korean Zombie" comes from his ability to continue to move forward and fight aggressively, even after taking heavy blows. He made his professional debut in June 2007 and in December the same year he won a lightweight tournament arranged by Pancrase Korea. In 2008 he won both his fights for Japanese promotion DEEP. He then entered the 2009 Sengoku Featherweight Grand-Prix where he won his first-round fight but ended up getting eliminated from the tournament by the eventual winner Masanori Kanehara. Jung Chan-Sung is currently ranked #4 by ESPN and #10 by Fight Matrix in the featherweight division. Born in Pohang, South Korea in 1987, Jung moved to Nam Yang Ju, a satellite city of Seoul when he was in his mid teens. Due to his slight stature and his rural birthplace, he was bullied constantly by his classmates. Jung got into many fights because of the bullying and usually lost. When his aunt could no longer stand to see Jung's predicament, she took him to a nearby Hapkido gym. Jung trained in Hapkido before joining a kickboxing-gym at age 18.[3] In June 2007, he won a Sambo tournament arranged by the Korean Sambo Association, and in December of the same year, he won the lightweight division of the Pancrase Korea Neo-Blood Tournament after defeating fellow South Koreans Yoo In Seok and Lee Hyung Geol.[1][3] In May 2008, he participated in and won KOREA-FC's 8-man MMA tournament in the 65kg division.[3] On August 16, 2008, he defeated Michihiro Omigawa at Deep - Gladiator by unanimous decision. His next fight was against Fanjin Son at Deep - 39 Impact where he won by KO in 17 seconds.[1] Jung then entered the 2009 Sengoku Featherweight Grand-Prix and was matched up with Shintaro Ishiwatari in his first-round fight at Sengoku 7.[4] After dropping Ishiwatari once in stand-up striking, Jung hit Ishiwatari with a right hand forcing him to give up his back. From there Jung sunk in a rear naked choke forcing Ishiwatari to submit at 4:29 of the first round.[5] In his second-round fight at Sengoku 8 on May 2, 2009, he lost via unanimous decision to Masanori Kanehara officially eliminating him from the tournament.[6] The decision was considered questionable by the english commentators and many fans (especially given Sengoku's history of biased decisions against Korean fighters), who felt that Jung had done enough to deserve the decision. On June 7, 2009, it was announced Jung would face American Matt Jaggers at Sengoku 9 in a reserve bout for the tournament with the winner stepping in as a replacement should some of the remaining fighters be unable to continue.[7] Jung ended up winning the fight by triangle choke submission at 1:25 of the second round, but was not required to step in as a replacement.[8] Chan Sung Jung then signed with World Extreme Cagefighting.[9] He made his American and WEC debut against Leonard Garcia (who replaced injured opponent Cub Swanson) on April 24, 2010 at WEC 48[10] losing by an extremely controversial split decision. Many MMA publications and fans (including many in the Sacramento home crowd) opposed the decision, which has led again to questions about the accuracy of the fight judging.[11][12] However, the bout was declared the Fight of the Night, along side with Joe Rogan's thought of the bout being Fight of the Decade. Jung next faced George Roop on September 30, 2010 at WEC 51.[13] He lost the fight via knockout due to a head kick in the second round, which resulted in Jung's first knockout in his MMA career and second consecutive loss. Jung was expected to face Rani Yahya on January 22, 2011 at UFC Fight Night 23.[14] However, Jung was forced from the card with an injury.[15] A rematch with Garcia was scheduled for March 26, 2011 at UFC Fight Night 24, after Jung stepped in to replace an injured Nam Phan.[16] Jung was able to avenge the original loss after submitting Garcia with a twister in the final second of the second round. This was the first time in the history of the UFC that a twister submission ended a bout and the win earned Jung his first Submission of the Night bonus. This was later awarded for the Submission of the Year by the World MMA Awards.[17] In his post-fight interview, Jung stated he learned the move by watching Eddie Bravo videos on YouTube.[17] Jung faced Mark Hominick on December 10, 2011 at UFC 140. Jung won the bout via KO at 0:07 of the first round,[18] Jung's victory over Mark Hominick earned him Knockout of the Night honors. The victory also earned Jung much praise in his native South Korea, appearing on news broadcasts on the country's major national television channels (such as KBS). Jung faced Dustin Poirier on May 15, 2012 at UFC on Fuel TV: Korean Zombie vs. Poirier.[19] Jung finished Poirier via D'Arce choke in the fourth round after controlling the action for the majority of the bout. The performance earned Jung Submission of the Night and both partipants Fight of the Night honors.
