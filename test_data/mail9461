Development Ratings is a UK Community Interest Company founded in 2006 that provides ratings of charities. The organisation's goal is to increase the flow of funds to developing countries by finding the best solutions to fight poverty and increasing transparency about charitable organisations. Development Ratings rates charities based on their track record and ability to make a development impact.
