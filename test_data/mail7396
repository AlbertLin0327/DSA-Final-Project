Antonio Ottoboni (16461710) was a Neapolitan general and the father of Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni.[1][2] Prince Antonio Ottoboni, a general of the papal army, came to Naples in 1694. Like his son, Cardinal Ottoboni, Prince Antonio was an enthusiastic patron of music. He supplied the libretto for Alessandro Scarlatti's second smaller setting of La Giuditta in 1697, and texts for many cantatas. Before 1707, probably in 1703 or 1704, he appointed Scarlatti his maestro di cappella.[3]
