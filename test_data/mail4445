A freebord is a type of specialist skateboard designed to closely simulate the behavior of a snowboard. They have 6 wheels - two spring locked castor wheels on the central axis, and four slightly raised conventional wheels. The central wheels are able to turn freely in all directions, which allows the Freebord to slide laterally as long as no other wheel touches the ground. By exerting some pressure on the edge wheels, the Freeborder is able to control the board. The central wheels thus mimic the deck of the snowboard, while the outer wheels mimic the two steel edges.[1] Older Alpha series decks featured kicktails and were of a longer length (100cm and 112cm). These have now been completely replaced by the newer models which are much lighter and more maneuverable. Whilst this activity is a boardsport and so the use of "freeboard" is legitimate, it has to be taken into account that the unique trucks which are ultimately what allow the rider to use the board in the way it is used, are patented. The patent is property of Freebord Mfg. and therefore only they can produce and sell the trucks. Furthermore the use of "free" is not a generically descriptive name for type of terrain or use of the board in the same way "wind" or "snow" is. Surfing without foot straps has been referred to as freeboarding. Therefore it could be seen as proper to use the term "freebording". "Freeride" and "freestyle" both refer to the way in which a freebord is used. The term "freeride" refers to plain riding with little or no tricks, usually consisting of carving and sliding. Another name for freeride can be "Downhill". A bigger board is used for downhill freebording or freeriding as this gives you better balance allowing you to go faster. The term "freestyle" as used in other boardsports such as skateboarding means doing tricks like skating off ramps, grinding rails, jumping, etc. Smaller boards are usually used for freestyle as not only will they be lighter making them easier to jump with, but the rider can more easily push his feet outwards so as to make sure that his feet stay in the bindings.
