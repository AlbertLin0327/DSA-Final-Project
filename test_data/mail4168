Orangeville District Secondary School is located at 22 Faulkner Street in Orangeville, Ontario, Canada, and is the oldest secondary school in the town. It was built in its current state after the old high school (originally built in 1884) burned down in 1948.[1] Currently, grades 9 through 12 are housed at O.D.S.S. Approximately 1800 students attend the school. Famous graduates include Degrassi: The Next Generation actor Ryan Cooley; WWE stars Adam Copeland and Jason Reso, better known as Edge and Christian; and current mayor Rob Adams.
