Pseudopostega truncata is a moth of the Opostegidae family. It is only known from central Brazil. The length of the forewings is about 3.8 mm. Adults are mostly white with almost entirely white forewings. Adults have been collected in December and January. The species name is derived from the Latin truncus (cut off) in reference to the truncate apex of the caudal lobe of the male gnathos.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
