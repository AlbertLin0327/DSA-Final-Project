Coordinates: 1609.25S 14621.34W / 16.15417S 146.35567W / -16.15417; -146.35567 Niau is a small atoll in French Polynesia, in the commune of Fakarava (Tuamotu archipelago). This atoll has broad fringing reef and an area of 20km. Niau's lagoon is swampy, hypersaline and entirely enclosed. The narrow strip of land surrounding the lagoon is covered by marsh vegetation. The lagoon area is 33km and it has an unusual green color. The only human settlement on Niau is Tupana, population 136 (as of 2002). The first recorded European to visit Niau was Russian explorer Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen in 1820 on ships Vostok and Mirni. He named this island "Greig". Niau is administratively part of the commune of Fakarava, which consists of the island Fakarava, as well as the atolls of Aratika, Kauehi, Niau, Raraka, Taiaro and Toau. Niau is one of the few locations where has been preserved the original ecosystem Tuamotu tropical moist forest, which here is called - feo.[1] This ecosystem represents a mixed broadleaf forest[2], it has disappeared in practically all other atolls. Forest has been preserved in the central part of the island, it contains several endemic species of plants and animals. The small-sized Tuamotu Kingfisher Todiramphus gambieri lives now exclusively in the Island of Niau. This critically endangered bird disappeared from the Gambier Islands long ago. There is an airfield, Niau Airport, on the northern tip of the atoll (ICAO: NTKN).
