Alan Woodman (born 7 June 1955) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Geelong in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Woodman was a defender from Bannockburn who played mostly as a centre half-back and in the back pocket.[1] He had one of his best games in Geelong's semi final against North Melbourne in 1976, with 23 disposals, but finished on the losing team.[2] In 1978 he appeared in 21 games, the most he would play in a single season.[2] In 1982 and 1983, Woodman won the Hampden Football League's Maskell Medal, while playing with Camperdown. He was the first player to win the award back to back since George Swarbrick in the 1950s, another Geelong footballer.
