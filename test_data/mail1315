Inside Out is a non-profit registered charity that is dedicated to challenging attitudes and changing lives through the medium of queer cinema. The organization supports lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) audiences and filmmakers of all ages, races and abilities through the promotion, production and exhibition of LGBT film. The most high profile presentations are the annual Toronto LGBT Film Festival and Ottawa LGBT Film Festival, which collectively draw over 35 000 patrons a year. Inside Out also maintains a year-round presence with special events, community initiatives, school programs and a bi-monthly screening series at the TIFF Bell Lightbox. The organization's current executive director is Scott Ferguson. A sister festival was launched in Ottawa in 2007, known as the Inside Out Ottawa LGBT Film Festival. First held at Toronto's Euclid Theatre in 1991, Inside Out celebrated its festival with a small community of people who yearned to see film and video created by and about lesbians, gays, bisexuals and trans (LGBT) people. The festival has since expanded to incorporate a variety of programs related to the promotion and development of LGBT film arts in Canada. Currently the largest event of its kind in Canada, the Festival entertains film buffs of all stripes, showcasing the best and most diverse work of interest to LGBT communities. Taking place over 11 days, the Festival draws crowds of 35,000 to screenings, artist talks, panel discussions, installations and parties that highlight more than 200 films and videos from Canada and around the world. Since 2009, RBC Royal Bank has served as the Presenting Sponsor of the Toronto Festival. Since 2007, Inside Out has produced a four-day festival in the Ottawa- Gatineau region. With the support of Presenting Sponsor RBC Royal Bank, the Ottawa Festival showcases the best queer cinema from Canada and around the world. The event has received a warm welcome from the queer community in the region, building partnerships with local businesses and LGBT organizations and experiencing healthy growth in attendance each year with the 2011 Festival attracting more than 3,500 attendees to 13 film programs and parties. In 1998, with the support of Charles Street Video, Inside Out initiated the Queer Video Mentorship Project to provide opportunities for youth to learn video production in a supportive atmosphere. Queer youth under the age of 25 are mentored through the process of making their first videos, from storyboarding and shooting to post-production and editing. In celebration of the Festival's 20th Anniversary in 2010, Inside Out expanded it into a multi-generational program bringing together LGBT youth and seniors over the age of 55. To date, close to 100 new artists have created work through the Project. The works are screened at the festival and many go on to play at festivals around the globe. Each year, the works are compiled and distributed free to schools and community organizations. In 2001, Inside Out launched the inaugural John Bailey Film and Video Completion Fund. Named in recognition of the contribution of a longtime Inside Out supporter and advisory board member, the fund awards grants ranging from $500 to $2,000 to Canadian filmmakers with work in the final stages of production. Inaugurated in 2002, this annual $5,000 cash scholarship assists a Canadian student who identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans and who wishes to pursue post-secondary studies in the field of film or video. The first scholarship was awarded in September 2002 to Adam Garnet Jones from Vancouver. Subsequent recipients are Mary Fogarty, Christopher Sanchez, Jung Kim, Cam Matamoros, Jo Simalaya Alcampo, Rachel Smyth and Jordan Tannahill. The Inside Out Arts Endowment Fund was established in December 2001 through the Ontario Arts Foundation to provide a stable base of funding for Inside Out in the future. The Fund was created thanks to a generous founding gift from Mark Bonham of $200,000, and it is currently valued at close to $300,000. Supporters of Inside Out can make tax-deductible donations specifically to the Endowment Fund. Inside Out maintains its year-round presence through a series of film screenings held at the TIFF Bell Lightbox. The series selects the best LGBT films from the international festival circuit, bringing films to new audiences and supporting the work and development of emerging filmmakers.
