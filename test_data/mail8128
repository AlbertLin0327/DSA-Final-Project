Chakacha is a traditional music and dance style (a ngoma) of the Swahili people of coastal Kenya and Tanzania, originally associated to weddings and performed and watched by women. In the late 20th century, musical groups such as Mombasa Roots, Safari Sound Band and Them Mushrooms have adapted this style to afropop music. The hip-swaying dance movements of Chakacha are bear some resemblance with both Congolese soukous dances and Middle Eastern belly dances.
