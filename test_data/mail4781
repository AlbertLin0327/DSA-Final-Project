Sdertlje Syd (Sdertlje South) is a major, but not the most centrally located, railway station in Sdertlje, Sweden. It is located on top of the 2km long Igelsta Bridge. Regional and long distance trains for destinations such as Stockholm, Gteborg, Malm, Copenhagen, Oslo, Linkping and Eskilstuna stop at the station. The local SdertljeStockholm commuter train, however, goes from central Sdertlje, and that station has by far more passengers than Sdertlje Syd. The SL monthly ticket is not valid on regional trains, only local SL trains. There are also local SL trains central SdertljeGnesta with relatively sparse frequency, stopping at Sdertlje Syd, under the Igelsta Bridge with escalator link. To get from Sdertlje Syd to central Sdertlje, the local train or the local bus can be used. Tickets for both are only sold by a machine at the bus stop, not by the driver, and not in the chocolate/newspaper kiosk which is located in the station.
