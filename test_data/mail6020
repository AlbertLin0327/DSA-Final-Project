Shooting at the Moon is the second solo album of Kevin Ayers. In early 1970, Ayers assembled a band he called The Whole World to tour his debut LP Joy of a Toy that included, a young Mike Oldfield, David Bedford, Lol Coxhill, Mick Fincher, the folk singer Bridget St. John and Robert Wyatt. After a UK tour, Ayers took the Whole World into the studio to cut an LP, produced, like his debut, with Peter Jenner. The line-up produced a heady mixture of ideas and experimentation with two distinctive styles emerging; carefree ballads like Clarence In Wonderland and May I? abutted the avant garde experimentation of songs like Reinhardt and Geraldine and Underwater. The album has since become a best seller in Ayers' catalogue. Although The Whole World disbanded shortly after the release, the nucleus of the group would contribute to Ayers next LP, Whatevershebringswesing. Ayers released a single of exclusive material at the time "Butterfly Dance" coupled with "Puis Je?" (a French language version of May I?) Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, who were big fans of Ayers, referred to 'Shooting At The Moon' as "the best album ever made" in the sleeve notes to their 1994 album 'Tatay'.
