Asotra is the site of world's second Brahma Temple built by late Brahmarshi Sant Khetaram ji Maharaj. The first being Pushkar. Asotra is a village located in Barmer district of Rajasthan, near the city of Balotra which is at a distance of 10km. Pachpadra is 17km to the north, Umarlai is 17km to the north-east and Meli is 18km to the east of Asotra. Balotra Junction Railway Station is the nearest railhead. Jodhpur Airport at a distance of 100km, serves Asotra. Lord Brahma is the prominent lord god of the Hindu triad. The other two are Vishnu and Mahesh. Brahma is the lord of creation. There is one temple of Brahma at Pushkar. The other is here. The yellow (golden stone) of Jaisalmer has been used in the construction of main entrance hall. The rest of the temple is made of Jodhpur Stone (Chhitar Stone). The idol of Shri Brahma ji is made of Marble. The carving work however is unique. The foundation of the temple was laid on 20 April 1961 but the deity was enthroned on 6 May 1984. The chief deity is lord Brahma, his consort Gayatri's idol is also by the side of the chief deity. The idol is indeed unique piece of sculptural elegance. There are idols of various vedic sages Maharishi Uddalak, Maharishi Vashishta, Maharishi Kashyap, Maharishi Gautam, Maharishi Pippalada, Maharishi Parashara and Maharishi Bhardwaj. Rajpurohit brahmins trace their vedic lineage from these sages. The temple has been built mainly by the Rajpurohit community. A big condoned off place is there for birds to pick up grain. Every day 200 Kilogram of grain is fed to birds. The vast lodge can house hundreds of visitors in its 102 rooms and 11 halls. Charges are very nominal. The present Mahant (Manager priest) Sant Tulsaram ji Maharaj is doing a commendable job in propagating the message of love and peace along with heading various programs for social welfare. An education institution, in the name of Sant Khetaram ji Maharaj is being run. A higher secondary school is also proposed. Free charitable preparation of food is performed every day which is served to visitors and devotees much like the langar pratha common among Sikhs. A well managed kine house (gaushala) houses 350 cows. Gau-seva has as a prime importance in the vedic sanatana dharma. Late Sant Khetaramji/Kheteshwar ji Maharaj was a true saint by means of dharma and karma. He was a divine soul who had followers cutting across all castes and creeds. He revitalized the importance of spiritual means to achieve self-realization and emphasizing humanity above all other man made barriers like casteism etc. The divine being laid down his fleshy tebernacle on May 6, 1984 and left for heavenly abode after inaugurating the Lord Brahma Temple on May 5, 1984 i.e. after establishing the idol of Brahmaji. His disciples and his community members- Rajpurohits overwhelmed with emotions then built a vast and beautiful temple dedicated to the late saint in the near vicinity of the Brahma mandir housing a lifesize idol of the saint. Makrana marble has been used for erecting the cenotaph of Sant Shri Kheteshwar ji Maharaj. The place has now developed as a major tourist attraction of the region pulling thousands of tourists and devotees each year. Every year on 5th day of the bright half of Vaisakh month (May) the Pran-Prathishta ceremony is commemorated. On the next day, the death anniversary of Sant Kheteshwar ji Maharaj (the founder of the temple) is observed. Other major festivals celebrated here are - Mahashivratri and Guru Poornima. netaram&dudaramji asotra vera_magra pipliya nada ph#9414907029 9460014397 Coordinates: 2546N 7218E / 25.767N 72.3E / 25.767; 72.3
