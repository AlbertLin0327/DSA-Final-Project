The National Technical Library (Nrodn Technick Knihovna or "NTK" in Czech) is located at Technick 6 in Prague 6 and also houses the Municipal Library. The former site of the National Technical Library was the Klementinum, from which all books and materials were moved to the new library after completion of construction. The building was designed by architects Roman Brychta, Adam Hal, Ondej Hofmeister and Petr Leek of Projektil Architekti after winning first prize in an architectural competition held in 2000.[1] Building construction started in 2006 and was completed in January 2009. The library opened to the public on 9 September 2009 and hosts the most extensive collection of Czech and foreign documents in the field of technology and applied natural and social sciences related to technology in the Czech Republic.[2] Its user-friendly design philosophy has been described as a "hi-tech living room for students" by the institution's Director Martin Svoboda.[3] National Technical Library in Prague (NTK) - a global view.

The card-operated information kiosks scattered throughout the building enable printing and catalogue searching. The atrium is naturally lit through the skylight. Thematic directory stenciled on the bare concrete column. Almost all surfaces throughout the building are exposed concrete. Graphic design follows the "technical schoolbook" concept. Bold-coloured flooring and movable furniture lend openness and friendliness to the space. Coordinates: 500614N 142326E / 50.10389N 14.39056E / 50.10389; 14.39056
