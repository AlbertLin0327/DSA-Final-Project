Conus solidus G. B. Sowerby II, 1841 Conus textile var. sulcata G. B. Sowerby II, 1834 Conus retifer is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.[1] Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of "stinging" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
