Frederick (Ferry) II of Vaudmont (c.1428  31 August 1470), also known as Frederick II of Lorraine, was Count of Vaudmont and Lord of Joinville from 1458 to 1470. He was son of Antoine of Lorraine, Count of Vaudmont and Lord of Joinville and Marie, Countess of Aumale and Baroness of Elbeuf. He is sometimes numbered Frederick V by continuity with the Dukes of Lorraine. In 1445, he married his cousin Yolande of Anjou (14281483), daughter of Ren I of Anjou, (King of Naples, Duke of Anjou, of Bar and of Lorraine, Count of Provence), and of Isabelle, Duchess of Lorraine. This marriage put an end to the litigation which existed between the fathers of the bride and groom, in connection with the succession of the Duchy of Lorraine. They had six children: In 1453 his father-in-law honoured him with the command of the troops that he sent to the Dauphin Louis to help him to fight the Duke of Savoy. In 1456 Ren entrusted the government of the Duchy of Bar to Frederick, and in 1459 granted him the honorary title of Lieutenant-General of Sicily.
