 Star Wars Legacy: Indomitable is a two-part story arc between issues 20 & 21 of The Star Wars: Legacy series of comic books written by John Ostrander. The first issue was published on 27 February 2008 by Dark Horse Comics. The story is set in the Star Wars galaxy 137 years after the Battle of Yavin in the film Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. This is a continuing side-story of the last of the Galactic Alliance's armed forces trying to survive in the Sith dominated New Galactic Empire by acquiring a new and powerful Star Destroyer from the massive shipyards of the Mon Calamari's homeworld of Dac which is under Imperial control. Issue 20 - Part 1: For seven years, outlaw Admiral Gar Stazi has led the remains of the Galactic Alliance in hit-and-run operations against the Sith-led Empire. When word reaches him of a nearly completed, top-secret Imperial construction, he gambles his entire fleet to seize the project and turn the tide of war against the Sith! Issue 21 - Part 2: The Sith have lured outlaw Admiral Gar Stazi into a trap to destroy the Alliance once and for all. Yet Stazi is no fool-he may have agreed to play the Sith's game, but not with the cards they expect! Meanwhile, forces loyal to the deposed Emperor Roan Fel wait on the sidelines. Are they here to help, to hurt, or simply make off with whatever's left when the dust settles? Issue 22: (Sith) Emperor Krayt is displeased, and the price of betrayal will be exacted from an entire race, their suffering rippling to the edges of the Outer Rim. Yet his wrath will not stop there, as even among his own ranks failure will be dealt with cruelly and with lasting results. Old allegiances will be tested, and new bonds will be formed through pain and anger. This is first actions of the remains of the Galactic Alliance's remaining forces that escaped the New Galactic Empire's control. Show casing key moments that lead to the GA's dissolve as its fleet on tipping point between rebel resistance and becoming just another pirate fleet.
