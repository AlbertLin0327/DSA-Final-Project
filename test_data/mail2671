A plebiscite to ratify the Constitution of Ireland was held on the same day. The newly elected 138 members of the 9th Dil assembled at Leinster House on 21 July 1937 when the new President of the Executive Council and Executive Council of the Irish Free State were appointed. The general election took place in 34 parliamentary constituencies throughout the Irish Free State for 138 seats in the lower house of parliament, Dil ireann. For this election the number of seats in the Dil was reduced by 15 from 153 to 138 seats.
