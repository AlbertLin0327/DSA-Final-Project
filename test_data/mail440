Faith Rockefeller Model (May 30, 1909  July 2, 1960) was a daughter of Percy Avery Rockefeller (18781934) and granddaughter of Standard Oil co-founder William Rockefeller (18411922). Model was born and died in the city of Greenwich, Connecticut. She married a Belgian, Jean Model, on May 7, 1941 and the couple had three children: Robert, Jeanette, and Richard. The Faith Rockefeller Model Center for the Arts at Elon University in Elon, North Carolina was named for her in 1994 by her son and 1967 Elon alumnus, Robert Model. The town of Faith, South Dakota is rumored to have been named for her as well because of her father's investment in the railroad responsible for the town's founding.
