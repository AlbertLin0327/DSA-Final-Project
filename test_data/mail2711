William Paul Shao (born March 18, 1973) is a features writer based in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. He is the author of the book, Miaka 2000 ya Ukristo: Historia Iliyopotoshwa. He worked at media house New Habari Corporation but resigned when pay became erratic and the working conditions deteriorated badly.[1] Shao is at Business Timess Majira as of 2010.[1] Shao was born in the village of Mrimbo Uuwo situated in Moshi Rural District, Kilimanjaro Region. His parents, Paul Israel and Grace Shao, were born of the Chagga tribe, which is the largest in the region of Kilimanjaro. Enrolled in Uuwo Primary School and, later, Secondary School at Marangu Secondary School. After completing high school education at the Sangu High School in Mbeya region, Shao joined various colleges, including school of journalism in Dar es Salaam. He is among those few who do not believe that Osama bin Laden was a mastermind behind September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. Shao argues why did it have to be on September 11? Is it a mere coincidence that the twin towers of the WTC formed number 11 while they were still standing? Is it a mere coincidence that the first plane to hit the towers was Flight 11? Was it mere coincidence that until Tuesday September 11, 2001, eleven years had passed since George W. Bush addressed the US parliament on Tuesday September 11, 1990 where he talked about the Gulf war and New World Order (a US ploy to dominate the World)? Was it mere coincidence that the construction of the Pentagon (one of the victims of the attack) begun on Thursday September 11, 1941? "We need to rethink the 9/11 attacks. We should not take things at face value," he wrote.[2] In his book, Miaka 2000 ya Ukristo: Historia Iliyopotoshwa[3] (in English meaning 2000 Years of Christianity: A Distorted History), ISBN 9987-8910-6-3, Shao do not believe that Jesus Christ was born on December 25.
