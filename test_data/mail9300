Frank Schuchart served in the United States Army during World War I. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions on August 30, 1918 and November 8, 1918, the latter of which took place during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. His award citation reads: The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Private Frank Schuchart (ASN: 2057101), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in action while serving with Company L, 128th Infantry Regiment, 32d Division, A.E.F., near Juvigny, France, 30 August 1918, and in the Argonne Forest, France, 8 November 1918. During the attack near Juvigny, Private Schuchart, while acting as runner, repeatedly exposed himself to severe enemy artillery and machine-gun fire. After the attack he voluntarily joined in the work of clearing the field of wounded under heavy enemy fire. On 8 November while carrying an important message he was severely wounded in the left leg. He stopped in a shell hole, dressed the wound himself, proceeded to deliver the message and did not report for treatment. Schuchart was born in Liberty, Wisconsin[disambiguation needed]. His home of record was Belmont, Wisconsin.[1]
