Highway 162 shield Provincial highways in Nova Scotia Map of first 200 coordinates from Bing Highway 162 is a two-lane controlled access highway on Boularderie Island in Nova Scotia, Canada. Highway 162 was constructed in the late 1970s to link Highway 105 in Bras d'Or to the now-closed Prince Mine at Point Aconi. In the early 1990s the highway was extended another 2 kilometres to terminate at the Point Aconi Generating Station. The highway is 7 kilometres (4.3mi) long. There are no interchanges along the highway.
