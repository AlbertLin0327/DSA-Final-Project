Taup (before 2008 styled as 'Taupo' with no macron) is a New Zealand Parliamentary electorate returning one Member of Parliament to the New Zealand House of Representatives. The current MP for Taup is Louise Upston of the National Party. She has held this position since 2008. The current Taup seat was created ahead of the introduction to Mixed Member Proportional voting in 1996. It is a merger of the old marginal seat of Tongariro with the western half of the safe National seat of Waikaremoana. It, and all its descendents are centred around Taup district and its main towns of Taup, Turangi and Mangakino, with the South Waikato District towns of Tokoroa, Tirau and Putaruru. Before 2008, the electorate pulled south to take in the northern and western parts of Ruapehu District (now annexed by Rangitkei), namely Taumarunui, Raetihi and Ohakune. With the sweeping changes wrought by the boundary review conducted after the 2006 census, low population growth in the south-central North Island coupled with high population growth in and around Auckland has meant Cambridge moved out of the now defunct seat of Piako and into Taup. Taup has twice returned Mark Burton with a majority of around a thousand - in 1996, when Labour's post-1990 fortunes were at their lowest and New Zealand First went on to take a large bite out of their vote; and again in 2005, when National consolidated the centre-right vote, and at the same time won 2,000 more party votes than Burton's Labour party. At the intermediate two MMP elections, Burton was safely returned, thanks in part to a heavy disenchantment with the National Party among its formerly loyal voters. In the political climate in 2008, with the dominance of the National Party in Cambridge, which contributed over ten thousand new voters to the seat, Louise Upston won the seat with a majority of over 6,000. Historically, the name can refer to a seat contested between 1963 and 1981. The seat referred to here was much smaller, because it did not contain the western side of Lake Taup, nor Cambridge, nor the Ruapehu towns. It was as marginal as the seat that would be reclaimed fifteen years later, returning four one-term MPs in succession before its abolition. Unless otherwise stated, all MPs terms began and ended at general elections.  Notes: Green background denotes the winner of the electorate vote.
