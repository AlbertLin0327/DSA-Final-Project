The Lost World of Mr. Hardy is a feature length documentary film about a much loved family fishing tackle business. It was directed by Andy Heathcote and Heike Bachelier. The film tells the story of the disappearing art of the craftsman through the history of the Hardy Brothers, the Rolls Royce of fishing tackle makers. The film includes rediscovered archive movie footage of salmon fishing, filmed by L.R. Hardy and his chauffeur 'Appleby' in the 1920's. The film was produced by Trufflepig Films who successfully self distributed the project giving the film a UK cinema release in 2009/10. The film played well in rural cinemas across England.
