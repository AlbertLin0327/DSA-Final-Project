Plasmodium hermani is a parasite of the genus Plasmodium subgenus Huffia. Like all Plasmodium species P. hermani has both vertebrate and insect hosts. The vertebrate hosts for this parasite are birds. This species was first described in 1975 by Telford and Forrester in a wild turkey[1] The presence and degree of pigmentation vary with maturity of the host cell. Host cell nuclei may be displaced, but are not distorted, except slightly by pressure from the parasite. The asexual stages parasitize all cells in the erythrocyte series. In heavy infections the parasites occur predominantly in erythroblasts and their precursors. Schizonts are rounded with 614 nuclei arranged peripherally as a rosette. Infected cells are often rounded and enlarged. Gametocytes are elongate and slender with irregular margins and are found exclusively in erythrocytes. The pigment is dispersed in black granules throughout the cytoplasm. The host cells may be somewhat distorted in shape by lateral hypertrophy. Plasmodium hermani can be distinguished from Plasmodium durae by Mature gametocytes of P. durae also exhibits the following characteristics which are not found those of P. hermani Plasmodium hermani resembles Plasmodium elongatum in It can be distinguished from Plasmodium elongatum by This species is found in Florida, USA. Note: Cx. nigripalpus appears to be the main natural vector. This species infects knots (Calidris canutus), bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) and turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo). Infection of turkeys causes anaemia, splenomegaly and decreased growth but is not normally fatal.
