KKRZ is a commercial broadcast radio station in Portland, Oregon, also known as Z-100, broadcasts CHR music. What is now KKRZ first signed on May, 7, 1946 as KGW-FM on 95.3 MHz and moved to 100.3 MHz on September 22, 1947. The call letters changed to KQFM on December 1, 1954 and broadcasted a beautiful music format (as "Q-Music") and then in 1978 switched to a pop AOR format under the name "Q-100". The format was changed to oldies on March 16th, 1981 as "Solid Gold FM-100". The station changed to the KKRZ call letters and changed to what is considered a Hot AC format as "The Rose" (hence the KKRZ call letters) in 1983. KKRZ began its current heritage Top 40 format on March 16th, 1984, widely mirroring sister station WHTZ/New York City (down to the name "Z100"). In 1986, the station adopted a more rhythmic leaning format due to the lack of an existing urban-oriented station in Portland. That move would pay off and made KKRZ a dominant success in the ratings in its first 15 years. That was until 1999, when it picked up competition from Adult Contemporary rival KXL-FM, who took advantage of the market's rhythmic void and filled it by becoming KXJM, "Jammin 95.5". This competition between the two would last for nine years, as KXJM (whose playlist favored Hip-Hop/R&B and some Dance product) would overtake KKRZ (who shifted back to a more mainstream direction) in the Portland Arbitrons. After KXJM, who saw their ratings decline by 2007, announced their format flip to Sports Talk as KXTG in May 2008, KKRZ started to lean towards Rhythmic crossovers again, but would end up facing new competition from CBS Radio outlet KVMX, who ironically, dropped their Rhythmic Adult Contemporary format and picked up KXJM's Rhythmic format and intellectual property, including the KXJM calls and "Jammin'" slogan, from Rose City Radio Corporation, the owners of KXTG. KKRZ would later move towards the center again and became a more balanced Top 40/CHR, which helped regain their foothold in the ratings again as well. On April 1, 2009, Clear Channel took over ownership of KXJM from CBS, thus making KKRZ and KXJM sister stations. Both stations retained their respective formats. However, in March 2010, KXJM "relaunched" as "WiLD 107.5" but kept its Rhythmic Top 40 format intact. Despite the fact that both KKRZ and KXJM are under the same ownership, being programmed by the same program director and sharing some of the same music, KKRZ continues to focus on Mainstream Pop/Rock hits. In addition, both stations continue to place among the top 10 in the Portland Arbitrons. Z100 has had several morning shows throughout its history. The Z Morning Zoo started in 1984 (the year Z100 signed on) and lasted until 2000, when it was replaced with Chet & Nicole. They too, were dumped in 2002 for The BuckHead Show. The BuckHead Show had a successful 5 year run until August 15, 2007. In the same week that BuckHead received the Edison's Media Top 30 under 30 Personality award, KKRZ management Brian Bridgman, Tony Coles and Robert Dove began running short, cryptic spots about "T-Man" coming to Portland. On August 31, 2007, BuckHead's morning fill-in host Brooke Fox announced that indeed, "The T-Man Show" was coming to Z100 mornings on Tuesday, September 4, 2007. The T-Man Show was based out of Seattle (at KUBE) and was syndicated in San Francisco (at KYLD). Buck Head can now be heard on WDZH in Detroit, MI. Less than six months after the T-Man show debuted in Portland, it was pulled from KKRZ, for yet undisclosed reasons (presumably due to low ratings). The T-Man could still be heard in Seattle and San Francisco until the show ended in 2009. The replacement morning show is the Arizona-based Johnjay and Rich show. KKRZ-HD2 airs a soft adult contemporary format branded as "Lite and Easy". Bob Pittman (CEO, CC Media Holdings, Inc.) John Hogan (President/CEO, Clear Channel Media and Entertainment, Inc.)
