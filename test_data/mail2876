Tweddle v Atkinson [1861] EWHC QB J57, (1861) 1 B&S 393, 121 ER 762 is an English contract law case concerning the principle of privity of contract and consideration. The grooms father, John Tweddle, agreed with the brides father, William Guy, to pay the groom, William Tweddle, 200. William Guy died, and the estate would not pay. So William Tweddle sued. His suit was not successful as it was held no stranger to the consideration can take advantage of a contract, although made for his benefit. The courts ruled that a promisee cannot bring an action unless the consideration from the promise moved from him. Consideration must move from party entitled to sue upon the contract. No legal entitlement is conferred on third parties to an agreement. Third parties to a contract do not derive any rights from that agreement nor are they subject to any burdens imposed by it.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
