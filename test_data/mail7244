Port Arthur Independent School District is a public school district based in Port Arthur, Texas (USA). The district serves most of Port Arthur and a portion of Groves. In 2009, the school district was rated "academically acceptable" by the Texas Education Agency.[1] The district is headed by the PAISD School Board, which is ultimately responsible for the well-being of the district. It hires a Superintendent of Schools who is chiefly responsible for overseeing the day-to-day affairs of the district. This Superintendent accomplishes this with the aid of other individuals and groups that comprise the Administration. The current Superindent is Dr. Johnny Brown of Atlanta, Georgia. He is strongly supported by his Deputy Superintendent and long-time friend, Dr. Morcease Beasley, of Atlanta, Georgia. The Port Arthur Independent School District adopted a uniform dress code that was enforced District-wide during the 2007-2008 school year.[2]
