The Zodiac Game was a quiz programme devised by Ron Bareham that was produced by Anglia Television and aired on the ITV network from 1984 until 1986 and was hosted by Tom O'Connor. Russell Grant also made frequent appearances on the show. The first resident astrologer was Bernard Fitzwalter, still a worldwide magazine horoscope writer and author of best-selling books on popular astrology. Under his real name of Bernard Eccles he lectures widely on the esoteric and philosophic aspects of astrology and was instrumental in setting up the Sophia Project, bringing the teaching of Cultural Astronomy and Astrology to UK universities.
