Zabergan, Samur Khan, or Sam-Or Khan (from Sabir) was a Kutrigur Khan, associated with the Eurasian Avars. Either under orders, or in revolt from them, he led the Kutrigur Bulgar Huns in attacks against Justinian I's northern frontier in 559. Either way, after him, the Avar Khagan Bayan ruled the Kutrigur Bulgar Huns. He is not to be confused with Zabergan who defended the Persian fortress at Chlomaron from the generals of Emperor Maurice in 586. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
