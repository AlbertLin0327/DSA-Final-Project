 Santa Rosa de Viterbo is a town and municipality in Boyac Department, Colombia, part of the Tundama Province a subregion of Boyaca. Viterbite, not a mineral but a mixture of Allophane and Wavellite, occurs in and was named after this municipality. Fernando Soto Aparicio, screen writer, poet, and novelist, was born in Santa Rosa de Viterbo in 1933. In the year 1810, a meteorite fell in Santa Rosa, and it was discovered by a farmer of the town. The mayor decided put it in the middle of the town, in front of the church. A hundred years later, the president Rafael Reyes decided to take it to Bogota. There it was divided in two big parts; one of the parts stayed in Bogota, and the other is actually in a museum in Chicago. Coordinates: 553N 7259W / 5.883N 72.983W / 5.883; -72.983
