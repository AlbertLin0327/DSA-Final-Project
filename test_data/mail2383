The Eldorado Casino is a 16,000sqft (1,500m2) casino located in Henderson, Nevada. It is owned by Boyd Gaming Corporation. In 1962, the Wheel Casino was purchased by Sam Boyd, general manager of the Mint, along with his son Bill and two other partners.[2][3] Boyd renamed it to the Eldorado Casino. In operating the casino, he emphasized Henderson's small-town feel, which reminded him of his early days in Las Vegas.[2] In 1965, the Boyds acquired the adjacent Royal Club, doubling the Eldorado's size.[2] On August 30, 2007, a $700,000 renovation was completed.[4] Coordinates: 360155N 1145900W / 36.0320584N 114.9832964W / 36.0320584; -114.9832964
