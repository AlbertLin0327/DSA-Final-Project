Thomas (Tom) Tribone is the founder and CEO of Guggenheim Global Infrastructure Company (GGIC), a firm dedicated to owning and operating energy and infrastructure projects around the globe. He is also Chairman of the board of directors of a public investment fund, Infrastructure India PLC [LON: IIP.L][1] He has served as a board member for a number of corporate,[2] industry[3] and academic organizations.[4] Tribone previously served as Executive Vice President and the number-two executive of the AES Corporation[5] before he left that position to start his own company, Franklin Park Energy,[6] which was renamed GGIC. Mr. Tribone served as CEO of Franklin Park for several years. Earlier he held general management positions at Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO). Early on in his career at ARCO, Tom Tribone advocated for the installation of some of the first acid rain pollution control equipment on industrial power plants.[7] He then turned to increasing industry energy efficiency by the use of improved processes, such as Cogeneration.[8] As one of the first participants in the global deregulation and privatization of the energy and infrastructure sectors, Mr. Tribone has originated and executed many large, path-finding transactions in the United States and in major emerging markets, such as Mexico, Brazil, India and China. Overseas, he completed the first direct foreign investment in Brazils energy sector after the full restoration of democracy and the election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso as President in the 1990s.[9] He led transactions to open foreign energy markets, such as the first private power plant in Mexico[10] and the first bilateral treaty between Brazil and Argentina for a natural gas pipeline[11] Activities like this and others, such as a power company dedicated to China,[12] helped develop the concept of a global electric power industry. In testimony before the U.S. Congress, Mr. Tribone observed that technological and market forces were shrinking the scope of natural monopoly.[13] This line of thinking led him to believe that there would be benefits in merging regulated monopolies with competitive firms and he conceived and completed the earliest consolidations in the United States between regulated utility companies,[14][15] and unregulated firms. This consolidation has been a major, continuing trend.[16] Tom Tribone is described as a most creative new business developer in the book Joy at Work.[17] Author Peter Grose, in his book Power to People, offers an additional description of Tribones entrepreneurial contributions.[18] In China, Mr. Tribone is involved in bringing an efficient, environmentally friendly road-building technology developed in the United States, asphalt-rubber,[19] to China for the first time.[20] As an undergraduate, Tom Tribone was exposed to the research of psychologist Frederick Herzberg at Case Western Reserve University, where Herzberg served as a professor. Partly based on these findings and his own experience, Tribone developed a unique, people-centered management style that has been written about by authors such as Robert H. Waterman Jr. (the co-author of one of the most influential business books ever written, In Search of Excellence).[21] In his book, What America Does Right[22] Waterman has written of Tribone: "But Tom Tribone is one of those people who resist the status quo." In the book, Tribone's ideas were summarized in the title of a chapter called "Everyone a Leader" in which Waterman described some of Tribone's management concepts. One example related how, while leading a unionized manufacturing plant early in his career, Mr. Tribone materially increased manufacturing capability and employee satisfaction through a new combination of specific guidance and light-handed supervision. In Robert M. Grant's case study, "AES Corporation: Rewriting the Rules of Management," Grant[23] relayed Tom Tribone's ideas on the subject of teams and how they can be, in Tribone's words, "a natural way to get big things done while preserving the dignity of each person."
