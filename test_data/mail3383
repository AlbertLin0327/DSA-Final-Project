 The 1940 Texas Longhorns football team represented the University of Texas in the 1940 NCAA college football season. The main highlight of the season was the Impossible Catch by Noble Doss against Texas A&M which set up the only score of the game. [1] On November 3, 1941, the Longhorns became the first Texas Longhorn football team to reach #1 in the AP Poll.[2] They were crowned National Champions by four different rating systems: Clyde Berryman, James Howell, Loren Maxwell, and the Williamson System.[3] None of these rating system's however were deemed major rating systems by the NCAA. Therefore, the 1941 National Championship is not officially recognized by the NCAA or the University of Texas. [4] [5] Before the season began, Tom Landry left the Longhorns and joined the Army Air Corps.[6] [7] [8] [9] The 1947 Texas Longhorns football team represented the University of Texas in the 1947 NCAA college football season. They were crowned National Champions by the Massey Ratings System, however this poll selection is not deemed major by the NCAA therefore the school does not officially recognize the 1947 season as National Champions. [11] The 1948 Texas Longhorns football team represented the University of Texas in the 1948 NCAA college football season. After the season, Tom Landry signed with the New York Yanks of the All-America Football Conference.[13] The 1949 Texas Longhorns football team represented the University of Texas in the 1949 NCAA college football season.
