The The Aspergers Society of Ontario was founded in 2000 by Canadian parents of children with Asperger syndrome (AS), and professionals. The society is solely devoted to serving the AS population. In particular, Margot Nelles, the society's former chair, and mother of two sons with AS, has worked extensively to raise public awareness and help families. The current Chair of the society is Kevin Stoddart, who holds a Ph.D from the University of Toronto in social work. His practice is dedicated to counselling families affected by Asperger syndrome. Stoddart served as editor of Children, Youth and Adults with Asperger Syndrome: Integrating Multiple Perspectives, a book presenting recent research on AS aimed at clinicians, and produced in collaboration with the Aspergers Society of Ontario.[1] The society provides education, resources and support to individuals with AS, their families, educators, medical and mental health professionals, employers, government and the community. The goals of the Aspergers Society of Ontario are to improve public and professional awareness and understanding of the challenges, strengths and needs of individuals with AS and their families as well as promote and support research and the development of diagnostic, treatment and education programs for those with AS. It also provides information and referrals for families and professionals and others interested in AS initiate programs and services which respond to the needs of those with AS and their families. The society operates social skills groups for children 8 to 12 years old diagnosed with AS in cooperation with CAMH, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (Clarke site), which are overseen by Dr. Leon Sloman of the Child, Youth and Family Program. The society also organizes a monthly social group for young adults with Asperger syndrome, ages 19 to 30+ in the Greater Toronto Area. The focus of the group is socializing, establishing relationships and enjoying a variety of recreational activities in the community.
