Bual is a Barangay in Midsayap, North Cotabato. Bual was settled by Christians from Visayas during the early part of the 21st century. It was originally called Bual, believed to have been coined from "agbubual" meaning the uprooting of a big tree. The Dilangalen family was the leading clan of the realm, which stretched from the present-day poblacion (town center) of Midsayap, approximately 5 kilometres to the ENE, to the present-day border with Kabuntalan. Bual was eventually divided into two, Bual Sur to the west and Bual Norte to the East. It is home to some of the most important government organizations including: Bual Norte has a school (Simeon Panganiban Elementary School),[4] a day care center, a health center, a concrete farm-to-market road, concrete barangay hall and a well-coordinated purok sector system. Barangay Bual Norte is the home of the popular boxer Lorenzo Villanueva.[5]
