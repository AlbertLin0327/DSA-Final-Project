State Route 249 marker Alabama State Routes Interstate  US State State Route 249, or SR-249, is a 5-mile (8.0km) long route in the United States that serves as a connection between Alabama's State Route 27 in Ozark with Fort Rucker. The northern terminus of SR-249 is located at its intersection with State Route 27 just west of downtown Ozark. From this point, the route travels in a southwesterly direction as Andrews Avenue in route to its southern terminus at the eastern gate of Fort Rucker.
