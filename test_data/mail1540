Elverum Station is a railway station located at Vestad, on the west side of Glomma of Elverum, Norway. The station is on the Rros Line, in addition to being the terminus of the Solr Line. It was opened in 1862 as part of the HamarGrundset Line. The current station building was drawn by Paul Due and constructed as part of the Solr Line in 1913. The station is not longer manned. The restaurant was taken over by Norsk Spisevognselskap on 24 November 1921. They retained operation until 8 May 1931, when it was transferred back to private operation.[1]
