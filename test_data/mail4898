 The India  Sri Lanka HVDC Grid Interconnection is a proposed project to link the national grids of India and Sri Lanka. The project involves the construction of a HVDC connection between Madurai in southern India, and Anuradhapura in central Sri Lanka, through the Palk Strait. The link would measure 285 kilometres (177mi) in length, including 50 kilometres (31mi) of submarine cables, and would take more than three years to construct. It would be implemented by the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited and Ceylon Electricity Board.[1] Having been contemplated since 1970, the project has four implementation alternatives in consideration:[2] The connection will be developed in two phases, of which the first phase, scheduled to complete in the near-future, would enable the transmission of 500 MW between the two countries. The second phase would enable a 1,000 MW transmission capacity, the target capacity. It is expected to reach a total development cost of approximately US$800,000,000. Such a connection between the two countries would enable the nations to sell excess energy, thus saving valuable resources.[3]
