Jazz is a relatively new apple variety from New Zealand. It is the result of a cross between Royal Gala and Braeburn made by Plant & Food Research in 1985.[1] It is also known as Scifresh. It was launched in April 2004. Jazz apples are being grown under license in New Zealand, UK, Washington state in the US, Australia, France, Chile, Italy, Switzerland and Austria. Jazz is simply not a new variety. It is merely a trademark associated with the actual variety which is 'Scifresh" If Jazz is used as a noun and identifies the apple itself it becomes an invalid trademark 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
