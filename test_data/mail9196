Harold Galt Dickie (18741954) was a New Zealand politician of the Reform Party and from 1936 of the National Party. He represented the Patea electorate in Parliament from 1925 to 1943, when he retired. In 1950 he was appointed to the Legislative Council by National, as a member of the so-called suicide squad charged with voting for the abolition of the Council (or Upper House). He was awarded an OBE in 1953.
