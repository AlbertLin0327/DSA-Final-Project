Listed below in chronological order are the Minor League Baseball players chosen by USA Today as recipients of the USA Today Minor League Player of the Year Award. Since 1988, the award has been given annually to the minor-league player who is judged by USA Today baseball experts as having had the most outstanding season. Of the thirteen votes cast each year, two votes go to the player selected by fans in the online voting at USATODAY.com.[1]
