Here at the Mayflower is an album released by Barry Manilow in 2001. The album is a concept album based on an apartment complex. The album marked the first album to include all original material since 2:00 AM Paradise Cafe in 1984. Here at the Mayflower also marked an end to a period in which Manilow recorded cover albums of non-original material, although over the next decade, his albums would prove once again to be cover albums, until the release of 15 Minutes in 2011. It was also his first album with new record label Concord Records. Manilow had left Arista Records after a span of over 20 years there (with the exception of two years at the RCA label between 1985-1986). Singles "Turn The Radio Up" and "They Dance!" both hit the top 30 on the Adult Contemporary Chart. There were different covers for the US and UK versions. American Idol vocal coach Debra Byrd, Manilow's longtime backup singer, makes an uncredited appearance on "Say Goodbye" and "I Don't Wanna Know" on this release only. Also only on this release, "She Should'a Been Mine" and "The Night That Tito Played" features dialogue by Manilow.
