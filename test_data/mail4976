Sorbus sitchensis, also known as Sitka Mountain-ash, is a small shrub of the western United States. A multistemmed shrub, it is indigenous to the Pacific Coast of North America, from Alaska to northern California and eastward to Idaho and western Montana.[2] The otherwise similar Sorbus scopulina has yellow-green sharp-pointed leaflets that are sharply serrated over most of their length.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
