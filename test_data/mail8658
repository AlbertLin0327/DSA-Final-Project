The Republican Alliance for Democracy (French: Alliance Rpublicaine pour la Dmocratie), (Arabic:     ) is an opposition political party in Djibouti, founded by Ahmed Dini Ahmed. In the parliamentary election held on 10 January 2003, the party was part of the Union for a Democratic Change (Union pour l'Alternance Dmocratique), which won 37.3% of the popular vote but no seats in the National Assembly.
