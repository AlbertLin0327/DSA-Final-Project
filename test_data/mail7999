The FIL European Luge Championships 1938 took place in Salzburg, Austria under the auspices of the Fdration Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing (FIBT - International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation in (French)) under their "Section de Luge", a trend that would continue until the International Luge Federation (FIL) was formed in 1957. Tietze won his fourth straight championship in this event.
