Gone, Just Like a Train is the tenth album by Bill Frisell to be released on the Elektra Nonesuch label. It was released in 1998 and features performances by Frisell, Viktor Krauss and Jim Keltner.[1] The cover art is by comics artist Jim Woodring. The Allmusic review by Richard S. Ginell awarded the album 4 stars callining it "an immensely likable, easy-grooving CD that defies one to put a label on it... this is thoughtful, free-thinking, ear-friendly jamming that was recorded in bustling Burbank, CA. but sounds as if it was laid down in a relaxed cabin in the hills".[2]
