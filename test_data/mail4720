The Ossetian Military Road (Russian: - , Georgian:   ) was constructed, between 1854 and 1889, by Imperial Russian authorities in the Caucasus. The road runs through the Rioni and Ardon river valleys and links Kutaisi, Georgia with Alagir, Russian Federation, crossing the Greater Caucasus crest through the Mamison Pass. The 270-km-long route is seldom used today, having been supplanted by the Trans-Caucasian Highway. Coordinates: 424058N 434338E / 42.6827N 43.7271E / 42.6827; 43.7271
