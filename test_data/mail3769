Miss Great Britain is a female beauty contest currently held in London. Between 1956 and 1989, it was held in the seaside resort of Morecambe. It is one of the oldest of its kind in the country, with the first edition held in 1945. Previous title holder Miss Great Britain 1997 Liz Fuller is the new owner of the business.[citation needed] Unlike other beauty pageants, the annual event is not held to send its winner (or participants) to any specific international contests. Some of the international pageants which had been represented by Miss Great Britain were Miss Universe, Miss World, Top Model of the World and Miss World Tourism. The current title holder is Miss GB 2010 Amy Carrier from Liverpool. The Grand Final of Miss Great Britain 2010 will be held in December in Western Super Mare at the new Grand Pier. As opposed to its British counterparts such as Miss England, Miss Northern Ireland, Miss Scotland, Miss Wales and Miss United Kingdom, Miss Great Britain is not affiliated with the Miss World Organisation. The 2006 title holder was Preeti Desai who hailed from Cleveland. Desai made history when she became the first ever winner of Indian ethnicity when she replaced the dethroned Danielle Lloyd. Lloyd had lost the crown after stirring up scandals for posing nude for Playboy magazine and dating one of the judges during her participation in the pageant.[1] Danielle Lloyd has been re-instated into the Wall of Fame/ Previous winners as of January 11, 2010. Rachael Tennent, a project co-ordinator, was awarded the crown of Miss Great Britain. Along with the crown, the new titleholder also bagged a car, jewellery and a modelling contract. Tennent had previously competed for the Miss Scotland 2006 title which she placed 2nd runner-up. The event was held in Grosvenor House in Park Lane, London. Tennent did not complete her reign which resulted in Gemma Garrett (who was the 1st runner up in 2007) taking over the title of Miss Great Britain for the rest of the year.[2] The 2008 event did not take place due to financial difficulties as a result of the global financial crisis.[3] The event took place on May 12, 2009 at the Caf de Paris in Central London. Following the previous years non-event, a strong PR campaign orchestrated by the show's executive producer Jade Reuben, helped to re-introduce the event to the nation, with some 70,000 online entrants being whittled down through national heats to the final 12 girls. Heavily covered by the media, the eventual winner was Miss Newcastle - Sophie Gradon, 23.[4] She will not go to Miss Universe as reported by the press; please see above. That girl is Clair Cooper. Archives of Miss Great Britain are held at The Women's Library at London Metropolitan University, ref 5MGB www.missgreatbritain.co.uk
