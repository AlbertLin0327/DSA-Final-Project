2CQH Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the IGF2BP2 gene.[1][2][3] This gene encodes a member of the IGF-II mRNA-binding protein (IMP) family. The protein encoded by this gene contains several four KH domains and two RRM domains. It functions by binding to the 5' UTR of the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) mRNA and regulating IGF2 translation. Alternate transcriptional splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized.[3]
