Net1 are an Internet Service Provider based in the north east of Ireland. Net1 deliver broadband services to homes and businesses using FWA (Fixed Wireless access) from a base stations in Counties Louth, Meath, Cavan, Monaghan, Fingal and parts of Armagh, Westmeath, Tyrone, Longford and Fermanagh. Net1 is authorised in the Republic of Ireland by ComReg and in Northern Ireland by Ofcom. A telephone line is not required to receive the Net1 broadband services. Each base station's coverage area has a radius of 20km using Near Line of Sight technology, meaning that foliage and buildings can obstruct the signal. In August 2007, Net1 started offering a VoIP service, meaning that their customers no longer required a phone line to use Internet and telephony services. Net1's main competitors in the market are Digiweb, Irish Broadband, and Ice Communications and to a lesser extent Clearwire and ADSL providers eircom, BT and UTV
