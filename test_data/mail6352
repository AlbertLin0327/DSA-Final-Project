Backstairs Passage Glacier (752S 16236E / 75.033S 162.6E / -75.033; 162.6Coordinates: 752S 16236E / 75.033S 162.6E / -75.033; 162.6) is a glacier about 2 nautical miles (4km) long, draining east along the north side of Mount Crummer to the Ross Sea. The Magnetic Pole Party, led by Edgeworth David, of the British Antarctic Expedition, 190709, ascended this glacier from the Ross Sea, then continued the ascent via Larsen Glacier to the plateau of Victoria Land. So named by David's party because of the circuitous route to get to Larsen Glacier.[1] This article incorporatespublic domain material from the United States Geological Survey document "Backstairs Passage Glacier" (content from the Geographic Names Information System).
