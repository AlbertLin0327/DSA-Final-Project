Gamla nature reserve is a nature reserve and archaeological site located in the center of the Golan Heights, about 20km south to the Israeli settlement Katzrin. The nature reserve has two streams - the Gamla stream and the Daliot stream - the highest waterfall in Israel and the Israeli occupied territories (51 meters high), a Dolmen field containing about 700 dolmens, the largest nesting colony of Eagles in Israel and the Israeli occupied territories, a variety of wild life and different wild plants - especially birds of prey as well as the ancient city of Gamla. The reserve also has a monument for the Jewish Golan Heights settlers whom were killed during the Israeli wars and as a result of terror attacks.[citation needed] The reserve also has remains of an ancient village from the Byzantine period.
