Soroca is a district in north-east Moldova. Its administrative center is the town of Soroca. At 1 January 2011, the population of the region was 100400. Archeological evidence of prehistoric occupation dating to 35000 to 50000 years ago has been found in the Soroco region near the village of Rudi. In about 400 to 300 BCE, ancient defensive walls were constructed. From the 800s to the 1100s AD, two cities developed. They were called "Farfuria Turceasca" and "Germanariul". In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries a genoese fortress appeared at Alchiona. In the period 1439-1457 villages are mentioned: Visoca, Vasilcu, Rudi and Pirlita. In the second half of the 16th century Stephan the Great built a wooden fortress on the former Alchiona mount. The fortress was transformed into its present form between 1543-1546 during the reign of Peter IV Rare. The creation of the town allowed for trade along the Nistru while providing protection from foreign invasion. For many years Soroca was a centre for arts and agricultural markets for the Principality of Moldova. At various points in time, Soroca was affected by wars with Tartars, Cossacks, Poles and Russians. Between 1684-1699, under control of the Poles, changes in Soroca were made. A deep moat was dug; a well was dug in the courtyard. 14 stone casemates inside[clarification needed]. Gradually over time, with more stable rule, the town and its region lost military importance. In 1812, Soroca was occupied by Russia. The population became more varied as Russians, Ukrainians and Jews moved to the region. From 1849 to 1917 Soroca was governed as part of the Basarabia region of the Russian Empire. In 1918, at the conclusion of World War I, Bessarabia was made part of Romania. Until 1944, Soroca remained the administrative centre for this Romanian region. In 1944, as World War II reached its end, Soroca became part of the MSSR. Moldova became an independent state in 1991. Soroca has since remained an administrative region of Moldova. The main geographical feature of Soroca is the Nistru Plateau. The terrain is hilly with deep valleys, dales and ravines. Other features include a gently rolling plain to the north west and the Raut and Nistru rivers. The highest points in Soroca are Vadeni Hill at 347m and the Visoca Hill at 330m. The soil is grey or brown to the height of the Nistru prominence. In other areas, the soils are humic-calcareous, chernozem, alluvial soils or swampy. There are active processes of erosion, karst, torrents of mud and sometimes, landslides in the Soroca district. The climate in Soroca is temperate-continental. Winter is usually mild and short with an average temperature of -5 to 6 degrees Celsius. Summer is long and warm with an average temperature of 20 to 21 degrees Celsius. The average annual rainfall is 485mm. Soroca has a suitable climate for farming cereals, sugar beet, tobacco and also for horticulture. Fauna in the district is typical of steppe areas. In the Nistru basin there are 68 species of fish. Most of Moldova's 270 bird species are present. There is both natural and introduced wildlife. The introduced species include 19 types of mammal, 37 bird species and 7 types of reptile. Native creatures include foxes, hedgehogs, stone marten, deer, wild boar, raccoon dog and wolf. 7 percent of the district is forested. Common trees include oak, hornbeam, maple, linden, ash and elm. Beneath the trees are hawthorn, hazel, cocksfoot, honey bear and others. Granite can be found in Cosauti and building stone at Ocland, Vrncu and Visoca. Cretaceous limestones and iron ores were discovered near the village of Vrncu. Limestone, for instance in Visoca, is mined for chalk and chalk dust (which is used to make paint). Banks of chalk are also found throughout the Nistru, including in Cremenciug, Soroca, Vasilcu, Vrncu and Cerlina. The limestone is extracted in Visoca. The Nistru river creates 93km of the eastern boundary of Soroca. The barrier of the Nistru plateau means the tributaries are short (15 to 25km).
