Philip Morris was a British tobacconist and a cigarette importer whose name was later used for Philip Morris Inc. Ltd. established in New York in 1902. In 1847, Philip Morris opened a shop on Bond Street in London. By 1854, he started making his own cigarettes. In 1870, Morris began to produce Philip Morris Cambridge and Philip Morris Oxford Blues (later called Oxford Ovals and Philip Morris Blues). Morris died in 1873 while his widow Margaret and brother Leopold Morris carried on his cigarette trade.
