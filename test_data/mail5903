The Yili is a small horse from the north-western Xinjiang region of China. They are compact in conformation with a light head and straight profile. The withers are well pronounced and the back is short and strong, though the loin is long. The legs are clean.[1] Yili horses are normally bay, chestnut, black or gray[2] and are an average height of 14 hands high.[1] Yili horses originated around 1900 from Russian breeds crossed with Mongolian stock.[2] Don, and Don-Thoroughbred crosses as well as Orlov Trotters were used from 1936 on to improve the native horses. In 1963 the decision was made to aim for a draft-type horse.[1] Yili horses are used for riding and driving, and also bred for their meat and milk.[2]
