Alexander Charles Luis "Aly" Borromeo[1] (born 28 June 1983) is an American born Filipino footballer who plays for Kaya and is the current captain of the Philippines national team. Previously a goalkeeper, he has since become a utility player, playing as a central midfielder or center forward for his club and mainly as a central defender for the national team.[2] Borromeo joined Kaya in 1999, and has been the captain of the first team for several years during his tenure.[3] He went on a loan to Global during the 201011 season and led the club to be the champions of the 201011 United Football Cup during the season. On October 15, 2011, in his first match for Kaya in the 201112 United Football Cup against Diliman, Borromeo incurred an ACL injury, which sidelined him for the club and the national team.[4] After almost seven months, he made his return for the 201112 United Football League season on May 12, 2012 as a substitute against Loyola Meralco Sparks, which ended a 22 draw. In the following match against Global FC on May 16, 2012, he scored an equalizer in second half injury time to end in a 11 draw.[5] Borromeo first represented the Philippines at under-19 level during the 2000 AFC Youth Championship qualifiers and was also a goalkeeper at that time.[6] Four years later, Borromeo would make his full international debut playing in all four matches in the 2004 Tiger Cup.[7] This time he was playing as a striker and he assisted both goals by Emelio Caligdong, to give the Philippines their first ever win in the competition, defeating Timor-Leste 21.[8] He has also represented the Philippines at under-23 level. He captained the Philippines under-23 team during the 2005 Southeast Asian Games on home soil and was converted to a central defender.[9] He also scored in the 42 win against Cambodia.[10] However, the Philippines failed to progress to the knockout stage.
