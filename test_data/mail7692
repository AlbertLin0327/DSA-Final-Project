Anna Kazanjian Longobardo is the former director of the engineering firm Woodward Clyde Group and executive at Unisys Corp. Anna Longobardo headed Unisys, supporting the development of military systems and weather radar systems worldwide from 1988 to 1995, before she retired. Longobardo is one of the founders of the Society of Women Engineers, which elected her a fellow in 1991.[1] In 1949 Anna Longobardo became the first women to receive a B.S. in mechanical engineering from Columbia University, and in 1952, she received a master's degree from Columbia. As a result of her undergraduate experience, Longobardo became interested in the area of analog and digital computer applications. She went on to make huge contributions to the aerospace engineering field. Longobardo was one of the first women in the United States to work on board navy submarines, destroyers and other vessels. She designed and evaluated submarine-towed buoy used to calibrate sonar. Her design increased navigational accuracy for submarines that operate below periscope depth. After working as a systems engineer at American Bosch Arma Corporation, Longobardo joined Sperry Rand Corp, which became the now Unisys Corp. At Unisys, Longobardo directed projects to develop radiation-tolerant computers for the United States Air Force. She managed programs for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Later, Longobardo became the woman executive of Unisys Corporation's defense unit. She was responsible for organizing complex military and weather radar systems in more than 100 locations across the world. Longobardo has served on the corporate boards of Woodward Clyde and Woodward Clyde Federal Services. In 1963 Nelson Rockefeller appointed Longobardo to the New York State Women's Council. From 1966 to 1970, Longobardo was the Director of the Technical Societies Council of New York. In the same year, she was named one of New York's "100 Women of Influence." Longobardo maintains a close relationship with Columbia. A former trustee, she is the first woman to receive the Egleston Medal for distinguished engineering achievements. She was also the Vice Chair of Columbia's Engineering Foundation Board and served as Chairman of the Bronxville Design Review Committee. She is a current member of the Mechanical Engineering Advisor Board and of the Barnard Science Advisory Council. Longobardo has also been the President of the CESAA Board of Directors and president of the Columbia Society of Graduates. She was the first woman president of Columbia University's alumni Federation. Anna Longowardo has been a long active member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the Joint Engineering Management Committee, and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
