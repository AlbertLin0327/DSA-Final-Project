 Appearances (Goals). Yu Dabao (simplified Chinese: ; traditional Chinese: ; pinyin: Y Dbo, born 18 April 1988 in Qingdao, Shandong) is a Chinese international football player who currently plays as a striker for Dalian Aerbin in the Chinese Super League. Yu Dabao would start his career playing for Qingdao Hailifeng in the second tier of Chinese football and would soon be called-up to the Chinese U-17 team. With the Chinese U-17 team he would go to the 2004 AFC U-17 Championship and was quickly regarded as one of the best prospects in China because of his aerial and counterattacking abilities saw China win the tournament.[1] This would see many clubs reportedly interested in the young talent, including Ajax, Newcastle United and Rangers. However, the Chinese striker decided to join Benfica on a 3-year deal. In his debut match, only 5 days and 3 training sessions after he arrived in Portugal, Dabao scored 3 goals and assisted a fourth in a junior squad Benfica match against Portimonense. Due to Dabao's strong performances for Benfica's junior squad, the striker was given the chance of training with the senior team for the pre-season, and was officially added to the Benfica senior squad in 2007-08. Yu Dabao made his official debut with Benfica on September 26, 2007, in a Portuguese League Cup game against Estrela da Amadora, 0-0 (4-5 win to Benfica on penalties), having played the 90 minutes. On May 13, 2009, Yu revealed in a telephone interview that he was about to leave Portugal to spend the offseason holiday back in his homeland China, he received a call from Benfica asking him to stay in Lisbon until further notice. He made 10 appearances for Olvais Moscavide and scored 4 goals, but was unable to save them from relegation as they suffered defeat in the last match of the season, for which they needed a win to survive.[2] He had a trial with FC Dallas in the MLS in February 2010,[3] but didn't get a contract. He moved back to China and signed a contract with Tianjin Teda.[4] In the morning of 27 February 2012, it was reported that Yu would transfer to Guangzhou Evergrande with a reported fee of 15 million.[5] However, Guangzhou Evergrande withdrew from the transfer talk in the afternoon that day. He transferred to Dalian Aerbin, who was newly promoted to Super League the next day. After becoming a regular for Tianjin Teda Yu Dabao would be called-up by the Chinese Head coach Gao Hongbo to make his senior international debut against Estonia on 18 December 2010 where he came on as a substitute in a friendly, which China won 3-0. After making several further appearances he would score his first goal for China on 22 February 2012, in a 2-0 unofficial friendly home victory against Kuwait. Yu Dabao wouldn't have to wait long before he gained his first official goal for China when he scored in a 3-1 victory on 29 February 2012 against Jordan in a 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification game.[6] (Correct as of 25 May 2012) Last update: 29 February 2012 Tianjin Teda China U-17
