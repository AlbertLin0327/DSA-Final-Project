The SS Cambria of the Anchor Line (Glasgow) was wrecked on the return eastbound for Europe, off the north west of Ireland on 19 October, 1870. Four of its boats were found drifting off the Giant's Causeway with no sign of the passengers or crew. The wrecked stern washed ashore at Islay, Scotland. 179 passengers and crewmembers were drowned; there was one survivor.[1] The ship was first launched on 1 March 1869 in Glasgow by Robert Duncan & Company.[2]
