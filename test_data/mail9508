Erzsbet Cseszneky de Milvny et Nemesvarbk (Slovak: Albeta esnekov) was a Hungarian noble who lived in the 17th18th centuries. Erzsbet Cseszneky was either a member of the Veszprm branch or of the Nemesvarbk branch, of the Cseszneky family. Her parents had probably became impoverished because despite her high-born origin, she got married to a Slovak butcher from Nagycsa, Matej Bel-Funtk (Hungarian: Mtys Bl-Funtik). They settled down in Zlyom county. In 1684 she gave birth to Matthias Bel (Bl Matys), a famous writer, polyhistor, and Lutheran theologian. After her husband's death in 1704, Erzsbet made a lot of sacrifices for her son's education. She is also highly respected by the Hungarian and the Slovak Lutheran Churches as their benefactor.[original research?]
