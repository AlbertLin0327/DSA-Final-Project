N40 national IE.png Roads in Ireland Motorways Primary Secondary Regional The N40 road (commonly known as the Cork South Ring Road) is a national primary road in Cork City, Ireland, which forms an orbital route around the south side of the city, linking the N22 at Ballincollig to the N25 at the Dunkettle Interchange. The present N40 was created on 23 February 2012 via statutory instrument. [1] The newly designated N40 was formed from parts of both the N22 and N25. It is intended that once the Cork North Ring Road is completed, that the N40 will comprise a complete orbital route of Cork city. The Cork South Ring Road commences at junction with the N22 at the end of the Ballincollig bypass. The N40 next passes the Curraheen Interchange before then meeting the Bandon road roundabout, which forms a junction with the N71. This junction also gives access to west Bishopstown. From there, The South Ring Road runs east over the Kinsale Road Roundabout by flyover. It also meets the N27 to Cork International Airport, Kinsale Road and the N27 South Link Road to the city centre by exiting onto the Kinsale Road Roundabout by slip road. The Cork South Ring Road continues east - on the way it overpasses Douglas and meets the N28 to Ringaskiddy (Carrigaline Road). From here the road passes under the River Lee through the Jack Lynch Tunnel. On 4 August 2006, a 2.5km (1.6mi) flyover of the Kinsale Road Roundabout was opened to traffic 6 months ahead of schedule. The project cost 55 million euro and consists of 3 lanes eastbound, 2 lanes west-bound and four off-ramps connecting the dual-carriageway to the roundabout. The opening of this flyover now allows traffic to flow continuously from the Jack Lynch Tunnel to the Sarsfield Road Roundabout without stopping. North of the tunnel, the South Ring Road ends at an interchange with the M8 to Dublin, the N8 to the city centre and the N25 to Waterford City. On 12 March 2010, the NRA confirmed that both the Bandon Road Roundabout and the Sarsfield Road Roundabout would have flyovers built, with traffic travelling on the Cork South Ring Road, being able to avoid both roundabouts when staying on the mainline.[2] While minor work on this scheme had already commenced in 2008, full construction start on 6 July 2011 and is due to be finished by Quarter 3, 2013.[3] As well as two flyovers being built, the dual carriageway between both roundabouts will be upgraded and straightened with two access roads being built on either side for local access. A Cork North Ring Road is in the planning phase with a number of different routes having been proposed. The road will run from Glanmire to the junction of the N40 and the N22 in Ballincollig.[4] Upon completition, it is likely that this stretch of high quality dual carriage/motorway will be designated as part of the N40. In addition, the stretch of motorway presently designated as the M8 may also be redesignated as the N40, meaning the N40 will completely encircle Cork city.
