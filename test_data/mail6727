Ivan Yakovych Franko (Ukrainian:   , pronounced[ivn jkovt frnko]) (August 27[O.S. August 15]1856  May 28[O.S. May 15]1916) was a Ukrainian poet, writer, social and literary critic, journalist, interpreter, economist, political activist, doctor of philosophy, the author of the first detective novels and modern poetry in the Ukrainian language. He was a political radical, and a founder of the socialist and nationalist movement in western Ukraine. In addition to his own literary work, he also translated the works of such renowned figures as William Shakespeare, Lord Byron, Pedro Caldern de la Barca, Dante, Victor Hugo, Adam Mickiewicz, Goethe and Schiller into the Ukrainian language. Along with Taras Shevchenko, he has had a tremendous impact on modern literary and political thought in Ukraine. Franko was born in the Ukrainian village of Nahuievychi (Ukrainian: )[1] located then in the Austrian kronland Galicia, today part of Drohobych Raion, Lviv Oblast, Ukraine. As a child he was baptized as Ivan by Father Yosyp Levytsky known as a poet and the author of the first Galician-Ruthenian Hramatyka and who was exiled to Nahuyevychi for a "sharp tongue". At home, however, Ivan was called Myron because of a local superstitious belief that naming a person by different name will dodge a death.[2] Franko's family in Nahuyevychi was considered "well-to-do", with their own servants and 24 hectares (59acres) of their own property.[3] Franko senior was reportedly to be a Ukrainized German colonist, or at least Ivan Franko himself believed.[citation needed] That statement is also supported by Timothy Snyder in his book The reconstruction of nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, which claims that Yakiv Franko was a village blacksmith of German descent. Snyder however stated that Ivan Franko's mother was of Polish petty noble origin,[4] while other sources state that she came from an impoverished Ukrainian noble background, from the well-known Ukrainian noble family Kulchytsky [5] and was remotely related to Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny.[citation needed] Ivan Franko attended school in the village Yasenytsia Sylna from 1862 until 1864, and from there attended a Basilian monastic school in Drohobych until 1867. His father passed away before Ivan was able to graduate from the gymnasium (realschule, but his stepfather supported Ivan in continuing his education. Soon, however, Franko found himself completely without parents after his mother died as well and later the young Ivan stayed with totally unrelated people. In 1875 he graduated from the Drohobych realschule, and continued on to Lviv University, where he studied classical philosophy, Ukrainian language and literature. It was at this University that Franko began his literary career, with various works of poetry and his novel Petri i Dovbushchuky published by the students' magazine Druh (Friend), whose editorial board he would later join. A meeting with Mykhailo Drahomanov at Lviv University made a huge impression on Ivan Franko and later developed into a long political and literary association. Franko's own socialist writings and his association with Drahomanov led to his arrest in 1877, along with (among others) Mykhailo Pavlyk and Ostap Terletsky. They were accused of belonging to a secret socialist organization, which did not in fact exist. However, the nine months in prison did not discourage his political writing or activities. In prison Franko wrote the satire Smorhonska Akademiya (The Smorhon Academy). After release, he studied the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, contributed articles to the Polish newspaper Praca (Labor) and helped organize workers' groups in Lviv. In 1878 Franko and Pavlyk founded the magazine Hromads'kyi Druh (Public friend). Only two issues were published before it was banned by the government; however, the journal was reborn under the names Dzvin (Bell) and Molot (Mallet). Franko published a series of books called Dribna Biblioteka (Petty Library) from 1878 until his second arrest for arousing the peasants to civil disobedience in 1880. After three months in the Kolomyia prison, the writer returned to Lviv. His impressions of this exile are reflected in his novel Na Dni (At the Bottom). Upon his release Franko was kept under police surveillance. At odds with the administration, Franko was expelled from Lviv University - an institution that would be renamed Ivan Franko National University of Lviv after the writer's death. Franko was an active contributor to the journal Svit (The World) in 1881. He wrote more than half of the material, excluding the unsigned editorials. Later that year, Franko moved to his native Nahuievychi where he wrote the novel Zakhar Berkut, translated Goethe's Faust and Heine's poem Deutschland: ein Wintermrchen into Ukrainian. He also wrote a series of articles on Taras Shevchenko, and reviewed the collection Khutorna Poeziya (Khutir poetry) by Panteleimon Kulish. Franko worked for the journal Zorya (Sunrise), and became a member of the editing board of the newspaper Dilo (Action) a year later. He married Olha Khorunzhynska from Kyiv in May 1886, to whom he dedicated the collection Z vershyn i nyzyn (From tops and bottoms), a book of poetry and verse. The couple for some time used to live in Vienna where Ivano Franko met with such people as Theodor Herzl and Tom Garrigue Masaryk. His wife was to later suffer from a debilitating mental illness due to the death of the first-born son, Andrey,[6] one of the reasons that Franko would not leave Lviv for a treatment in Kiev in 1916, shortly before his death. In 1888, Franko was a contributor to the journal Pravda, which, along with his association with compatriots from Dnieper Ukraine, led to a third arrest in 1889. After this two-month prison term, he co-founded the Ruthenian-Ukrainian Radical Party with Mykhailo Drahomanov and Mykhailo Pavlyk. Franko was the Radical party's candidate for seats in the Parliament of Austria-Hungary and the Galicia Diet, but never won an election. In 1891, Franko attended Chernivtsi University (where he prepared a dissertation on Ivan Vyshensky), and afterwards attended Vienna University to defend a doctoral dissertation on the spiritual romance Barlaam and Josaphat under the supervision of Vatroslav Jagi, who was considered the foremost expert of Slavic languages at the time. Franko received his doctorate of philosophy from University of Vienna on July 1, 1893. He was appointed lecturer in the history of Ukrainian literature at Lviv University in 1894; however, he was not able to chair the Department of Ukrainian literature there because of opposition from Vicegerent Kazimierz Badeni and Galician conservative circles. One of his articles, Sotsiializm i sotsiial-demokratyzm (Socialism and Social Democracy), a severe criticism of Ukrainian Social Democracy and the socialism of Marx and Engels, was published in 1898 in the journal Zhytie i Slovo, which he and his wife founded. He continued his anti-Marxist stance in a collection of poetry entitled Mii smarahd (My Emerald) in 1898, where he called Marxism "a religion founded on dogmas of hatred and class struggle." His long-time collaborative association with Mykhailo Drahomanov was strained due to their diverging views on socialism and the national question. Franko would later accuse Drahomanov of tying Ukraine's fate to that of Russia in Suspil'nopolitychni pohliady M. Drahomanova (The Sociopolitical Views of M. Drahomanov), published in 1906. After a split in the Radical Party, in 1899, Franko, together with the Lviv historian Mykhailo Hrushevsky, founded the National Democratic Party where he worked until 1904, when he retired from political life. In 1902, students and activists in Lviv, embarrassed that Franko was living in poverty, purchased a house for him in the city. He lived there for the remaining 14 years of his life. The house is now the site of the Ivan Franko Museum. In 1914, his jubilee collection, Pryvit Ivanovi Frankovi (Greeting Ivan Franko), and the collection Iz lit moyeyi molodosti (From the Years of My Youth) were published. The last nine years of his life, Ivan Franko rarely wrote himself as he suffered from rheumatism of joints that later led to a paralysis of his right arm. He was greatly assisted by his sons to write his latter works, particularly Andrey. He died in poverty at 4 p.m. on May 28, 1916. Those who came to pay their respects saw him lying on the table covered with nothing but a ragged sheet. His burial and burial-clothes were paid for by his admirers, and none of his family came to visit him. These events caused Heinrich Wigeleiser of the Academic Gymnasium to tell his Ukrainian students: Franko was buried at the Lychakivskiy Cemetery in Lviv. Soon after his death the world witnessed the creation of two Ukrainian republics. Olha Fedorivna Khorunzhynska (m. 1886-1916), a graduate of the Institute of Noble Dames in Kharkiv and later the two-year higher courses in Kiev, she knew several languages and played a piano, died in 1941 According to Roland Franko his grandfather was 1.74 metres (5.7ft) tall, had a red hair, always wore mustache and the Ukrainian embroidered shirt (vyshyvanka) even with a dress-coat. Some of Franko's descendants emigrated to the USA and Canada. His grand-nephew, Yuri Shymko, is a Canadian politician and human rights activist living in Toronto, who was elected to Canada's Parliament as well as the Ontario Legislature during the 1980s. In 1876, Lesyshyna Cheliad and Dva Pryiateli (Two Friends) were published in the literary almanac Dnistrianka. Later that year he wrote his first collection of poetry, Ballads and Tales. His first of the stories in the Boryslav series were published in 1877. Franko depicted the harsh experience of Ukrainian workers and peasants in his novels Boryslav Laughs (18811882) and Boa Constrictor (1878). His works deal with Ukrainian nationalism and history (Zakhar Berkut, 1883), social issues (Basis of Society, 1895 and Withered Leaves, 1896), and philosophy (Semper Tiro, 1906). He has drawn parallels to the Israelite search for a homeland and the Ukrainian desire for independence in In Death of Cain (1889) and Moses (1905). Stolen Happiness (1893) is considered as his best dramatic masterpiece. In total, Franko has written more than 1,000 works. He was widely promoted in Ukraine during the Soviet period particularly for his poem Kamenyari (Stonemasons) that carries some revolutionary political ideas, hence earning him a name Kamenyar. In 1962 the city of Stanyslaviv in western Ukraine (formerly Stanisaww, Poland) was renamed Ivano-Frankivsk in the poet's honor. He also is associated with the name Kamenyar for his famous poem, Kamenyari (The Stonemasons) on the "permanent revolutionary" (relating to one of the socialist ideologies), particularly during the Soviet regime, although his political views mostly did not correspond to the Soviet ideology. In the late 1970s astronomer Nikolai Chernykh named an asteroid which honored Franko in this manner, 2428 Kamenyar.
