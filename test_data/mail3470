The Kievo-Poree dialect (Macedonian: - , Kievsko-poreki dijalekt) is a member of the central subgroup of the western group of dialects of the Macedonian language. The dialect is spoken in a vast area in the Republic of Macedonia and mainly in the cities Kievo and Makedonski Brod. It is also native to the villages of the region Poreje, such as Samokov and those around Kievo. Because of the migration of the population from Poreje, the dialect is spoken in the region of Polog and in the capital Skopje. The Kievo-Poree dialect is closely related to the Prilep-Bitola dialect, Upper Polog dialect with which they share many common characteristics.[1] This dialect can be found in many books and novels, and one of the more popular is the novel "Milion maenici" by Risto Krle. The Kievo-Poree dialect has a significantly small number of Serbian and Turkish loan words than the North Macedonian dialects.             , , .         , , .   ,        : , ,     ?     : , ,     ?
