Golra Sharif Railway Museum is a railway museum located in the Sector E-11 of Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan. it is a junction station in the northern section of the Pakistan Railways system in the Rawalpindi Division of the Pakistan Railways. This railway station is the site of a venerated Railway Museum housing the relics and memorabilia associated with railways dating back to the days of the British Raj. The Railways station covered in a thick foliage of 125-year-old Banyan trees along with its museum is a major attraction for tourists and locals alike and is becoming a major attraction for railway enthusiasts.[1] Golra Railway Junction, a station that once linked Peshawar, Kohat and Havalian, the Museum presents glimpses from the contours of history. Set up in 1882 and upgraded as junction in 1912, the Golra Railway Station today enjoys more importance due to its Museum. Situated South East to Margalla Hills and 1994 feet above sea level, the Golra Railway Museum is at a few minutes drive from the federal capital and 17 kilometers towards East from Taxila, the cradle of Gandhara civilization. Golra Sharif Railway Station is a junction connected to Taxila, Peshawar, Attock City, Multan and Mianwali. The building is a grand mansion of Victorian age. The beautiful building comprises five hall-like rooms with high ceilings characteristic of British architecture in the Indian subcontinent. The building is made of a yellow grindstone found in the nearby hills of Taxila. The nearly exhausted quarries spew out the same yellow-colored stone on a daily basis.[2] Railway stations are more than often associated with serenity, beauty, mystery and romance. Golra Sharif Railway Station epitomizes this convention more than any other railway station on Pakistan Railways system. Like all stations of Pakistan Railways with the exception that the row of age old Banyan trees holding canopy over the two platforms and the expanding yard have rendered the landscapes the peace and serenity. The northern railway road runs into the heart of the North Western Frontier province. It was the logistics artery of the British during the Afghan military campaigns at the turn of the twentieth century. It has since become an important trade route which protrudes into Afghanistan through the infamous Khyber Pass. The important junction station currently lies on the main line of the Pakistan Railway rail road which connects the rest of the country in the south to Peshawar in the north. More than 55 trains run through its two platforms every day. The Railway Heritage Museum was created in October 2003. From Relics dating back to the inception of railways in the subcontinent by the British to memorabilia depicting the creation of the museum are housed and preserved in this heritage site. The Rail Heritage Museum is housed in three different halls to contain artifacts reflecting history of Railway over a period of more than 150 years including almost 100 years of undivided India. As a part of the museum there is a big yard where cranes, trolleys, saloons, locomotives, coaches and tracks are marshaled impressively, portraying the railways march forward through time. Golra Sharif Railway Heritage point can be approached both by road and rail. It takes 15 minutes of rail journey from the Rawalpindi station, and almost 5 minutes drive from the famous Shrine of Pir Mehr Ali Shah in E-11 sector Islamabad. The museum houses an impressive blend of artifacts covering the many facets of the railways systems. Mechanical models, signalling systems, communication tools and the evolution of operational protocols are preserved and chronologically displayed in the museum. The museum also displays the social impact and anthropological implications of the railways on the human geography of the multi-racial sub continent. An open yard displays a wide array of relics which have become extinct on the railway lines around the world. The steam and electric locomotives, a German postal car, a saloon car used by the last Indian viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, and another saloon car belonging to the Maharaja of Jodhpur from the Jodhpur railways given as a wedding present to his daughter are a few examples.[3] The museum was envisioned by Ishfaq Khattak, the DS of the Rawalpindi division. In late 2002, the headquarters issued instructions to all the divisions of the Pakistan railways to scrap all the old items including crockery, furniture, locomotives, and saloons for narrow gauge lines. Ishfaq Khattak saw it an opportunity accumulate all the relics and create a heritage site. By the end of 2003, this feat was achieved mostly due to the diligence of officers working on the project without any funding from the government. Pure unabated love for the railways had been the major driving force towards the completion of this venerated project. Though the museum was inaugurated officially on 5 march, 2007, it had already opened its doors to the public on 26 September 2003. The railway museum boasts of a very special collection of memorabilia from different periods in time from the British Raj to the occupation of Indian held railway station during the 1965 war with India. May it be the saloon cars of yore or the long forgotten steam locomotives this museum has got it all. Everything has been fully preserved given the limited resources and a fledgling organization of Pakistani railways. A new building has been erected on the premises to be converted into an art gallery and a caf. The heritage site and the beautiful serene looking railway station has become one of the centerpieces of the Railway image in the country. The heritage project provided the impetus of the resumption of a steam safari in different areas of Pakistan. A mighty steam locomotive hauling luxury coaches across the beautiful scenic routes of the plains of Punjab or the rolling hills of the north west has become a romantic sight. This has generated an immense public interest with respect to tourism and entertainment. Since then the museum has been repeatedly highlighted in TV commercials and the site has been used by numerous TV plays and films. It has become the station of choice for the entertainment industry as they have become frequent visitors to this beautiful location. This station can be seen in numerous advertisements adorning the billboards and TV screens. Dignitaries whether related to railways or not have frequently visited as this heritage museum has become a huge source of attraction to people because of its uniqueness. School children are specially brought to this place as the concept of train travel is diminishing fast, especially within the new generations. The number of tourists has also increased following the resumption of the steam safari which takes tourists to the archeological digs at Taxila, the center of the Gandhara civilization.
