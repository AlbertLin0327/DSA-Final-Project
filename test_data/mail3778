Bakunin's Bum, named after the anarchist philosopher Mikhail Bakunin, is a musical collaboration between Norman Nawrocki and Godspeed You! Black Emperor drummer Aidan Girt. Their first recording, Fight to Win! was released in 2001 on G7 Welcoming Committee Records as a benefit for the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty and features spoken word by anti-poverty activists over instrumental music. They are currently on G7 Welcoming Committee Records.
