Rumeal James Robinson (born November 13, 1966 in Mandeville, Jamaica) is a retired American professional basketball player. Growing up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Robinson graduated from Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and went on to play guard (basketball) for the University of Michigan. After a strong showing in Michigan's 1989 NCAA championship, Robinson gave up his senior year of eligibility and was drafted #10 in the first round of the 1990 NBA Draft. Robinson averaged 14.3 points and 5.7 assists during his collegiate career at the University of Michigan. He achieved fame during his junior year for sinking two crucial free throws with 3 seconds left in the 1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship to win the game for the Wolverines over Seton Hall University.[1][2] Robinson was drafted in 1990 by the Atlanta Hawks with the 10th pick. He was signed to a four-year deal with the Hawks.[3] He also played for the New Jersey Nets, Charlotte Hornets, Portland Trail Blazers, Phoenix Suns and Los Angeles Lakers. Robinson also spent time in the Continental Basketball Association. He played in the Euroleague during the 200102 season for KK Zadar. He was one of three Robinsons that the Portland Trail Blazers had in their line-up for the 199596 NBA season. The others were Clifford Robinson and James Robinson (both no relation). After his playing career was over, Robinson attempted to become a property developer in his native Jamaica. On September 4, 2009, he was arrested and charged with bank fraud, bribery and wire fraud related to the financing of the development project. His adoptive mother also alleged that she was swindled out of her home by one of Robinson's business associates when Robinson asked her to use it as collateral for a loan.[4] On September 8, 2010, Robinson was convicted on 11 counts in federal court in Des Moines, Iowa. He was found guilty on charges including bank bribery, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and making a false statement to a financial institution.[5] On January 7, 2011 he was sentenced to 6 years (78 months[6]) in prison for fraud[2][7] and other crimes.[6] In March, 2012, a federal judge ruled that US$369,000 of Robinson's pension fund could be seized to help cover restitution owed due to his sham business deal.[6]
