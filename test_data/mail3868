In psychology and cognitive science, the telescoping effect is people's tendency to perceive recent events as being more remote than they are, and to perceive distant events as being more recent than they are. More specifically, the former is known as backward telescoping, and the latter as forward telescoping. Between backward and forward telescoping there is a point where events are just as likely to be displaced backward as forward in time. The original work is usually attributed to a 1964 article by Neter and Waksberg in the Journal of the American Statistical Association.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
