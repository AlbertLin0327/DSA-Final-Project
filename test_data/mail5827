Arnold Town was formed in 1989 following a merger between the old established Arnold F.C. and Arnold Kingswell. The new club adopted the yellow of Arnold F.C. and the blue of Kingswell and established themselves at the King George V Ground  usually referred to as Gedling Road. From the Central Midlands League, the Eagles moved into the NCE Division 1 and then after a single season into the NCEL Premier Division. In 2002 the Eagles had their best run in the FA Cup in recent years when they reached the 4th Qualifying Round before going out to Conference club Scarborough in front of a Gedling Road crowd of over 900. The club won its first piece of silverware since 1999 back in May 2005 as they lifted the Notts Senior Cup. A goal from Scott Huckerby was enough to give the Eagles a 10 victory over Eastwood Town in front of a crowd of more than 650. The club had been seeking a new home for many years and have at last secured planning permission for the Eagle Valley complex. The campaign to safeguard the future of the club received magnificent support from across the footballing spectrum  not only from friends in Northern Counties East but also from the wider footballing world. Hundreds of letters of support poured in from non-league clubs throughout the country and the professional game at its highest levels  Football Leagueand Premier League added their voice: Bobby Charlton, Sir Alex Ferguson, Gary Lineker, Roy Keane, Nottingham Forest, Notts County, Kevin Keegan, Nigel Clough and many hundreds of other individuals and clubs throughout the football world. The club finally got the go ahead for the new ground on 17 March 2005 as they learned the result of a Public Inquiry.
