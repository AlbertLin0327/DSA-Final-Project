The Japanese addressing system is used to identify a specific location in Japan. In Japanese, addresses are written using the opposite convention from Western addresses, starting with the biggest geographical entities down to the more specific ones. Japanese addresses begin with the largest division of the country, the prefecture. These are generally called ken (), but there are also three other special prefecture types: to () for Tokyo, d () for Hokkaid and fu () for the two urban prefectures of Osaka and Kyoto. Following the prefecture is the municipality. For a large municipality this is the city (shi, ). Tokyo has both ordinary cities and special wards (ku, ), each of which has the status of a city. For smaller municipalities, the address includes the district (gun, ) followed by the town (ch or machi, ) or village (mura or son, ). The next element of the address is the location within the municipality. Many cities have wards (ku, ), which in turn may be divided into machi or ch (). Towns may have smaller parts with names like ch, aza (), or aza (), or even smaller koaza (). The final three elements of the address in Jkyo hyji () style are the city district (chme ), the city block (ban ) and finally the house number (g ). Chme and ban numbers are usually assigned by order of proximity to the center of the municipality. G numbers are usually assigned by clockwise order around the ban city block. The final three elements of the address in Chiban () style are the city district (chme ), the land number (banchi ) and finally the land number extension. The land number and land number extension designate a piece of land registered in the land registry. A land number extension is assigned when a piece of land is divided into two or more pieces in the registry. As these are all numbers, they are usually simply written as a string, 1-2-3, starting with the chme and ending in the g. In urban apartment buildings it is not unusual to add the apartment number as a fourth element. This three-element system is relatively new introduction, and is not completed in some areas such as older area of the cities or sparsely populated rural areas, where only the banchi is written after machi or aza. Street names are seldom used in postal addresses (except in Kyoto and some Hokkaid cities such as Sapporo), and most Japanese streets do not have names. Banchi blocks often have an irregular shape, as banchi numbers were assigned by order of registration in the older system, meaning that especially in older areas of the city they will not run in a linear order. It is for this reason that when giving directions to a location, most people will offer cross streets, visual landmarks and subway stations such as "at Ch-dori and Matsuya-dori across the street from Matsuya and Ginza station", for a store in Tokyo. In fact, many businesses have maps on their literature and business cards. In addition, signs attached to utility poles often specify the city district name and block number, and detailed block maps of the immediate area are sometimes posted near bus stops and train station exits. In addition to the address itself, all locations in Japan have a postal code. After the reform of 1998, this begins with a three-digit number, a hyphen, and a four-digit number, for example 123-4567. A postal mark, , may precede the code to indicate that the number following is a postal code. In Japanese, the address is written in order from largest unit to smallest, with the addressee's name last of all. For example, the address of the Tokyo Central Post Office is or The order is reversed when writing in roman letters, to better suit Western conventions. The format recommended by Japan Post is: In this address, Tokyo is the prefecture; Chuo-ku is one of the special wards; Yaesu 1-Chome is the name of the city district; and 5-3 is the city block and building number. In practice it is common for the chme to be prefixed, as in Japanese, resulting in the somewhat shorter As mentioned above, there are certain areas of Japan that use somewhat unique address systems. Sometimes the differing system has been incorporated into the official system, as in Sapporo, while in Kyoto the system is completely different from, but used alongside the official system. Kyoto and Sapporo have addresses based on their streets being laid out in a grid plan, unlike most Japanese cities. Although the official national addressing system is in use in Kyoto  in Chiban style, with ward (, ku?), district (, chme?), and land number (, banchi?), the ch divisions are very small, numerous, and there is often more than one ch with the same name within a single ward, making the system extremely confusing. As a result, most residents of Kyoto use an unofficial system based instead on street names, a form of vernacular geography. This system is, however, recognized by the post office and by government agencies. For added precision, the street-based address can be given, followed by the ch and land number. Sometimes multiple houses share a given land number, in which case the name (either just family name, or full name of resident) must also be specified; this name is generally displayed in front of the house on a hysatsu (?, name plate), often decoratively presented, as house numbers are in other countries. The system works by naming the intersection of two streets and then indicating if the address is north (, agaru?, "above"), south (, sagaru?, "below"), east (, higashi-iru?, "enter east"), or west (, nishi-iru?, "enter west") of the intersection. More precisely, the two streets of the intersection are not treated symmetrically: one names the street that the address is on, then gives a nearby cross street, and then specifies the address relative to the cross street. What this means is that a building can have more than one address depending on which cross street intersection is chosen. The official address to Kyoto Tower is:[1] However, the informal address to Kyoto Tower,[2] is: This address means "south of the intersection of Karasuma and Shichij streets"  more precisely, "on Karasuma, below (south of) Shichij" (Karasuma runs north-south, while Shichij is an east-west cross street). The street address may alternatively be given as  (with street (, dri?) inserted), indicating clearly that the address is on Karasuma street. However, the system is flexible and allows for various alternatives, such as: For less well known buildings, the official address is often given after the informal one, as in the address for the Shinatora Ramen restaurant: As the initial part of the address is familiar, it is often abbreviated  for example, Kyto-fu, Kyto-shi (?, "Kyoto Prefecture, Kyoto City") can be abbreviated to Kyto-shi (?, "Kyoto City"). More informally, particularly on return addresses for in-town mail, the city and ward can be abbreviated to the initial character, with a dot or comma to indicate abbreviation  there are only 11 wards of Kyoto, so this is easily understood. For example,  Kyto-shi is abbreviated to  Ky and  Shimogy-ku is abbreviated to Shimo. Combining these (and dropping okurigana), one may abbreviate the address of Kyoto tower from: to: Sapporos system, though official, differs in structure from regular Japanese addresses. The city is divided into quadrants at its centre by two intersecting roads. Blocks are then named based on their distance from this point. The east-west distance is indicated by chme (which is a slightly different usage of chme when compared to other cities), while the north-south distance is indicated by j, which has been incorporated into the ch name. The address to Sapporo JR Tower [2] is: 525 Kita-5-j Nishi-2-chme 5-banchi, Ch-ku, Sapporo-shi This address indicates that it is the fifth building on a block located 5 blocks north (kita) and 2 blocks west (nishi) of the centre. Although the streets of Sapporo form a fairly clean grid, outside of the city centre it gets less and less practical to use the original grid starting point. In these cases an arbitrary dividing starting point is chosen from which to measure the counting of chme and j. Some cities in Ishikawa Prefecture, including Kanazawa and Nanao, sometimes use Katakana with ordering of Iroha instead of numbers for blocks. These katakana are called bu (). For example, the address of the Kagaya Hotel [3] in Nanao is: 926-0192 80 Wakuramachi yo 80, Nanao-shi, Ishikawa-ken 926-0192 The current addressing system was established after World War II as a slight modification of the scheme used since the Meiji era. For historical reasons, names quite frequently conflict. In Hokkaid many place names are identical to names found in the rest of Japan; this is largely the result of past immigration into Hokkaid of people from mainland Japan. Historians note that there is also a significant similarity between place names in Kansai region and those in northern Kysh. See Japanese place names for more. Two "chme-name plates()" are with Romaji for people unable to read the Japanese. Left plate is Ginza 4 chme road cross at 5 chme 7-2, next to "Ginza 4 chme koban", where the opposite side of main street from Wak. Right plate is Shimbashi 2 chme, block name is "underground city of (Shimbashi station) east exit ()" without banchi number. An older chme address name plate in Kuwabara, a residential section of Matsuyama, Ehime. The address of this block in Japanese is 3.
