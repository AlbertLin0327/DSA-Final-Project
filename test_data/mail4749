Content:
Catalytic oxidation (CO) combines the production of random and honeycomb block catalysts with fixed bed technology and integrated tube or plate heat exchangers. It is used for destroying contaminants in the exhaust gases from industrial processes at temperatures ranging from 260C (500F) to 345C (650F).[1] [2] Catalytic heaters generate flameless heat from a supply of combustible fuel and oxygen from air as oxidant. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
