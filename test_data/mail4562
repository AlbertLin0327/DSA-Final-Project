The CF conomiques Forestiers des Landes was a 750mm(2ft5 12in) narrow gauge railway operating in France. The line operated over 12 kilometres between Roquefort and Lencouaq-Jourets. It opened in 1907 and closed in 1934, and was the only railway built to this gauge in France. When narrow gauge railways were first proposed in France, it was intended they could be constructed in either 750 mm and metre gauge, however pressure from the Military made metre gauge compulsory in 1888. Later 600 mm gauge lines were allowed.
