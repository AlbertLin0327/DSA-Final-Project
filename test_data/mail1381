Juan Mora Fernndez (1784 San Jos - 1854) was Costa Rica's first elected head of state. He was considered a liberal and decided to move the capital from Cartago to San Jos. Juan Mora was elected as the first head of state in 1825. He is remembered for instituting land reform, and he followed a progressive course. As a consequence of his land reform structure, he inadvertently created an elite class of powerful coffee barons. The barons eventually overthrew one of his later successors, Jos Mara.
