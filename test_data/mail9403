Omukama: often translated as "king", (O)Mukama means in Bantu (Batoro-, Banyoro- and other languages) something like "superior milkman/milkbringer". The title "Omukama" is used in the region of Uganda and neighbouring countries, especially in the kingdoms of "Bunyoro" and "Toro". After reestablishing the Ugandan kingdoms in the 1990s the Omukama are nowadays accepted "kings" with a merely cultural function.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
