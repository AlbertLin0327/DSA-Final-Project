Intimate Strangers (French: Confidences trop intimes) is a 2004 French film directed by Patrice Leconte. It was shown in Competition at the 2004 Berlin Film Festival. Paramount Classics acquired the United States distribution rights of this film and gave it a limited U.S. theatrical release on July 30, 2004; this film went on grossing $2.1 million in the United States theaters,[1] which is considered a good result for a foreign language film.[2] Ruth Vitale (who was the president of Paramount Classics at that time) was pleased with this film's performance in the United States market.[3] In this movie, a woman wanders into an accountant's office mistaking him for a psychiatrist, and an unusual relationship begins. Paramount Pictures (the parent studio of Paramount Vantage/Classics) is developing a Hollywood remake version of this film, with Hilary Swank attached to star.[4]
