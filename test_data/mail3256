Gotti: The Rise and Fall of a Real Life Mafia Don is a 1996 HBO original movie made for television directed by Robert Harmon. It features Armand Assante, as the infamous Gambino crime family Boss John Gotti, William Forsythe, and Anthony Quinn. The film was the highest rated original telefilm in HBO history at that time, according to IMDB. Assante won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Special, for his performance. Assante also received a Golden Globe nomination the same year. The movie begins in 1972 in New York and ends in 1992 with Gottis imprisonment. Gottis association with three mobsters is also highlighted in the film: a father-son like relationship with family Underboss Aniello Mr. Neil Dellacroce, his deep but rocky friendship with Gotti crew member and longtime friend Angelo Ruggiero, and the respect and ultimate frustration that he felt for the man who became his Underboss, Salvatore Sammy the Bull Gravano. The film details Gottis rise within the Gambino crime family and his ranks from soldier, then captain (or capo), and finally, Boss. The final title was achieved through the dramatic murder in public of Gambino family boss Paul Castellano in 1985. Following the murder of Castellano, the movie concentrates on the legal trials of John Gotti; one for assault, two for racketeering under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statutes. Gotti's famous personality, trial acquittals and media attention are all dramatized. The movie ends with Gottis conviction and sentencing to life imprisonment at Marion Federal Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois, due to the fact that Gravano turns states evidence and agrees to testify against Gotti. The movie is primarily based on the columns of reporter Jerry Capeci, who also wrote the novel that documented Gottis rise and fall inside the Gambino crime family, and served as executive producer of the film which was based on his novel.
