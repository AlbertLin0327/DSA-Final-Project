Gwyneth Strong (born 2 December 1959) is an English actress. She is probably best known for her role in the popular BBC sitcom Only Fools and Horses as Cassandra, who was married to Del Boy's brother Rodney. Her first appearance was in Royal Court's production "Live Like Pigs", when she was eleven. In 1973, whilst a pupil at Holland Park School, she appeared in the horror film Nothing But The Night as Mary Valley, and she was a regular in the children's TV series The Flockton Flyer in 197779 as Jan Carter. She has appeared in the "Observation" segment about Detective Samantha Smith made for the 1990 series of The Krypton Factor, the two-part drama serial The Missing Postman as WPC Rachel McMahon, the BBC drama Real Women from 199798, as Hetty in ITV's Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married (1999), and in BBC drama Casualty in 2003 as Jim Brodie's wife, Elizabeth. She also starred in the much acclaimed but little seen 1975 TV Film "It's A Lovely Day Tomorrow" written by Bernard Kops, directed by John Goldsmidt, depicting the real-life drama of the Bethnal Green Tube Disaster in WW2. She also starred in the "True Confessions" two-part episode of the series "Frost", thus reuniting her on-screen with David Jason. In 2008, she appeared on the West End stage in the musical, Our House, in which she played Kath Casey. In May 2010, Strong appeared on an episode of Midsomer Murders. She married former Footballers' Wives and Eldorado star Jesse Birdsall on 15 July 2000. They have one daughter, Lottie (born 1991), and one son, Oscar (born 1988).
