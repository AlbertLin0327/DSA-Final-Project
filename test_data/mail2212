Foot in Mouth is Goldfinger's second live album. Recorded during a 2001 tour of the UK, it features tracks from their previous studio albums, a preview from the album Open Your Eyes (Going Home), and a cover of Operation Ivy's song Smiling. The tracks were recorded in Bristol (track 7), Birmingham (tracks 3 and 10), London (tracks 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 14, and 15), Nottingham (track 14), and Portsmouth (Tracks 1, 2, 11, and 12). The CD also includes a video for Free Me (a song about animal rights) and for San Simeon using footage of Goldfinger on tour.
