Tony Soper is an American actor. He is perhaps best known for playing rookie Dr. Cliff Margolis on the short-lived multi-ethnic medical drama Kay O'Brien, which aired in the fall of 1986 on CBS. After a decade, Soper quit acting and went to work for Microsoft Corporation. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
