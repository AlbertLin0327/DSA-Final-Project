Rtmnad (American title: Dog Days, British title: What Are You Doing After the Orgy?) is a Swedish dark comedy film from 1970 directed by Jan Halldoff. In the Stockholm archipelago lives the barber Assar Gustafsson (played by Carl-Gustaf Lindstedt) peacefully with his 17-year old daughter Anna-Bella (played by Christina Lindberg). One day Assars wife Sally (Ulla Sjblom) comes back after five years of absence and she starts up a brothel with the young girl as the main attraction. The film contains a lot of nudity and violence, but also a lot of humor, and has achieved cult film status in Sweden, although, as of 2006, it has not yet been released on DVD.
