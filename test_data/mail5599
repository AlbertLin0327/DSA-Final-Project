Daniel Timofte (born 1 October 1967) is a retired Romanian football midfielder and is currently a coach. He is today a legend in Samsun and remains a fan favourite.[citation needed] He debuted in Divizia A with Jiul Petroani in 1986. The team was relegated that season, but Timofte helped them earn promotion again before he joined Dinamo Bucureti in 1989. The following season he won the double with Dinamo. He later played in Germany and Turkey, and he retired in 2000 after his third spell with Dinamo. Timofte made his debut for the Romanian national team in 1990 against Egypt, scoring in his debut match. At the 1990 FIFA World Cup he had a penalty kick saved in the penalty shootout against Ireland by Packie Bonner in the round of sixteen, which caused Romania's exit from the tournament. Timofte got 22 caps in total, the last in 1995, and scored 2 goals. Timofte played for Dinamo Bucureti against St Patrick's Athletic in the UEFA Cup 199091.[1] In Tolka Park, Dublin, the Irish home fans gave him mocking cheers for his shootout miss. A Bayer Uerdingen scout was at the match, which led to his transfer to Germany.[1] His football career was cut short by a knee injury.[1] He returned to Petroani and opened a number of bars, the first named "Penalty".[1]
