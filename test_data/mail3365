Carlton Ellington ("Carl") Cushnie is a businessman from the United Kingdom. In the late-1990s, he was estimated to be the richest black man in Europe and among the 100 wealthiest people in Britain. However his finance company, Versailles, went bust after an investigation by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1999 revealed that much of the company's turnover was fabricated. Cushnie was sentenced to six years in prison in 2004 after being found guilty of defrauding the company's investors. Cushnie was born in Kingston, Jamaica, and moved to London at the age of 13. He began his career as a computer programmer, before going on to found a successful software business. He then founded Versailles, a company which provided loans to small businesses. The company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1995. Its share price was 8 pence at the time of flotation, and rose to 250 pence in December 1999. Cushnie held a controlling stake in the company which gave him an estimated worth of 340 million. Following a six-figure donation to the Labour Party, Cushnie was chosen by Tony Blair to appear in a European election broadcast for the party in 1999 alongside Mick Hucknall and Alex Ferguson. In the broadcast, Cushnie spoke flatteringly about Blair's leadership abilities. In December 1999, following an investigation by the Department of Trade and Industry, Versailles collapsed after it emerged that much of its reported turnover had been fabricated. This resulted in shareholders, banks and creditors losing over 170 million. Cushnie claimed that the fraud had been perpetrated by the Versailles finance director, Fredrick Clough, and that he was unaware of it (and he continues to maintain that this was the case to this day). But in 2004, following a five-month trial and ten days of jury deliberations, Cushnie and Clough, were both found guilty of fraud (Cushnie on a lesser count of defrauding traders and Clough on the main count of the fraud in Versailles) and were both sentenced to six years in prison.
