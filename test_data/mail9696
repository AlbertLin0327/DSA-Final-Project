Joseph Musonda (born 30 May 1977 in Kalulushi) is a Zambian football defender. He was part of the Zambian 2006 African Nations Cup team, which finished third in group C in the first round of competition, thus failing to secure qualification for the quarter-finals. He was also picked in the 2008 squad for the AFCON and Zambia were eliminated in the group stage before being part of the 2010 AFCON squad that made it to the Quarter Finals eventually losing to Nigeria in a penalty shoot-out. He currently plays for Premier Soccer League side Golden Arrows and is the club captain. Musonda is naturally a right wing back but has also been deployed at left back in his career. The 2012 African Nations Cup final v Cte d'Ivoire was his 100th match for Zambia - but he was substituted due to an injury after just 11 minutes, his foot dragging across the ground as he spun to clear the ball. He left the field in visible distress, since the match was likely to be the most notable of his career. Notably, Didier Drogba from the opposing side came to comfort him as he was brought off the field. Zambia
