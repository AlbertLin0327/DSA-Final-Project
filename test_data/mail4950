Rep is a small settlement in the Pohorje hills in the Slovenska Bistrica municipality in northeastern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Styria. It is now included with the rest of the municipality into the Podravje statistical region.[2] A small roadside chapel to the east of the village was built after the First World War in memory of a local soldier killed.[3] Administrative centre: Slovenska Bistrica
