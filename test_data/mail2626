The Kia Joice, or Kia Carstar, is a compact MPV produced between 1999 and 2003 by the Korean manufacturer Kia Motors. The vehicle was a joint venture with the Hyundai Motor Company. The Joice shared the same platform as a Hyundai Santamo. The vehicle had a 2.0 litre petrol engine that produced between 120 and 139 horse power.[1] In 2001 a facelift was introduced for the European market. In 2003, the Joice was replaced by the Kia Carens.
