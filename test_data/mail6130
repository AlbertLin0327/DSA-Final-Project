In language learning, the principal parts of a verb are those forms that a student must memorize in order to be able to conjugate the verb through all its forms. The principal parts of an English verb are the bare infinitive, past tense and past participle. For example the verb 'to take' has the principal parts taketooktaken. The verb 'to do' has dodiddone and the verb 'to say' has saysaidsaid. Most verbs are regular enough not to require a knowledge of the principal parts. For example the verb love derives all its forms systematically (love, loves, loved, loving), and since these can all be deduced from the basic form (the citation, dictionary, or lexicographic form, which in English is the bare infinitive), no other principal parts have to be learned. With irregular verbs like the verb sing, on the other hand, the forms sang and sung cannot be deduced, so the learner of English must memorize three principal parts, singsangsung. From these, all other forms (like sings or singing) can be deduced. There are a handful of verbs in English that are so irregular that the principal parts are not enough to conjugate them fully. For example the verb 'to be' has the principal parts bewas/werebeen, showing an irregular past tense (was for the first- and third-person singular, and were for the rest), and an entirely irregular present tense (using am, is and are instead of forms derived from the first principal part be). (See also English verbs, English irregular verbs, English as an additional language.) There are four types of principal parts in the Icelandic language, determined by the type of verb: Icelandic weak verbs have the following principal parts: It's possible to make the present subjunctive mood (tt g bori, "though I eat") from the first principal part (a bora, "to eat"). It's also possible to make the past subjunctive mood (tt g borai, "though I ate") from the second principal part (g borai, "I ate"). In some other classes of weak verbs without 'a' as the thematic vowel, the present indicative singular undergoes more changes, but they are still to a large extent predictable. Icelandic strong verbs have the following principal parts: It's possible to make the present subjunctive mood (tt g finni, "though I find") from the first principal part (a finna, "to find"). It's also possible to make the past subjunctive mood (tt g fyndi, "though I found") from the second principal part (vi fundum, "we found"). The present singular indicative in this class also undergoes more changes(i-umlaut, dental suffix assimilation etc), which may let some verbs seem irregular at first glance. They are, however, mainly regular changes, like those in the weak verbs. Icelandic Preterite-present verbs have the following principal parts: It's possible to make the present subjunctive mood (tt g kunni, "though I knew") from the first principal part (a kunna, "to know"). It's also possible to make the past subjunctive mood (tt g kynni, "though I knew") from the third principal part (g kunni, "I knew"). Icelandic Ri-verbs have the following principal parts: It's possible to make the present subjunctive mood (tt g sni, "though I turn") from the first principal part (a sna, "to turn"). It's also possible to make the past subjunctive mood (tt g sneri, "though I turned") from the second principal part (g sneri, "I turned"). In Latin, most verbs have four principal parts. For example, the verb for "to carry" is given as port  portre  portv  porttum, where port is the first-person singular present active indicative ("I carry"), portre is the present active infinitive ("to carry"), portv is the first-person singular perfect active indicative ("I carried"), and porttum is the accusative supine. Most of the verb forms in Latin derive from the first two principal parts: portb, "I shall carry", is derived from the root port-, taken from the present infinitive. However, all active perfect forms are derived from the third principal part (so portveram, "I had carried", is taken from portv-) while the perfect participle (porttus, portta, porttum, "having been carried") is derived from the supine and is used to form passive perfect tenses with the auxiliary verb sum (such as porttum est, "it has been carried"). For many Latin verbs, the principal parts are predictable: port shown above uses a single stem, port-, and all principal parts are derived from them with the endings -  -re  -v  -tum. Others have more complicated forms: reg ("I rule") has the perfect form rx and supine rectum, derived as *reg-s and *reg-tum. A handful of verbs, such as sum - esse - fu - futrum ("to be") are simply irregular. A number of verbs have fewer than four principal parts: deponent verbs, such as hortr  hortri  horttus sum, "to exhort", lack a perfect form, as do semi-deponent verbs, such as aude  audre  ausus sum, "to dare"; in both cases, passive forms are treated as active, so all perfect forms are covered by the perfect participle. A handful of verbs are also defective, including the verb d  disse, "to hate", which only has perfect forms derived from a single stem. Verbs in Ancient Greek have six principal parts: present (I), future (II), aorist (III), perfect (IV), perfect middle (V) and aorist passive (VI), each listed in its first-person singular form: One principal part can sometimes be predicted from another, but not with any certainty. For some classes of verbs, however, all principal parts can be predicted given the first one. In Spanish, verbs are traditionally held to have only one principal part, the infinitive, by which one can classify the verb into one of three conjugation paradigms (according to the ending of the infinitive, which may be -ar, -er or -ir). However, some scholars believe that the conjugation could be regularized by adding another principal part to vowel-alternating verbs, which shows the alternation. For example, herir "to hurt" is usually considered irregular because its conjugation contains forms like hiero "I hurt", hieres "you hurt", where the vowel in the root changes into a diphthong. However, by including the first person singular, present tense, indicative mood form (hiero) as a principal part, and noting that the diphthong appears only when that syllable is stressed, the conjugation of herir becomes completely predictable. (See also Spanish verbs, Spanish conjugation.) In Scottish Gaelic there are two principal parts for the regular verb: the imperative and the verbal noun, for example pg  pgadh 'to kiss'. All finite forms can be deduced from the imperative pg ('kiss!'), all non-finite forms from the verbal noun pgadh ('kissing'). The ten irregular verbs can, with only two or three small aberrations (unexpected lenition), be deduced from four principal parts. The principal parts of a Ganda verb are the imperative (identical to the verb stem), the first person singular of the present tense and the modified stem. For example the verb okwogera 'to speak' has the principal parts yogeranjogerayogedde. The present tense, far past tense, near future tense, far future tense, subjunctive and infinitive are derived from the imperative. The present perfect, conditional and near past tense are derived from the modified stem. In theory the second principal part can be derived from the first, but in practice this is so complicated that it's usually memorised as a separate principal part. (See also Ganda verbs.)
