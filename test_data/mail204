Coordinates: 325107S 1165338E / 32.852S 116.894E / -32.852; 116.894 Congelin is a locality in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, north of Williams. It is located within the Shire of Williams. The townsite was requested by the "14 Mile Brook Progress Association" in 1911. The name, derived from a nearby pool, is of Aboriginal origin but its meaning is unknown. Gazetted in 1913,[1] the town did not develop and to this day remains a sparsely populated agricultural area on the edge of the Darling Scarp. Plans by the Shire of Williams to seal its part of the Congelin-Narrogin road are in progress.
