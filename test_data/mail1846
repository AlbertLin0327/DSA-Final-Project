Heald College is a for-profit, business-career college with multiple campuses in the Western United States. Prior to its acquisition by Corinthian Colleges Heald was a non-profit private College. The college was founded[1] in San Francisco, California, by Edward Payson Heald, on August 8, 1863, and known for many years as "Heald's Business College".[2] Heald College campuses are located in 12 cities: Concord, Fresno, Hayward, Modesto, Rancho Cordova, Roseville, Salinas, San Francisco, San Jose, and Stockton, all in California; and Portland, Oregon and Honolulu, Hawaii. Heald offers Associate in Applied Sciences degrees[3] and Associate of Arts degrees, diplomas or certificate, in 34 fields. Heald College has regional accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. In November 2009, Corinthian Colleges, Inc., purchased the Heald College's parent company for $395 million, simultaneously announcing plans to begin in 2011 offering online-only courses leading to degree programs based entirely on online-only coursework. However, Corinthian planned to retain the Heald name, as well as its faculty and staff.[4] Heald's Honolulu campus employs 90 staffers serving a student body of 1,300. It was founded in 1917 as Honolulu Business College, later merging with Cannon's Business College in 1973, and becoming a Heald College campus in 1993.[4] Heald College is regionally accredited at this time by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, and covers all campuses including the one in Portland Oregon.
