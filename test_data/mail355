Kelly Sheridan (born May 19, 1977 in Ottawa, Ontario) is a Canadian voice actress based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Sheridan has voiced various roles in anime and other animated cartoons, such as Barbie in the majority of the computer generated Barbie film series since 2001. She also voiced Sango in the dubbed version of the anime series InuYasha, Diana in the Martin Mystery series, and Theresa in Class of the Titans. She has been a member of Genus Theatre Company since August 2005. Before Gundam SEED Destiny came out in English, on many of the anime websites, Sheridan had mistakenly received credit for Stella Loussier's English voice. She was succeeded as the voice of Barbie by Diana Kaarina in 2010, beginning with Barbie: A Fashion Fairy Tale. Sheridan returned to the role in Barbie in A Mermaid Tale 2 and voices one of the main characters featuring Barbie in Barbie: The Princess and the Popstar alongside Diana Kaarina.
