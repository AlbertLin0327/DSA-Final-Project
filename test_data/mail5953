N78 National IE.png Roads in Ireland Motorways Primary Secondary Regional The N78 road is a national secondary road in Ireland. The 50km long road links the N77 national secondary road north of Kilkenny, County Kilkenny to the M9 national primary route at Mullamast in County Kildare. En route it passes through the towns of Castlecomer in County Kilkenny, Ballylynan in County Laois, and Athy in County Kildare. It is single carriageway throughout. Before the opening of the M9 motorway from Kilcullen to Carlow in 2009, the N78 ran from Athy to Kilcullen instead of Mullamast, but was then reclassified as part of the R418 regional road. That route once formed an integral part of the T6 - the old trunk road that connected the cities of Cork and Dublin before the contemporary numbering system was established.
