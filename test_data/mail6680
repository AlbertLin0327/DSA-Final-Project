A community of action (CoA), unlike a community of practice (CoP), exists in a situation that is structurally more open, where actors have the possibility of bringing about change. These more open situations might, for example, correspond to collective design teams in professional environments. CoAs possess some of the characteristics of communities, such as the development of a common language and mutual learning in the course of action. However, they also possess some of the characteristics typical of more associative social relationships, such as the voluntary nature of association and the importance of common goals in directing collective activity. Some argue that this makes CoAs more rational groups than CoPs.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
