Luis Po Moa Rodrguez (Vigo, Galicia, 1948) better known as simply Po Moa, is a Spanish writer, journalist. His specialised subject field is the history and origins of the Spanish Civil War, the Second Republic in Spain, Francoism and the various political movements of that era, all of which approaches it from an ultra conservative and pro-fascist perspective. During his youth, Moa was a radical anti-Francoist agitator. He was a militant of the Communist Party of Spain (and its reconstituted version), as well as the clandestine Maoist, designated-terrorist organisation GRAPO. Following the transition of Spain to democracy, Moa dedicated himself to the study of contemporary Spanish history, evolving over time to an organic ultraconservative Francoist position. Moa argues that the Popular Front were ultimately responsible for the Spanish Civil War and the rise of autocracy in Spain, claiming that they have left a legacy of "moral and political, intellectual devastation", accusing the left of hypocrisy in regards to democracy and totalitarianism. The polemical and politically incorrect nature of Moa's writings have gained him much public attention in Spain and a measure of controversy as a result; his best-selling book, Myths of the Civil War, with 150,000 units sold, was a best-seller for six consecutive months.[citation needed] Born during 1946 in Vigo, Galicia, Spain, Moa was a charter member of various Marxist-Leninist and Maoist tendency organisations as a youth, including GRAPO, which was the armed wing of the reconstituted Communist Party of Spain. It was involved in violent clashes with the government's Movimiento Nacional. Moa was present at the murder of a policeman on 1 October 1975, carried out after the execution of two ETA and three FRAP members. Two other members of GRAPO, Enrique Cerdn Calixto and Abelardo Collazo Arajo, were also present; Cerdn shot the police officer. Moa was expelled from GRAPO in 1977, he later recalled this period of his life in About a time and a country, the violent Left. After the Spanish transition to democracy his opinions changed towards increasingly conservative positions. He is an outspoken critic of the Spanish political left which he accuses of being the main cause of the Spanish Civil War.[1] He has also written essays on feminism, marxism, current Spanish politics and an autobiographical book about his experiences in the terrorist group GRAPO. In his books he criticizes strongly Franco's democratic, socialist and nationalist rivals. Moa is disliked by scholars,[2][3] such as Paul Preston, Alberto Reig Tapia, Javier Tusell, Justo Serna, Mercedes Yusta, Santos Juli or Enrique Moradiellos. While disagreeing with many of Moa's theses,[4] historian Stanley G. Payne has praised the work of Pio Moa.[5] He has been accused of homophobia by civil rights groups[6] and of being a defender of Francoism.[2][7] In an interview in 2008 he openly refused to condemn Franco's dictatorship.[8] However, he declares in his books that he does not defend the dictatorship, but rather criticizes his rivals.[citation needed] He was the editor of the historical journals Tanteos (19881990) and Ayeres (19911993) and a librarian at the Ateneo de Madrid, a prestigious cultural and literary institute in Madrid, belonging to its board of directors for three years.[citation needed] He currently writes for right-wing online newspapers such as Libertad Digital .
