Breaking Point is an American medical drama that aired on ABC from September 16, 1963, to April 27, 1964, continuing in rebroadcasts until September 7. The series, which was a spinoff of Ben Casey, stars Paul Richards and Eduard Franz. The series was created by Meta Rosenberg. Richards stars as Dr. McKinley Thompson, the chief resident in psychiatry at York Hospital, a fictitious hospital in Los Angeles. Eduard Franz co-starred as Dr. Edward Raymer, the hospital's psychiatric clinic director. McKinley was called Dr. Mac, by everyone on the staff, although more or less, the stories focused on the people whom came to the psychiatric clinic for their help. Like Ben Casey, which along with Marcus Welby, M.D. was one of the two most successful medical series aired on ABC, Breaking Point was a Bing Crosby Production filmed through Desilu Studios. In the fourth episode entitled "Bird and Snake", film star Robert Redford appeared as Roger Morton, along with Jack Weston as Sam Keller. This turned out to have been one of Redford's last television roles.[1] Notable guest stars include: The series producer, George Lefferts, had served in a United States Army psychiatric ward during World War II. Like Ben Casey, The Eleventh Hour, and Dr. Kildare on NBC (as well as the non-medical show Slattery's People), Breaking Point featured an older, experienced doctor and his younger understudy.[2] Breaking Point followed Wagon Train, which expanded to ninety minutes on ABC only for the 19631964 season. The program aired at 10 p.m. Monday opposite East Side, West Side and Mitch Miller's Sing Along with Mitch on NBC. Breaking Point writer Allan Sloane was nominated for an Emmy Award for "Outstanding Writing Achievement in Drama." The series also received an "Eddie" nomination as the "Best Edited Television Program" and a DGA Award nomination for director Robert Ellis Miller. All three nominations were for the episode "And James Was a Very Small Snail" broadcast on November 11, 1963, starring Harold J. Stone and Marsha Hunt as Joseph and Fran Babcock, respectively.[3]
