William "Bill" Marler, a nationally recognized[1][2] personal injury lawyer and food safety advocate, is Managing Partner of Marler Clark, a Seattle, Washington based law firm that specializes in foodborne illness cases. In 1993, Marler represented a plaintiff in a case against Jack in the Box regarding the E. coli O157:H7 outbreak, securing a $15.6 million settlement.[3] He subsequently directed his practice toward foodborne illness, representing many more people affected by diseases such as E. coli, hepatitis A, and Salmonella, among others. He has been involved in litigation relating to most of the large foodborne illness outbreaks in the United States, representing individuals against large companies such as Chili's, Kentucky Fried Chicken,[4] Dole, and ConAgra.[5] Marler is also involved with OutBreak, a nonprofit organization under the auspices of Marler Clark. In this capacity he travels extensively, discussing foodborne illness litigation and related issues with public health groups, fair associations, and food industry groups.[6] In addition, Marler has written articles about the same topics and maintains a frequently updated blog read by many in the legal and food safety communities. As a proponent of improved food regulation, Marler has been asked to speak to numerous groups to address the subject, including testimony to both the California State Senate Governmental Organization Committee[7] and the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce.[8] Marler contributes to the Food Poison Journal.
