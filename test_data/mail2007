Marcross (Welsh: Marcroes) is a small village and civil parish in the Vale of Glamorgan, south Wales. It consists of a public house (the Horseshoes Inn) and a few scattered houses, farms, and a small medieval church in the centre of the village. The cove to the south of the village has two lighthouses, one early 19th century and another from the mid-20th century. The cove is said to have been a looting station for pirates in the 18th century. Coordinates: 5125N 333W / 51.417N 3.55W / 51.417; -3.55
