Puerto Morelos is a town and sea port in Quintana Roo, Mexico's easternmost state, on the Yucatn Peninsula. The town is at the southern end of the municipality of Benito Jurez in the northeast of the state, about 36km south of the resort city of Cancn. The marine terminal at Puerto Morelos is equipped to handle containers and is the largest and most important sea port in the state of Quintana Roo. Puerto Morelos is divided by a highway and a mangrove swamp into three sections. The section west of the highway is known as "Colonia Joaquin Zetina Gazca". The section east of the highway is called "Colonia Pescadores". The section on the coast east of the mangrove swamp is "Puerto" or "Antiguo (old) Puerto Morelos". This original coastal fishing village is now a quiet, mixed-use neighborhood of private homes, hotels, condominiums, restaurants, and tourist shops. The second part is about 2km. inland and adjacent to Highway 307, on the western side. The inland portion is mainly single level dwellings for local workers. It has historically been the main port between the mainland of Yucatn and the Island of Cozumel, and an automobile ferry used to run from Puerto Morelos to Cozumel. The town is named after Independence leader Jos Mara Morelos. Puerto Morelos has grown rapidly with the development of tourism and as of the 2010 census is the home to 9,188 people.[3] Resorts are abundant in the Puerto Morelos region along the Riviera Maya and attractions, such as the Crococun Crocodile Zoo, are also increasing in number. One hundred meters off shore lies the Puerto Morelos portion of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, designated as a National Marine Park due to local environmental activists.
