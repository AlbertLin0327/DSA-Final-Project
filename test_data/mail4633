DHA was originally established in 1936[1] as an amalgamation of 7 Australian pharmaceutical companies. In 1970, DHA was taken over by the British bank Slater Walker.[1] Drug Houses of Australia is now a leading generic pharmaceutics and Chinese proprietary medicine (CPM) manufacturer based in Jurong, Singapore. It was sold to Strides Arcolab through a share purchase agreement with Haw Par Healthcare Limited, Singapore in September 2006 for approximately SGD$19.7 million. It is currently a part of Strides Arcolab which is listed on both the Indian stock exchanges Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE).
