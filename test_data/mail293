Park Square is an area on Rhode Island Route 146A in North Smithfield and Woonsocket, Rhode Island near the intersection of Park Avenue and Route 146A. It is 12 miles from Providence. In the early twentieth century, Park Square was the site of Oak Knoll Farm and the area contained only a diner, a gas station, an amusement park, a trolley barn and fairground. A carnival is still held yearly in the area at a local church, and the Woonsocket High School football team plays on nearby Barry Field. Park Square is currently home to many businesses, including Citizen's Bank, Burger King, Wendy's, McDonald's, Pearl's Candy & Nuts, Ocean State Job Lot, Super Stop & Shop, and Landmark Hospital (built in 1965 as Fogarty Hospital).[1] 1774 Caleb Aldrich milestone on Rt. 146A near Landmark Hospital 2002 photo of the 1774 milestone
