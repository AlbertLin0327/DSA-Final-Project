The RML 64 pounder 64 cwt gun was a Rifled, Muzzle Loading (RML) naval, field or fortification artillery gun manufactured in England in the 19th century[2], which fired a projectile weighing approximately 64 pounds (29kg). "64 cwt" refers to the gun's weight rounded up to differentiate it from other "64-pounder" guns: 1 hundredweight (cwt) = 112 pounds. The calibre of 6.3 inches was chosen to enable it to fire remaining stocks of spherical shells originally made for the obsolete 32pounder guns if necessary. Mark I (adopted in 1864) and Mark II (adopted 1866) guns, and Mark III guns made from 1867 - April 1871 had wrought-iron inner "A" tubes surrounded by wrought-iron coils. Mark III guns made after April 1871 were built with toughened mild steel "A" tubes, and earlier Mark III guns were re-tubed with steel and were classified as a siege gun in land service. Remaining guns with iron tubes were used for sea service.[4] Rifling of all guns consisted of 3 grooves, with a uniform twist of 1 turn in 40 calibres (i.e. 1 turn in 252inches).[4] The gun's standard shell was "common shell", for firing on troops in cover, ships and buildings, weighed 57.4 pounds (26.0kg) when empty with a bursting charge of 7.1 pounds (3.2kg). Shrapnel shells could also be fired; a 66.6 pounds (30.2kg) shell with a 9-ounce (260g) bursting charge propelling 234 metal balls.[5]
