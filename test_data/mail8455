Samuel Edward Shrimski (1828  25 June 1902) was a 19th century Member of Parliament in Otago, New Zealand. He was born in Pozna, Prussia, went to London in 1847, emigrated to Melbourne in 1859 and came to New Zealand in 1861.[1] Shrimski was Mayor of Oamaru for several periods.[1][2] He represented the Waitaki electorate from 1876 to 1881, and then the Oamaru electorate from 1881 to 1885, when he resigned.[3] In the 1884 general election, he defeated Viscount Reidhaven (who later became the Earl of Seafield when he succeeded his father).[2] He was appointed to the Legislative Council on 15 May 1885 and held that role until he died in 1902.[4] He died in Auckland on 25 June 1902.[1]
