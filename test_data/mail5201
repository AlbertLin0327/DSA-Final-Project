The community was originally named Berlin because of the many German settlers. It received a post office in 1852 and was platted in 1857. Due to anti-German sentiments during World War I, the name was changed in 1919 to Marne, to honor those soldiers who fought in the Second Battle of the Marne.[3] However, the name Berlin continues to manifest in many ways, including Berlin Baptist Church, the Berlin Fairgrounds, Berlin Fair Drive and the Berlin Raceway, where Johnny Benson raced. Marne (at the time Berlin) also served as a stop on the historic Grand Rapids, Grand Haven & Muskegon interurban railroad. The depot still remains to this day.
