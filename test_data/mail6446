Coordinates: 513144N 24030W / 51.529N 2.675W / 51.529; -2.675 Chittening is an industrial estate 2 miles north of Avonmouth, Bristol, England on the A403 road, near the River Severn. It lies within the Bristol city boundary. Chittening was once a farm, historically in the parish of Henbury. In the First World War a munitions factory was built on the site, where cylinders and shells were filled with chloropicrin and, from June 1918, with mustard gas.[1] The industrial estate (or "trading estate") developed after the war, under the management of the Port of Bristol Authority. In 1951 a factory producing carbon black was built next to the estate, and operated until 2008 when its closure was announced.[2] Between 1917 and 1964 Chittening was served by Chittening Platform railway station. Chittening was first recorded in 1658 as Chitnend. The name apparently comes from the Middle English chitten ende, meaning "end [of a parish or estate] where there are the young of animals".[3] Chittening Warth is an area of salt marsh beside the Severn Estuary, just to the west of the industrial estate. At low tide the mudflats there are visited by large numbers of birds, including Dunlin, Eurasian Curlew, Eurasian Oystercatcher, Common Redshank and Whimbrel. In some winters there are large populations of field voles, which attract Short-eared Owls.[4] Chittening is served by St Andrews Road railway station. The following suburbs are in the same urban area, but lie in South Gloucestershire:
