Tig'rr is a classic steel roller coaster located at Indiana Beach. It is Indiana Beach's second roller coaster, and is one of only a few roller coasters built entirely on a pre-existing building. it has a maximum speed of 49 miles per hour (79km/h) and is 39 feet (12m) tall. It is one of only a handful of Anton Schwarzkopf "Jet Star" models still operating, and the only one still operating in North America. Of all the six coasters at Indiana Beach, Tig'rr is the only one with a height restriction of 54" height. That is because of the extreme turns the coaster takes. Tig'rr used to not run with any restraints, but retractable seat belts have since been added.
