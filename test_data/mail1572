Harri Olli (born January 15, 1985 in Rovaniemi) is a Finnish former ski jumper who has been competing on World Cup level since 2002. He is best known for his silver medal in the individual large hill at the 2007 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Sapporo. Olli has a total of four Continental Cup wins in the individual normal hill during 2005-06. Before the FIS Ski-Flying World Championships 2008 competition in Oberstdorf Olli had had a night out in a bar.[1] Indeed his both jumps were over 200 metres which gave him the sixth place in the final results. In August 2008 Olli was dismissed them from the national team for the second time. He had been drunk during the Summer Grand Prix tour in Central Europe and was late for the ride to the competition venue next morning.[2] In July the police caught Olli for drunk driving and heavy speeding near Lapinlahti.[1] Olli won one competition and placed third in another during the Summer tour. Olli took his first World Cup win in Oberstdorf on February 14, 2009 with both jumps over 200 metres. He has since won two more World Cup events, both in early 2009. Olli again had alcohol-related problems before the opening of the World Cup season 2009/2010. He was having a dispute with his fiance in a bar room and a drinking glass was used as a striking weapon.[3] His 2009/2010 season has been characterized by sporadic bouts of good form. For much of the early season he maintained a position in the pre-qualified top 10 but unfortunately as his performance curve dipped and he dropped outside the pre-qualified places sometimes he did not qualify at all, something that seemed less to do with talent and more to do with attitude. Upon questioning by British Eurosport commentator David Goldstrom, the Finnish Coach Janne Vtinen stated that Olli's apparent disinterest stemmed more from 'frustration' and shyness than a bad attitude to ski jumping.[4] The Finnish Team maintains faith in his ability and talent and during the 2010 Vancouver Olympics Olli competed in all three events, although he was disqualified in the Normal Hill Event due to a suit violation. In the large Hill event Olli placed 18th, the highest ranking Finn, after a poor first effort and the disqualification of Janne Happonen and Janne Ahonen's knee injury.[5] In the Team Event Olli acted as anchorman in place of Ahonen improving under the weight of responsibility and making two very good and consistent efforts. Unfortunately, due to a sudden flurry of good form for the Norwegian's Finland placed just outside the medals but it was tightly fought final round.[6] In the Winter 2009-2010 season Olli was 14th overall, 13th in the Ski-Flying Standings, 12th in the Four Hills Tournament and 11th in the Nordic Tour.[7] In the 2010 Summer Grand Prix Olli was 11th overall.[8] On Sunday November 28, 2010 Olli was suspended by the FIS for one competition after giving the Media camera the middle finger after his poor qualification jump of 77 m which left him in 57th place. Subsequently the Finnish Ski Association suspended Olli from the National Team for a undisclosed period of time. This is now the third time in as many years that Olli has been suspended from the National team.[9] Pekka Niemel stated in an after-incident interview that Olli had 'personal problems' but there has been online speculation that Olli feels he was 'thrown under the bus' by the Jury's decision to make him jump despite the bad wind conditions, conditions which the wind and gate compensation system did not seem able to adequately compensate.[10] It is unclear what form Olli is in coming into the 2010-2011 season, fans can only hope that he'll find some confidence in his own performance. Olli is a student of Mathematics at the University of Rovaniemi, though his place of residence is Lahti with his fiance. In an interview with the FIS Ski-Jumping site, Olli stated that he had 'no goals' for the 2010-2011 season but that to be an 'all-round happy athlete' he would have to 'jump well'. When asked whether he was certain that the season would be successful Olli replied 'I'm not sure about that.' [11]
