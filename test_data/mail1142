John Wozniak's first effort, Zog BogBean - From the Marcy Playground, was self-produced and recorded in his bedroom studio with some help from his then-girlfriend Sherry Fraser and her brother, Scott. A small run of CDs were self-released by Wozniak, and they remain extremely difficult to find to this day. "Our Generation" and "Dog And His Master" would appear on later Marcy Playground albums. As of April 2009, Zog Bogbean is available for download at Marcy Playground's official site as well as other outlets such as iTunes. All songs written and composed by John Wozniak, except where noted.
