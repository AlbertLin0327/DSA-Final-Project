La Vista High School is a continuation high school located in Fullerton, California. As such, it is a high school for 16- to 18-year-old Fullerton Joint Union High School District students who, in most cases, have not made satisfactory progress toward graduation at one of the comprehensive high schools. Students are usually referred to La Vista High School by one of the traditional high schools because they are short of credits in required courses, have poor attendance record, or have not adjusted well to the academic and/or behavioral expectations of the traditional high school. It shares the same campus as Troy High School.
