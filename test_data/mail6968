Sean na gCannai  Labhra, aka Sean O'Lowry, Irish criminal, fl. 1820's/1830's.  Labhra was a native of Connemara, and a professional criminal. He was an associate of Liam Dearg  Mainnn of Loch an Ghadai in Derrycunlagh, Connemara. He eventually murdered  Mainnn and hid his body for a time in his own house. A neighbouring child apparently saw the murder being committed, but feigned ignorance in case  Labhra killed her too. He is said to have eventually been arrested by local landlord, Thomas Barnwall Martin of nearby Ballinahinch.
