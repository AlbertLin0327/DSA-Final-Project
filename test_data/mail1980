Out West (Live at the Fillmore) is a live double album released by Gomez in June 2005 and the first album the band released for ATO Records. It features material mostly from their first two albums, Bring It On and Liquid Skin, with a few tracks each from In Our Gun and Split the Difference, and one from the Machismo E.P.. There are also a few cover songs, such as "Going Out West" by Tom Waits and "Black Eyed Dog" by Nick Drake (which is combined with "Free to Run" in an extended song). The front album cover is a psychedelic manipulation of a photograph of a traditional Mexican band, probably[citation needed] inspired by the Fillmore's tradition of using psychedelic posters to promote events. The back album cover shows the actual band Gomez in similar outfits. All songs written by Gomez except where indicated. The UK edition of the album, released on Independiente, comes with a bonus DVD.
