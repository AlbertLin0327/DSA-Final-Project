Thomas Ford Democratic Augustus C. French Democratic The Illinois gubernatorial election of 1842 was the eighth quadrennial election for this office. Democrat Augustus C. French defeated Whig nominee Thomas M. Kilpatrick,for the office. Independent Richard Eels came in a distant third. The term was cut short, and lasted only half the normal length. This synchronized the gubernatorial election with the election for President. This was the first time in the history of the state that a governor was re-elected, though governor Joseph Duncan attempted this and failed. 1996  2000  2004  2008 Democratic: 2008 Republican: 2008  2012 1966  1972  1978  1980  1984  1986  1990 1992  1996  1998  2002  2004  2008  2010 1st district, 2000 2006 (6th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 19th) 2008  2010  2012 14th district, 2008  5th district, 2009 1818  1822  1826  1830  1834  1838  1842 1846  1848  1852  1856  1986  1994  1998 2002  2006  2010 House 2008  Senate 2008  House 2010  Senate 2010 2011 1997  2001  2005  2009 2001  2003  2005  2007  2009  2011
