Annepona mariae is a species of sea snail, a cowry, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Cypraeidae, the cowries.[1] The oval, porcellaneous shell is 9-20 mm in size. It is white in color with small yellow or olive blotches in a ring on the dorsum and on the sides. The extremities of the shell are hardly produced. This species occurs from eastern Africa to northern Australia, the Philippines, the central Pacific Ocean, including the Solomons, Tonga, Hawaii and the Tuamotu Archipelago. [2]
