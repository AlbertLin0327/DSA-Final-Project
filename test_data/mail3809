The Taipei Metro Taipei City Hall Station is located in the Xinyi District of Taipei, Taiwan. It is a station on the Nangang Line (Blue Line). The station is an underground structure with an island platform and four exits. The size of the station is larger than most other stations on the Nangang Line.[2] The station is situated under Zhongxiao East Road, between Keelung Road and Songren Road. Washrooms are located outside of the fare area of the station. Due to crowding during New Year's festivities, automatic platform gates have been installed at this station.[3][4] In recent years, the station has gone through renovations to connect it with a bus transfer station, mall, and hotel above.[5] The Taipei City Hall Bus Station opened for service on August 5, 2010.[6] In February 2009, a 105.3m (345ft)-long vegetal wall was unveiled at the station for a two-month exhibition. It was expected to absorb 35.445kg (78.14lb) of carbon dioxide while releasing 26.094kg (57.53lb) of oxygen.[7] Numerous pieces of public art are situated in and around the station. A series of five sculptures (titled "Growth") are placed around the station.[8] "Furrows" and "Push" (granite/marble) are located in entrance square, while "Sprout", "Twist", and "Sway" (bronze/aluminum statues) are located on the station platform. Because the station is underneath Zhongxiao East Road and nearby the newly-developed Xinyi District, the Taipei City Hall Station is one of the most widely used station in the Taipei Metro. In 2008, the station handled 86,967 passengers (entries/exits) per day.[9] Since the opening of the Taipei City Hall Bus Station, daily ridership increased during November 2010 to 116,400,[10] becoming the second-busiest station, only behind Taipei Main Station. Due to the large crowd during weekends and rush hours, the parallel Xinyi Line is being constructed to disperse some of the crowds. To cope with crowds during New Year's Eve celebrations, designated trains pass through the station without stopping.[11] The station is also a transit station for local and long distance buses to Neihu, Sanchong, Xinzhuang, Luzhou, Jingmei, Muzha, and to Keelung, Taoyuan, Zhongli, Miaoli, Taichung, etc. A large bus transit terminal was constructed between the space of Exit 1 and the United Daily News Office. The station also provides free shuttle bus transport to the Taipei 101 Financial Center and to the World Trade Center during major exhibitions.
