Seth (Richard Gutierrez) is a rich, impulsive playboy who runs away from serious relationships and doesnt give much thought to the women he goes out with. Sophia (KC Concepcion) is a prude, ambitious girl who feels responsible for the tragedy she once encountered and with a scar to constantly remind her about this unfortunate experience. When the two accidentally meet in Santorini, their differences did not stop them from spending one unforgettable summer together  that is until Seth runs away again, scared of the unusual feeling that is happening within him. Seth soon realizes his mistake and comes back to Manila to try his best to regain Pia's affection.
