Carl Barron (born 11 June 1964) is an Australian comedian. His style is based on observational humour. He was born in Longreach, Queensland, the son of a sheep shearer, and formerly worked as an apprentice roof tiler. Barron has released three DVDs, entitled Carl Barron LIVE!, Carl Barron: Whatever Comes Next and Carl Barron: Walking Down The Street. In November 2010 a box set entitled "All The Stuff I've Done So Far" was released, which included the three previous titles, plus a documentary and outtakes.[1] In 1993 he was voted 'Comic of the Year'[2] and 'Best Up and Coming Talent' and has since made many TV appearances in commercials and on shows such as Rove and Thank God You're Here. Barron made his first television appearance on the NRL Footy Show on the 17th of April, 1997.[3] One of his perpetual jokes is that several people have mistaken him for people such as Australian musician Paul Kelly. He once stated "I reckon if Paul Kelly and Gandhi had a baby, I'd be it!".[4] He has regularly sold-out shows at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival.[3] Barron has been very successful in Australia with the DVD release of Carl Barron LIVE! going four times platinum, making it the most successful Australian comedy DVD in Australian history.[5] He has appeared in Good News Week, Out of the Question, Thank God You're Here and several episodes of Rove.
