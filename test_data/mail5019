Ulmus glaucescens var. lasiocarpa Rehder, named the Hairy-fruited Glaucescent Elm in the USA, is found along rivers and mountain slopes at elevations between 2500 m - 2600 m in the provinces of Hebei, Henan, Liaoning, Nei Mongol, Ningxia, eastern Qinghai, and Shanxi. The variety is distinguished by a "samara densely pubescent when young, with scattered hairs when mature. Fl. and fr. March - May.".[1] The tree was heavily damaged by the Elm Leaf Beetle Xanthogaleruca luteola in trials in Oklahoma [2]. There are no known cultivars of this taxon, nor is it known to be in commerce.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
