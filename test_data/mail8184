Content:
The Grand Prix Charles-Lopold Mayer (Charles-Lopold Mayer Prize) is awarded annually by the Acadmie des Sciences (French Academy of Sciences) de l'Institut de France (the French Institute) to researchers who have performed outstanding work in the biological sciences; especially in the areas of cell or molecular biology. Citizens or residents of any nation are eligible for the prize, but it is never awarded to individuals of the same nation two years in a row, nor is the prize ever presented to scholars who are more than 65 years of age. Between the first presentation of the award in 1961 and the year 2009, there have been more than 60 laureates, eleven of whom subsequently received the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology, or in Chemistry.
