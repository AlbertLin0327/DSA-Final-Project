Lincoln Community Health Center (LCHC) is a primary care facility located in Durham, North Carolina since opening its doors as Lincoln Community Hospital in 1901. LCHC offers a wide range of health services including adult medicine, pediatrics, dental, social work/mental health services, family care nursing and outreach into the home. Prenatal and family planning services are available at the Center in cooperation with the Durham County Health Department. The Duke family financed the construction of Lincoln Hospital in 1901, as a facility dedicated to the treatment of Durham's African-American citizens. It served as the primary African-American hospital in Durham until 1976, when it was restructured into the Lincoln Community Health Center and transferred its inpatient services to Durham County General Hospital as part of a 1968 referrendum that also saw the closure of Watts Hospital, Durham's predominantly white healthcare facility.[1][2] Coordinates: 355850N 785352W / 35.9806N 78.8978W / 35.9806; -78.8978
