In addition to Hairspray, Wittman conceived, wrote lyrics for, and directed Martin Short: Fame Becomes Me and conceived and directed Matters of the Heart, a solo concert by Patti LuPone. At the present time, the partners are working on Catch Me If You Can, a musical adaptation of the 2002 Steven Spielberg film, together with Terrence McNally.[1] In 2011, Hairspray was performed at Nanuet Senior High School, where Whitman attended high school.
