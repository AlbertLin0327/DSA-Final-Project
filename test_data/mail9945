At its time it was the flagship model of the mobile XPS series. It had the portability of a laptop, but the form factor of an all-in-one desktop. The XPS M2010 could be folded into briefcase form factor and carried anywhere the user desired (the arm bolstering the display doubled as a handle). Although at 18.3lbs, it was considerably heavy to be a laptop replacement. The XPS M2010 has support for dual hard drives. It has 8 surround sound speakers with an integrated subwoofer below the display. The laptop shipped with a detachable Bluetooth keyboard with an integrated touchpad. The XPS M2010 was configurable with Core 2 Duo T5600 (1.86GHz, 2 MB L2 cache, 667MHz FSB), T7200 (2GHz, 4 MB L2 cache, 667MHz FSB), T7400 (2.16GHz, 4 MB L2 cache, 677MHz FSB) and T7600 (2.33GHz, 4 MB L2 cache, 667MHz FSB) and Memory was upgradable to a maximum 4 GBof DDR2 SDRAM @ 667MHz. The laptop originally sold for over $3000 depending on configuration.
