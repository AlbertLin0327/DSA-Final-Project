The following shows the public housing estates in Tsz Wan Shan, Wong Tai Sin District, Kowloon, Hong Kong. Tsz Wan Shan, or Temple Hill, was located at the north of Wong Tai Sin. There was a resettlement estate called Tsz Wan Shan Resettlement Estate (Chinese: ) in 1960s. It was the largest resettlement estate in Hong Kong. It consisted of totally 63 blocks (including Mark III, IV, V, VI type blocks) with population of 146,000. The block design of the estate was different from that of Shek Kip Mei Resettlement Estate, with room access from the internal corridor. Each room had its own private balcony, water tap and toilet.[1] In 1980, the estate was split into Tsz Lok Estate, Tsz Oi Estate, Tsz Ching Estate, Tsz Man Estate and Tsz On Estate.[2] In 1985, Blocks 40, 61 to 65 were found to have structural problems by the Hong Kong Housing Authority.[3] All the blocks were demolished between 1980s and 1990s, and replaced by new blocks of Tsz On Court, Tsz Lok Estate, Tsz Oi Court, Tsz Ching Estate, Tsz Man Estate and Tsz Hong Estate.[4][5] Shatin Pass Estate (Chinese: ) was a public housing estate in Sha Tin Pass, Tsz Wan Shan.
