Coordinates: 410358N 450124E / 41.06611N 45.02333E / 41.06611; 45.02333 Yuxar skipara (also, Okari-Eskipara and Yukhary Askipara  meaning "Upper Askipara") is a village in the Qazakh Rayon of Azerbaijan. Together with Aa skipara ("Lower Askipara"), it forms an exclave of Azerbaijan. The exclave is surrounded by Armenia and has been controlled by it since the Nagorno-Karabakh War. The entire exclave is about 37 square kilometers. Today, the village is mostly inhabited by Armenians as the Armenian army expelled its Azerbaijani population after it occupied the territory. It is part of Tavush Province since this occupation.
