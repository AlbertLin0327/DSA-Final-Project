This is a list of television shows set in the Greater Los Angeles area (including Los Angeles and Orange County communities such as Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Malibu, and Newport Beach). The fact that many American TV shows are made at Hollywood studios means that the Greater Los Angeles area is often the cheapest and most convenient location in which to set a program (series filmed entirely inside a studio excepted).
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
