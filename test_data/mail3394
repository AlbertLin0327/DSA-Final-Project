The Powerpuff Girls video games are a series of action, platformer games based on Cartoon Network's cartoon series, Powerpuff Girls. They were published by BAM! Entertainment. The Powerpuff Girls: Bad Mojo Jojo was developed by Sennari Interactive for the Game Boy Color. It was released in North America on November 14, 2000.[1] Bad Mojo Jojo follows Blossom, the leader of the Powerpuff Girls, as she fights Mojo Jojo and his henchmen. Blossom can fly, but only for a short period of time. GameSpot cites this as a key problem, as whenever Blossom falls into water, she not only dies, but any progress in collecting required trinkets throughout the level is reset to nothing.[2] Another aspect of the game is that the player takes the role of Bubbles, Buttercup, Rowdyruff Boys Brick, Boomer, Butch, and the Mayor of Townsville through the use of entering passwords, which can also be used to unlock special features like unlimited flight. The Powerpuff Girls: Paint the Townsville Green was developed by Sennari Interactive for the Game Boy Color. It was released in North America on November 28, 2000.[3] Unlike the previous game, this installment follows Buttercup. The game plays very similar to the first one, for the sake of being able to trade cards between the two games when they're linked together. The Powerpuff Girls: Battle HIM was developed by Sennari Interactive for the Game Boy Color. It was released in North America on February 27, 2001.[4] Unlike the other two games, Battle HIM follows Bubbles, and plays very similar to the first two, for the sake of being able to trade cards between the three when two are linked together. The Powerpuff Girls: Chemical X-traction was developed by VIS Entertainment. It was released in North America for the Nintendo 64 (N64) on October 14, 2001, and for the PlayStation on November 8, 2001. The Powerpuff Girls must battle enemies in a variety of settings in order to reclaim Chemical X and track down Mojo Jojo. Players can play the story mode or can battle against a friend in a head-to-head battle. In the story mode, players can pick up objects and throw them at an enemy to decrease their opponents health meter. They can use superpowered attacks by collecting vials of Chemical X. If the player successfully defeats the enemy in two out of three rounds, they move to the next enemy location.
