The 201112 Gold Coast United season will be Gold Coast United's third and final season in the A-League. On the 23 September 2011, it was announced the club would start a youth academy consisting of 22 players who missed out on a place in the NYL squad. It has been speculated that the aim of this project is to address issues of community engagement.[1] Note: Flags indicate national team as has been defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.
