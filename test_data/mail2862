Rodney Stich (1923) is an United States citizen, a former Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) investigator (1962 1968) and an author. According to Burnett "his work led him to believe that there was major corruption at the heart of the aviation business. His "whistle-blowing" campaign was carried out for over 30 years, in which he filed his own "federal actions" in courts throughout the United States. His book Unfriendly Skies (1968) led to a "tale of Job-like proportions in which Stich deggedly filed private lawsuits against the FAA and eventually lost his business, money, home, and ultimately his liberty." He was imprisoned in 1986 for six months under charges of contempt of court.[1] The International Currency Review considers that Stich was a pioneer in exposing the crimes committed by the United States government and their concealment. Stich suffered harassment, was put in jail and destroyed financially by the United States federal government and its agents. The United States Federal government action was similar to that of the then USSR's persecution of its opponents.[2] The website www.defraudingamerica.com carries a list of the books that Stich has authored. The page is titled Documentary Books by Professional Insiders On Worldwide Intrigue by U.S. Leaders[3]
