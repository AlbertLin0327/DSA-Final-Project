Line 2 of the Nanjing Metro (Chinese: 2; pinyin: Nnjng Dti r Ho Xin) is a subway line that runs mainly in an east-west direction on the Nanjing Metro network in China. This line entered operation on May 28, 2010. [1] It covers a length of 37.95 km with 26 stations.[2] 18 stations are underground and the other 8 station are either ground or elevated stations. The section between Maqun Station and Jingtianlu Station was originally planned as an east extension of Line 2, but it entered operation, together with the main line, on the same day. [3] The Zijinshan Station () of the Huhanrong Passenger Dedicated Line and the ShanghaiNanjing Intercity High-Speed Railway (on its branch going to the new Nanjing South Railway Station, rather than the one to the Nanjing Railway Station) will be located next to Jinmalu Station.[4] Maqun Bus Station, with services to a few cities east of Nanjing, is located near Maqun Station.[5]
