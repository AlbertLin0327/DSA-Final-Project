A Graduate Diploma is generally a postgraduate qualification, although some graduate diplomas involve the study of undergraduate level courses (see Postgraduate diploma). The diploma is normally taken following a Bachelor's degree and a successful award allows progression to a Masters Degree without having received Honours with the Bachelor's Degree. More recently, post-graduate diplomas have become more popular, as they allow graduate-level specialization studies to be completed in half the time of a masters, while still being transferable into a masters degree in the same topic. All of this at half the price of a masters degreeusually between $10,000 and $15,000 for the graduate diploma, as opposed to $20,000 or more for a masters degree. In addition, these diplomas allow one to try specializations such as accounting, without committing the time and money to a full masters degree in the same specialization. Alternatively, it is possible to complete a graduate diploma, start working in the field, and have the company pay for additional courses to attain a masters degree in the same topic later-on (on a part-time basis for instance), there-by saving money and time.

On a similar note, postgraduate students can study various Graduate Diploma in England and Wales. For example, the law conversion course. However, such courses may be referred to as either a Graduate Diploma or a Postgraduate Diploma. Different institutions offering exactly the same course appear inconsistent in which name they use. Perhaps an indication is given by the following example. In 2003, The College of Law renamed the official title for its law conversion course from Postgraduate Diploma in Law, to Graduate Diploma in Law. The reasons given were that although the law conversion course is studied postgraduately, the contents of the course are only undergraduate in nature, albeit condensed in time.
