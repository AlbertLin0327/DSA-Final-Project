Kittanning Gap is a gap at the summit of Allegheny Ridge[citation needed] in central Pennsylvania in the United States. It is located in Logan Township, approximately 5mi (8km) west of Altoona. In the 18th century the Kittanning Path passed through the gap, providing a route between central and western Pennsylvania for Native Americans and early white settlers. It was later selected as the site for a railroad line across the Allegheny Mountains. The challenge of constructing a railroad through the ridge led to the construction of the unique Horseshoe Curve in 1854, now designated as a National Historic Landmark.
