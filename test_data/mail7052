The 2009 Izu Islands earthquake (2009) occurred on August 9, 2009 at 19:55 local time (10:55 UTC) near the Izu Islands, off the south coast of Honshu, Japan. The epicenter was 170 km from Hamamatsu and 325 km from Tokyo.[1] This was an intraplate earthquake within the Pacific Plate, which is subducting beneath the Philippine Sea Plate at the Izu-Bonin trench in this region. In Tokyo, the intensity reached shindo 4[2] (MM IV according to USGS). There was a region of abnormal seismic intensity along the Pacific coast close to the Japan Trench, in which the seismic intensity was greater than that observed in the region closer to the epicenter.[3] Due to its depth of 297 km, this earthquake did not cause any damage.[4]
