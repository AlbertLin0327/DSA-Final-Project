Content:
A Day in the Life is an album by Jane Siberry, released in 1997. It was the second release on her own Sheeba Records label after leaving Reprise. It is not a conventional album of songs, but a sound collage of yoga classes, phone messages, conversations, street sounds, and includes a wide cast of characters including cab drivers, and artists like Patty Larkin, Joe Jackson, k. d. lang, and Darol Anger, as well as excerpts from several songs.
