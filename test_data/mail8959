Stress is a prominent feature of the English language, both at the level of the word (lexical stress) and at the level of the phrase or sentence (prosodic stress). Absence of stress on a syllable, or on a word in some cases, is frequently associated in English with vowel reduction  many such syllables are pronounced with a centralized vowel (schwa) or with certain other vowels that are described as being "reduced" (or sometimes with a syllabic consonant as the syllable nucleus rather than a vowel). Various phonological analyses exist for these phenomena. Lexical stress (word stress) is regarded as being phonemic in English; the position of the stress is generally unpredictable and can serve to distinguish words. For example, the words insight and incite are distinguished in pronunciation only by the fact that the stress is placed on the first syllable in the former word, and on the second syllable in the latter. Similarly, the noun and the verb increase are distinguished by the placement of the stress in the same way  this is an example of an initial-stress-derived noun. Some words are shown in dictionaries as having two levels of stress: primary and secondary. For example, the RP pronunciation of organization may be given as /gnazen/, with primary stress on the fourth syllable, secondary stress on the first syllable, and the remaining syllables unstressed. For different ways of analysing levels of stress in English, see Degrees of lexical stress below. English also has relatively strong prosodic stress, whereby particular words within a phrase or sentence are given additional stress in order to place emphasis on the information that they convey. There is also said to be a natural "tonic stress" which falls on the last stressed syllable of a prosodic unit  this is addressed in the section on Degrees of lexical stress below. English is classed as a stress-timed language, which means that there is a tendency to speak so that the stressed syllables come at roughly equal intervals. See Isochrony. Certain vowel sounds in English are associated strongly with absence of stress: they occur practically exclusively in unstressed syllables; and conversely, most (though not all) unstressed syllables contain one of these sounds. These are known as reduced vowels, and tend to be characterized by such features as shortness, laxness and central position. The exact set of reduced vowels depends on dialect and speaker; the principal ones are described in the sections below. Schwa is the most common reduced vowel in English. It may be denoted orthographically by any of the vowel letters, as the a in about, the e in synthesis, the o in harmony, the u in medium, the i in decimal and the y in syringe (although the last two are pronounced as a near-close vowel by some speakers  see the following section). In many rhotic dialects, an r-colored schwa, [], occurs in words such as water and standard (non-rhotic dialects simply have schwa in these positions). The r-colored schwa can be analyzed phonemically as /r/. In some dialects of English there is a distinction between two vowel heights of reduced vowels: in addition to schwa, there is a distinct near-close central unrounded vowel [] (or equivalently []). In the British phonetic tradition, the latter vowel is represented with the symbol //, and in the American tradition //.[1] An example of a minimal pair contrasting these two reduced vowels is Rosas vs. roses: the a in Rosa's is a schwa, while the e in roses (for speakers who make the distinction) is the near-close vowel. Among speakers who make this distinction, the distributions of schwa and [] are quite variable, and in many cases the two are in free variation: the i in decimal, for example, may be pronounced with either sound. A symbolization convention recently introduced by Oxford University Press for some of their English dictionaries[2] [3] uses the non-IPA "compound" symbol [] () in words that may be pronounced with either [] or schwa. For example, the word noted may be represented [ntd]. The final vowel of words like happy and coffee is a reduced front close unrounded vowel most commonly represented with [i], although some dialects (including more traditional Received Pronunciation) may have []. This [i] used to be identified with the phoneme /i/, as in FLEECE. [4][5] See happY-tensing. However, contemporary accounts regard it as a symbol representing a close front vowel that is neither the vowel of KIT nor that of FLEECE; it occurs in contexts where the contrast between these vowels is neutralized [6] [7] [8]; these contexts include unstressed prevocalic position within the word, such as react [rikt]. Strictly speaking, therefore, [i] is not a phoneme but an archiphoneme. (See Phonological history of English high front vowels.) Many dialects also retain rounding in reduced vowels. The vowels /u/ and // may reduce to [] (or equivalently []), as in into [nt].[9] The diphthong /o/ may reduce to [], as in widow [wd]: Bolinger (1989) cites a three-way contrast, a mission [mn], emission [mn], and omission [mn]. Analogously to the [] symbol mentioned above, Oxford University Press have devised the non-IPA symbol [] to represent a vowel which may be either // or //, the two being in free variation.[10]. For example awful [fl] may be pronounced /fl/ or /fl/. A rounded vowel [u], corresponding to the [i] happY vowel, is widely used in British works[11] [12] for words such as influence [nfluns], into [ntu]. Phonologically, this vowel is an archiphoneme representing the neutralization of /u/ and //. The other sounds that can serve as the peak of reduced syllables are the syllabic consonants. When these occur, there is a syllable with no vowel. The consonants that can be syllabic in English are principally /l/, /m/ and /n/. For example the le in cycle and bottle may be a syllabic /l/, the m in prism may be a syllabic /m/, and the on in prison may be a syllabic /n/. A syllabic consonant may be analyzed phonologically either as just the consonant, or as consisting of an underlying schwa followed by the consonant. For example, cycle may be phonemized as either /sakl/ or /sakl/. A syllabic [] can also be heard in some positions, for example in the word and in the phrase lock and key, spoken rapidly. In many phonological approaches, and in many dictionaries, English is represented as having two levels of stress: primary and secondary. In every lexical word, and in some grammatical words, one syllable is identified as having primary stress, though in monosyllables the stress is not generally marked. In addition, longer words may have one or more syllables identified as having secondary stress. Syllables that have neither are called unstressed. Secondary stress is frequently indicated in the following cases: Note that this last-mentioned group of syllables are those which are ascribed tertiary stress in the approach described in the next section. In some theories, English has been described as having three levels of stress: primary, secondary, and tertiary (in addition to the unstressed level, which in this approach may also be called quaternary stress). For example, our examples would be coun.ter.in.tel.li.gence and coun.ter.foil. Exact treatments vary, but it is common for tertiary stress to be assigned to those syllables which, while not assigned primary or secondary stress, nonetheless contain full vowels (unreduced vowels, i.e. those which are not among the reduced vowels listed in the previous section). Dictionaries do not generally mark tertiary stress, but as mentioned above, some of them treat all syllables with unreduced vowels as having at least secondary stress. Phoneticians such as Peter Ladefoged have noted that it is possible to describe English with only one degree of stress, as long as unstressed syllables are phonemically distinguished for vowel reduction.[15] According to this view, the posited multiple levels, whether primarysecondary or primarysecondarytertiary, are mere phonetic detail and not true phonemic stress. They report that often the alleged secondary (or tertiary) stress in English is not characterized by the increase in respiratory activity normally associated with primary stress in English or with all stress in other languages. In their analysis, an English syllable may be either stressed or unstressed, and if unstressed, the vowel may be either full or reduced. This is all that is required for a phonemic treatment. The difference between what is normally called primary and secondary stress, in this analysis, is explained by the observation that the last stressed syllable in a normal prosodic unit receives additional intonational or "tonic" stress. Since a word spoken in isolation, in citation form (as for example when a lexicographer determines which syllables are stressed) acquires this additional tonic stress, it may appear to be inherent in the word itself rather than derived from the utterance in which the word is spoken. (The tonic stress may also occur elsewhere than on the final stressed syllable, if the speaker uses contrasting or other prosody.) This combination of lexical stress, phrase- or clause-final prosody, and the lexical reduction of some unstressed vowels, conspires to create the impression of multiple levels of stress. In Ladefoged's approach, our examples are transcribed phonemically as cunterintlligence /kantr.ntldns/, with two stressed syllables, and cunterfoil /kantrfl/, with one. In citation form, or at the end of a prosodic unit (marked []), extra stress appears from the utterance that is not inherent in the words themselves: cunterintlligence [kantr.ntldns] and cunterfoil [kantrfl]. To determine where the actual lexical stress is in a word, one may try pronouncing the word in a phrase, with other words before and after it and without any pauses between them, to eliminate the effects of tonic stress: in the cunterintlligence commnity, for example, one can hear secondary (that is, lexical) stress on two syllables of counterintelligence, as the primary (tonic) stress has shifted to community. The following table summarizes the relationships between the aforementioned analyses of levels of stress in English: Ladefoged's binary account (which recognizes only one level of lexical stress), a quaternary account (which recognizes primary, secondary and tertiary stress), and typical dictionary approaches (which recognize primary and secondary stress, although their interpretations of secondary stress vary). As described in the section above, the binary account explains the distinction observed between "primary" and "secondary" stress as resulting from the prosodic, tonic stress that naturally falls on the final stressed syllable in a unit. It also recognizes the distinction between unstressed (otherwise called tertiary stressed) syllables with full vowels, and unstressed syllables with reduced vowels, but considers this to be a difference involving vowel reduction and not one of stress. The vowels and diphthongs //, /a/, and // are never reduced,[dubious  discuss] and all full (unreduced) vowels may occur in unstressed position, especially in compound words. (These are often transcribed in dictionaries as having secondary stress, but that is a convention for full vowels that occur after the primary stress. See secondary stress.) In English compounds, the second word typically loses its stress without reduction, though in highly frequent compounds it may reduce as well. Nonetheless, some vowels, such as //, reduce quite readily, so that there are few English words that have them in unstressed positions. One of the effects of vowel reduction is the partial loss of voicing distinctions in preceding consonants. With a full vowel, as in manatee, an unvoiced consonant is typically aspirated: [mnti]. However, with a reduced vowel, as in humanity, aspiration is lost and the consonant may even become partially voiced. In American English, for the case of /t/, it may also be flapped: [hjmni].[17] According to Wells (1990), in the absence of morpheme boundaries or phonotactical constraints, a consonant between a full and a reduced vowel generally belongs to the syllable with the full vowel, whereas a consonant between two reduced vowels belongs to a first syllable.[18] According to this analysis, manatee is /mn..ti/ and humanity is /hj.mn.t.i/; voiceless stops are only aspirated at the beginning of syllables, and /t/ can only be flapped at the end of a syllable: compare might I /mat.a/  [ma] and my tie /ma.ta/  [mata]. Vowel reduction occurs with varying degrees of stability. In some words, an unstressed vowel is never reduced, and in some it is always reduced, but in a large number the extent of reduction depends on how quickly or carefully the speaker enunciates the word. For example, the o in obscene may be pronounced either as full [] or as reduced [], but the historical o sound in gallon is never a full vowel, no matter how carefully one enunciates.[17] Many English grammatical (function) words alternate between having full but unstressed vowels and reduced vowels, depending on context. For example, the is typically /i/ before a vowel-initial word (the apple) but // before a consonant-initial word (the pear), though this distinction is being lost in the United States.[15] Similarly with to: to America /tu/ vs. to Britain /t/. Most words, however, alternate depending on how much emphasis they are accorded. When stress shifts to the word, the vowel must be full. Some of these are:[15] and so on with a, at, would, that, has, etc. There are also a number of English verb-adjective pairs that are distinguished solely by vowel reduction. For example, in some dialects, separate as a verb (as in 'what separates nation from nation') has a full final vowel, [spret], whereas the corresponding adjective (as in 'they sleep in separate rooms') has a reduced vowel: [sprt][19] or [sprt].[20]
