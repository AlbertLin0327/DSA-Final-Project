Golden Wonder is a late maincrop russet skinned variety of potato. It is very dry and floury and is ideal for baking, roasting, frying but is completely unsuitable for boiling, as it will disintegrate in the boiling water as it cooks. The potato was originally found in the UK, by a Mr. Brown of Arbroath, Scotland in 1906. It is a periclinal chimera with an outer layer of the variety Golden Wonder and an inner core of the variety Langworthy [1] Unfortunately, yields of this potato tend to be on the low side. Although they can be susceptible to some diseases, slug and blight resistance are reasonable. Because of the good keeping qualities, and very good taste (and in fact it is said[by whom?] to be better 2 months after lifting), they are well worth growing. The crisp company Golden Wonder was named after the potato.
