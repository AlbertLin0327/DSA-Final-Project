Nuno Mendes or Nuno II (?-1071) was the last Count of Portugal from the family of Vmara Peres. The son of Count Mendo Nunes, his desires for greater autonomy for Portugal led him to face King Garcia II of Galicia and claim the title of King of Portugal in 1070. In the January 18th 1071 he fought in the Battle of Pedroso, near the Monastery of Tibes, and his defeat and death led the winning Garcia II to call himself King of Galicia and Portugal. The County of Portugal was then subsumed into the crowns of Galicia and Len until regranted by King Alfonso VI of Len and Castile a quarter-century later.
