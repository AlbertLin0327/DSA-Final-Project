Maride was a castle or fortified town in Mesopotamia, mentioned by Ammianus Marcellinus (Ammian. xviii. 6), in his account of Constantius II. Maride is the same as the present Mardin, Turkey, which is seated on a considerable eminence looking southward over the plains of Mesopotamia. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
