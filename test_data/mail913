Jeff Stoughton (born July 26, 1963) is a Canadian curler. Stoughton is a three-time Brier champion and two-time World champion as skip. Stoughton's first national championship came in 1988 when he won the Canadian Mixed Curling Championship. He won the mixed once again in 1991. 1991 was the same year Stoughton attended his first Brier. His team of Dave Iverson, Ken Tresoor and Garry VanDenBerghe finished 6-5. Five years later, at the 1996 Labatt Brier, Stoughton and his team of Tresoor, VanDenBerghe, and Steve Gould went all the way, losing only two games en route to the championship, defeating Kevin Martin of Alberta in the final. At the subsequent World Championship, Stoughton went on to lose just one game, winning the Championship against Warwick Smith of Scotland. Stoughton would return to the 1999 Labatt Brier with 2 new players, Jon Mead and Doug Armstrong replacing Tresoor and Gould. The team went 10-3 winning in the final against Guy Hemmings of Quebec. However, at the 1999 Worlds, Stoughton's team would not be as successful as they were in 1996. The team went 9-2, but one of their losses was in the final against Hammy McMillan of Scotland. Stoughton and his Manitoba four-some returned to the 2000 Labatt Brier. The team, who had an excellent round robin, would bow out in the first game of the playoffs, and finish with a 9-4 record. Stoughton reached the 2006 Tim Hortons Brier with Mead, Van Den Berghe, and Gould. However, the team finished in sixth place with a record of 6-5, missing the playoffs. He also played for Manitoba at the 2007 Brier, with a new lineup of Ryan Fry, Rob Fowler, and Gould. He fared better than the previous year, but fell in the semifinal to eventual world champion Glenn Howard of Ontario; Howard held a four-point lead after nine ends, and Stoughton was ready to concede the game; however, CBC, who was broadcasting the game, requested that the tenth end be played for airtime reasons; the two teams ended up throwing all the stones through the house in the tenth end. Following the 2007-08 season, Ryan Fry left Team Stoughton to join Brad Gushue's rink. Fry was replaced with Kevin Park for the 2008-09 season.[1] The move proved to be fairly successful, as Stoughton lead his new team to the final of the 2009 Tim Hortons Brier in which they lost to Kevin Martin. Stoughton's rink qualified for the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials. The team finished third, after losing to Glenn Howard's rink in the semi-final. In February 2010 Jeff Stoughton won his 8th Manitoba provincial championship, a record for that province.[2] At the 2010 Tim Hortons Brier, Stoughton finished out of the playoffs despite a 7-4 record. In April 2010 Rob Fowler and Kevin Park quit the team and both decided to skip their own teams for 2010-2011.[3] Jeff brought back his past long time third Jon Mead, while also acquiring Reid Carruthers to play at second. Steve Gould will remain at lead. The team will attempt to make a run at the 2013 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials, and the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. With a new team of Jon Mead and Reid Carruthers, Stoughton won the 2011 Safeway Championship in Manitoba to qualify for the 2011 Tim Hortons Brier. There in London, Ontario, the team finished second in the round robin and went on to defeat Glenn Howard in the final 8-6, capturing Stoughton's third Brier championship.[4] Stoughton and his team also did well at the world championships, finishing first in the round robin and defeating Scotland's Tom Brewster a total of three times to win his second world title. Stoughton failed to reach the 2012 Tim Hortons Brier after losing to eventual provincial champion Rob Fowler in the quarterfinals of the 2012 Safeway Championship. A few weeks later, Stoughton dropped lead Steve Gould from his team.[5] It was then announced in May of 2012 that Mark Nichols would join the team for the next season as lead.[6] Stoughton is a system specialist for Air Canada. He is married to Halli Weiss, and they have a daughter, Elizabeth (born 2004). Stoughton is particularly known for his 360 "spin-o-rama" delivery, where he comes out of the hack, spins around and then throws the rock. Stoughton does this to entertain fans, but does not usually do it during games, except for meaningless shots. He also performed the move in a cameo appearance in the 2002 film Men With Brooms.
