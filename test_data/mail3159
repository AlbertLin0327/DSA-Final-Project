Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar (Hindi:    ; English: He who wins is the conqueror) is a 1992 Bollywood sports drama film directed by Mansoor Khan (who earlier directed Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak). The film stars Aamir Khan, Ayesha Jhulka, Mamik Singh, Deepak Tijori & Kulbhushan Kharbanda in the lead roles, whilst the brother of Aamir, Faisal Khan makes a special appearance. The music was by Jatin Lalit. It was remade in 2003 Bengali film Champion starring Bengali Superstar Jeet and inspired for 1999 Telugu film Thammudu and 2001 Tamil film Badri. Based on the 1979 American film Breaking Away, the film did above average business. The movie is set in Dehradun, a valley in North India. The movie opens with the description of the various colleges in the city. The Rajput college has students from affluent backgrounds with each student being an heir to a multimillion fortune. In contrast, the Model college has students from poor local households. Other colleges include Xaviers college and Queens college, the latter being an all girls college with the guys from all three colleges trying to woo them. The highlight of the town is the annual inter-college sports championship with a marathon cycle race as the prime event. In the beginning of the film, the race is contested between Ratan Lal Sharma of Model college and Shekhar Malhotra of Rajput college with the latter winning the race because Ratan had an inferior bike. After the race both are felicitated by their respective schools. Shekhar being rich and now the local champion is cocky and arrogant. Sanjay Lal Sharma a.k.a. Sanju is Ratan's younger brother and is everything that Ratan is not. He's a carefree youngster who is full of himself and is always in trouble with his father Ramlal, who wants him to act more maturely and become responsible like Ratan. Sanju and his little gang, which includes Anjali (who has a crush on Sanju), bunk sports to smoke cigarettes and roam around town. Anjali and her dad run a vehicle repair shop and Anjali's father asks his daughter to stay away from Sanju. Ramlal and his family run a small cafe which is the hangout spot for most of the college students. A number of scuffles occur between Sanju and Shekhar because of Shekhar's attempts to humiliate Ratan and his dad. Enter Devika (Pooja Bedi), who immediately catches the fancy of both Sanju and Shekhar. Initially she leans towards Shekhar but one day she misses her bus on the way to a picnic to meet Shekhar. Meanwhile Sanju asks Anjali for a car so that he can roam around town. While on his way he spots Devika and leaves his friends at the paan shop and gives Devika a lift. Devika upon reaching her destination finds Shekhar with another girl and goes along with Sanju who, although not rich, brags about his wealth. Sanju's lie is ultimately revealed when Devika sees him dancing in the Model college group during a dance competition. After the show, Sanju and Devika break up. In between, Sanju had quietly wasted money given to him by his father (he had saved it for Ratan's new cycle). This leads to a heated argument between Sanju and his dad. Next morning, Ramlal leaves for town and Ratan is out cycling. He stops to meet his girlfriend when Shekhar and his friends pass by. A heated argument and fight ensue, which end in tragedy when Ratan accidentally falls off a cliff. While Ratan is in hospital the song, Sanju recollects his childhood with Ratan. When his father returns, he reconciles with him. With Ratan in the hospital, Sanju becomes more responsible and decides that he will participate in the race and give it his best for Ratan. During his training, he realises his true feelings for Anjali and the two embrace each other. A day before the race, Sanju finds out about the real cause of the accident and confronts Ratan who tells him that he didn't say anything because Sanju had become responsible and closer to all of them. Ratan asks Sanju to give his best in the race if he wants to do something for him. With his new cycle, Sanju participates in the race. The race begins evenly with both Sanju and Shekhar going head to head. Somewhere in the middle, the two fall and a scuffle ensues between Sanju and Shekhar. During this, other cyclists take the lead. Shekhar heads back on track with his friends holding Sanju back. Sanju breaks free and joins the race, catching up with Shekhar and finally beating him in the closing moments. The music for the movie composed by Jatin Lalit and lyrics were penned by Majrooh Sultanpuri. The soundtrack, their second collaboration, helped to launch their career. "Pehla Nasha" was the second film song in Indian cinema (the first one being 'Sundari Neeyum' from Michael Madana Kama Rajan starring Kamal Haasan) to be shot in complete slow motion and the trend caught up subsequently with many films and music videos. One of the freshest movies to come out of Bollywood, this has been shot predominantly in various locations [2] in the south of India. This is a prime example of how Bollywood is as usual shy of using original names of the locations. So it's Dehradun instead of the pristine Kodaikanal.[3]
