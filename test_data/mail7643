The ditions Alphonse Leduc company is a prominent French music publishing house specializing in classical music. It was created in Paris in 1841. ditions Alphonse Leduc is a family business that has been passed down from father to son over five generations. The family is originally from Arnay-le-Duc, in the Burgundy region of France. The family musical origins began in Arnay-le-Duc in Burgundy and its first musician, Antoine Girard. Girard was a violinist who left his father's weaving shop to turn his attention to art. His son Charles Girard, who was born in Arnay-le-Duc in 1754, moved to Nantes and was the first full-time musician. The Girards were a large family and its Nantes branch added Leduc to its name, taken from its place of origin Arnay-le-Duc. From then on all of the Girards of this branch were known as Girard-Leduc, and often, for the sake of simplification in business, just Leduc. Alphonse Leduc, teacher, composer, student and flute, guitar and bassoon virtuoso of Anton Reicha in Paris, was born in Nantes in 1804 and died in Paris in 1868. He transferred his publishing house from Nantes to Paris in 1841. His son, Alphonse-Charles Leduc (Paris 1844-1892), created the important instrumental teaching collections which became the company's speciality and have been constantly expanded ever since. Alphonse-Charles's son, Alphonse mile Leduc (18781951), continued the teaching collections, developed the company's school edtitions and published several important symphonic composers. His sons, Claude-Alphonse (19101995) and Gilbert Leduc (19111985), who entered the business in 1928, managed and further expanded ditions A. Leduc from 1951 to 1985. ditions Alphonse Leduc have absorbed a number of publishing companies during their existence, in recent years B.G., Bornemann, C.Y., Gras, Hamelle, Heugel, Hortensia, King, Notissimo and Ouvrires .

Through Diffusion BIM, Alphonse Leduc also distributes internationally the brass music of all publishers worldwide. Alphonse Leduc and its subsidiary company Heugel have taken control of the well-known American music publishing and distribution company King Music, thus becoming a group of international scope. The history of the publishing house Heugel dates back to 1839 when Jacques Lopold Heugel became the associate of the music publisher Jean-Antoine Meissonnier. They acquired a periodical, Le Mnestrel, which had been founded in 1833 and was issued until 1940. Their association ended in 1842 when Heugel took over sole control. Lopold Heugel was succeeded on his death in 1883 by his son Henri, since when the company remained in the family until it was bought by Leduc in 1980. The Heugel catalogue includes all musical genres, both French and international, in particular opera and operetta (Jules Massenet, Ambroise Thomas, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, douard Lalo, Lo Delibes, Jacques Offenbach, etc.). Since 1920 Heugel has published much modern music, including that of Reynaldo Hahn, Joseph Canteloube, Francis Poulenc, Darius Milhaud, Andr Jolivet, and, closer to us, Pierre Boulez, Henri Dutilleux, Betsy Jolas, Gilbert Amy. Le Pupitre, a collection of early music was started in 1967, whose critical editions are highly respected by musicologists all over the world. Hamelle was founded in 1877 by Julien Hamelle who had taken over the catalogue of Maho, a company founded in 1851. Julien Hamelle directed the firm until his death in 1917, when he was succeeded by his son Georges-Edgard. The catalogue, acquired and now distributed by ditions Leduc, includes an important collection of piano music. Hamelle also published works of douard Lalo, Vincent d'Indy, Gabriel Piern, Camille Saint-Sans, Charles-Marie Widor, and in particular, those of Gabriel Faur (Requiem, lgie, Pavane, as well as the famous Mlodies etc.) The fifth generation is represented by Franois Leduc (Claude's son) and Basile Crichton (the nephew of Claude and Gilbert Leduc), who have been the managers of the company since 1985, assisted by their respective brothers, Jean Leduc et Michel Crichton.[1] The Alphonse Leduc catalogue includes many musical composers past and present in particular the noted French flautist and pedagogue Louis Moyse.
