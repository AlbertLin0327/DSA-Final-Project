Lady Elizabeth Dewhurst (Suzanne von Borsody) believes her husband Gregor (Iain Glen) is at fault for the accidental death of her beloved brother Simon (William Mickleburgh). Their marriage has been rocky, but this is the last straw and she asks him to move out of the household. Elizabeth's best friend Mary Phillips {Rachel Fielding} has had her eye on Gregor for some time and sees this as her chance. She encourages them to use the services of a powerful but shady family attorney, Mr. Sharp (Jonathan Coy), and Sharp expects to benefit financially from the division of the Dewherst estate. Peter Rosen (Rutger Hauer) is visiting from a local University. Liz is drawn to him for a mild affair, even though he is the professor of her son Alex (Daniel Sharman).
