Digital telephony is the use of digital electronics in the provision of digital telephone services and systems. Since the 1960s a digital core network has almost entirely replaced the old analog system, and much of the access network has also been digitized. Digital telephony was introduced to provide voice services at lower cost, but was then found to be of great value to new network services such as ISDN that could use digital facilities to transfer data speedily over telephone lines.
