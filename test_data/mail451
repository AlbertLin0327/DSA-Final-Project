Geldeston was a station in Geldeston, Norfolk - a station on the Waveney Valley Line. It was opened in the early 1860s, and closed to passengers nearly a century later in 1953. It was the penultimate station on the line, and the last in Norfolk as the line crossed the border into Suffolk before terminating at Beccles. The station still exists today and can easily be found in Geldeston. Coordinates: 522813N 13041E / 52.47015N 1.51152E / 52.47015; 1.51152
