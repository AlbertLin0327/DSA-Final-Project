Conrad Weidenhammer (January 27, 1866  January 19, 1919) was a farmer and provincial level politician from Alberta, Canada. He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1913 to 1917 sitting with the Conservative caucus. Weidenhammer's wife gave birth to a daughter at Elmira, Ontario on March 24, 1896.[2] Weidenhammer ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature in the 1905 Alberta general election. He ran as the Conservative candidate in the electoral district of Stony Plain but finished a distant third place, losing to Liberal candidate John McPherson.[3] McPherson and Weidenhammer would run against each other once again in the 1913 Alberta general election. This time Weidenhammer would defeat McPherson in a straight contest winning over 60% of the popular vote.[4] It is said he had the broad support of the local German community during the election.[5] Weidenhammer would serve out his term in office before retiring from Alberta provincial politics in 1917.
