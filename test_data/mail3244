John Scotus (approx. 990 AD - 10 November 1066) was a Bishop of Mecklenburg, from Scotia. It is possible, even likely, that this John can be identified as the John who was allegedly made Bishop of Glasgow sometime between 1055 and 1060, and possibly the John allegedly holding the title of Bishop of Orkney. He was killed in 1066 during a Wendish rebellion against Christianity, when he was sacrificed to Radegast.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
