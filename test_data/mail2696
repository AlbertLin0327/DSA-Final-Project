Saskatchewan Air Ambulance (also called LIFEGARD) is the air ambulance service for the province of Saskatchewan and for the Ministry of Health (Saskatchewan). The air ambulance program was established in 1946 as the first non-military air medical transport program in the world; since October 2008, the Ministry of Health administers the program with operations handled by the Saskatoon Health Region. [1] The program makes use of three King Air B200 aircraft based out of the Saskatoon John G. Diefenbaker International Airport with an aircraft also stationed at the Regina International Airport. The service also makes use of contracted service from provides such as Transwest Air. [2] The Saskatchewan Air Ambulance Service also coordinates with Shock Trauma Air Rescue Society, that is being contracted to station helicopters at both the Saskatoon and Regina airports. [3] Lifeguard 3 is currently undergoing maintenance and repair after sliding off the runway at Maple Creek. At 12 noon January 3rd, 2011 lifeguard 3 touched down. At 120 knots the plane began to veer to the right. The pilot tried to correct the turn but the plane still continued to slide. After coming completely coming off the runway the plane flipped and spun three times. The patient was taken to hospital and made a full recovery. The pilot, nurse and paramedic all made it out with no injuries.
