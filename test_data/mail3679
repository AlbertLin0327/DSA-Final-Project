They exist in all 8 Route 66 states: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.[1] The California Historic Route 66 Association is the youngest of the 8, being established in December 1990 and dedicated to the U.S. Route 66 in California. It publishes a quarterly newsletter Roadsigns, whict includes various news and history related to Route 66 in California, among other things.

The Arizona association was instrumental in making the Seligman-Kingman stretch of Route 66 to be officially recognized as "Historic Route 66", a designation later extended to the whole Route 66 in Arizona.[2] The New Mexico Route 66 Association dedicated to the U.S. Route 66 in New Mexico.[3] The Texas Old Route 66 Association, dedicated to the U.S. Route 66 in Texas, was incorporated in 1991.

The association publishes the quarterly newsletter, Show Me Route 66, which describes various projects associated with Route 66.[7] The Route 66 Association of Illinois is dedicated to the U.S. Route 66 in Illinois. Initiated in March 1989, it was incorporated in October 1989 in Dwight, Illinois.[8] Founded 1995, the National Historic Route 66 Federation publishes the "Route 66 Dining & Lodging Guide" (since 1999, currently including over 500 mostly vintage businesses) and a 200-page "EZ66 GUIDE For Travelers" (since 2005). With a stated objective of bringing Route 66 historians, authors, artists, photographers, business people and enthusiasts with citizens within U.S. Route 66 host communities, the federation presents an annual John Steinbeck Award to an individual who had contributed significantly to the preservation of Route 66 and organises an Adopt-A-Hundred programme in which adopters watch 100-mile segments for possible preservation problems along the route such as bridges, businesses or stretches of roadbed being closed. These same adopters were to review the dining and lodging businesses while they travelled. The National Historic Route 66 Federation is working with the National Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program to issue $10 million in matching fund grants under the National Route 66 Preservation Bill (1999) to individuals, corporations and communities preserving or restoring historic properties along the historic route.[9]
