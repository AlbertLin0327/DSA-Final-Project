Little Harbour is a drive-through community of 13 families on the southern Twillingate island, approximately 3km south of Twillingate on Route 340. Little Harbour is known for its scenic atmosphere and authentic small town feel. Little Harbour has several wharfs, which were used by fishermen years ago, as well as a historic church that is no longer being used and a trail that leads to Lower Little Harbour, which can be walked, biked or drove on using a 4x4 vehicle. One of the main attractions in Lower Little Harbour is the Natural Arch. There's a large rosette window on the rear facade. The stage/wharf of Little Harbour is known as "Pardy's Stage" more formerly known as "William Pardy Stage". It is the oldest building in the community of Little Harbour.
