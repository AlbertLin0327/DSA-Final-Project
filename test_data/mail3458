The Dexiarchia are a clade of sea slugs, shell-less marine gastropod molluscs in the clade Nudipleura.[1] This classification is based on the study by Schrdl et al., published in 2001, who recognized within this clade two clades Pseudoeuctenidiacea and Cladobranchia.[2] Contains the subclades Euarminida, Dendronotida and Aeolidida
