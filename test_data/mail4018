Pakistan Sangeet Icon is a reality-based singing competition shown on MTV Pakistan, Indus TV and Gkaboom. It is based on the popular British show Pop Idol and its American counterpart American Idol. The show aims to find the most talented young singer in Pakistan. The show begins with a cross-country tour in which aspiring singers audition in front of three judges, namely Ali Haider, Mekaal Hasan and Pappu (all recording artists). Eventually the number of performers is narrowed down with each competitor performing live. Viewers have two hours following the broadcast of the show to phone or text in their votes for their favourite competitor. On the following week, the competitor with the fewest votes is eliminated. The two remaining finalists battle it out during the Finale and viewers have more time allotted to vote. The next day, the competitor with the most votes is declared the winner and is awarded One Crore Rupees.[2][3] The winner of the first competition was Asad Abbas. Asad later joined Mekaal Hasan Band in mid 2010. Shahid Mehmood has the biggest collection of Asad Abbas performances on its Youtube channel. You can also watch Pakistan Sangeet Icon Season One on the same Youtube channel. The winner of the second season of Pakistan Sangeet icon was Ather Sani.
