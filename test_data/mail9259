The Theme (Russian: ) is a 1979 Soviet film directed by Gleb Panfilov. It tells the story of an egotistical playwright who thinks of himself as an artist, but who allows the system to make him write conformist plays. The film was heavily censored on its release in 1979. The full version was not released until 1986; this version was awarded the Golden Bear at the 37th Berlin International Film Festival.[1] Films by year: 19171921 1922 1923 1924 1925 1926 1927 1928 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 1938 1939 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 19801991 Heartland (1980) Palermo or Wolfsburg (1980) Deprisa, Deprisa (1981) Veronika Voss (1982) Ascendancy (1983) La colmena (1983) Love Streams (1984) Die Frau und der Fremde (1985) Wetherby (1985) Stammheim (1986) The Theme (1987) Red Sorghum (1988) Rain Man (1989) Music Box (1990) Larks on a String (1990) La casa del sorriso (1991) Grand Canyon (1992) Woman Sesame Oil Maker (1993) The Wedding Banquet (1993) In the Name of the Father (1994) L'Appt (1995) Sense and Sensibility (1996) The People vs. Larry Flynt (1997) Central Station (1998) The Thin Red Line (1999) Complete List (19511959) (19601979) (19801999) (2000present)
