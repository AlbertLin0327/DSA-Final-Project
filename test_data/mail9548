Lianhe Wanbao (Chinese: ; pinyin: Linh Wn bo; literally United Evening Paper) is a Singapore Chinese afternoon newspaper published daily by Singapore Press Holdings (SPH). It was started on March 16, 1983 after the merger between as Nanyang Siang Pau and Sin Chew Jit Poh. Although it is named Lianhe Wanbao and is also owned by SPH, the paper bears little resemblance with its more serious broadsheet counterpart Lianhe Zaobao and is not to be mistaken as the aforementioned evening edition. Lianhe Wanbao focuses mainly on local and entertainment news with minimal international coverage. As such it is in competition with another SPH paper Shin Min Daily News. Amongst Singapore readers Lianhe Wanbao is often regarded more of a tabloid published in broadsheet form, and the veracity of some reports (mostly reproduced from tabloids or gossip magazines from Hong Kong or Taiwan) is sometimes questioned. Since 1 January 2005, Lianhe Wanbao has undergone a restructuring and reformatting. The paper now adopts more serious reporting than Shin Min Daily and tries to attract younger readers through the use of colorful, uncluttered formatting.
