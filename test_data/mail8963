The 24th Ryder Cup Matches were held at the Walton Heath Golf Club in Walton-on-the-Hill, Surrey, England. The United States team won the competition by a score of 18 to 9 points. To date it remains the heaviest defeat that a European team has suffered at the hands of the United States. The Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. The competition format was adjusted slightly from the 1979 event, with the order of play swapped on the first two days and the third day singles matches held in a single session: With a total of 28 points, 14 points were required to win the Cup. All matches were played to a maximum of 18 holes. Captain: England John Jacobs Captain: Dave Marr
