Miho: Journey to the Mountain is an album by Paul Winter Consort, released in 2010 through the record label Living Music.[1] The album was commissioned by the Miho Museum in Kyoto, Japan to be a musical celebration of the museum. The museum is a unique piece of architecture, built on the top of a mountain, and partially tunneling into it, giving the experience of the museum being part of the Earth. The album was recorded in the corridors of the museum, which are naturally reverberant. In 2011, the album earned the group a Grammy Award for Best New Age Album.
