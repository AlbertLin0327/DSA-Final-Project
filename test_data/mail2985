Bookclub is a monthly programme, devised by Olivia Seligman and hosted by Jim Naughtie and broadcast on BBC Radio 4. Each month a novel is selected, and its author invited to discuss it. The title of the chosen work for the next recording is announced at the end of each broadcast; this allows for listeners to read the book, and those who attend recording to put questions to the author. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
