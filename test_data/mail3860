Lion, London Zoological Gardens (French: Lions, Jardin zoologique, Londres) is a 1896 French short black-and-white silent actuality film, produced by Auguste and Louis Lumire and directed by Alexandre Promio, featuring a male lion reaching through the bars of its enclosure at London Zoological Gardens to get at the meat thrown by its keeper. The film was part of a series, including Tigers and Pelicans, which were one of the earliest examples of animal life on film.[1] Given its age, this short film is available to freely download from the Internet.
