Andrew David Brownrigg (born 2 August 1976) is an English former professional footballer. Brownrigg began his career as a trainee with Hereford United, making his dbut during the 199495 season. In March 1995, after just eight league games for the Bulls, he was transferred to Norwich City for a fee of 100,000. He spent part of the following season on loan to Kettering Town and in August 1997 moved to Rotherham United having failed to make a first team appearance for Norwich, despite being an unused sub in the Premier League game against Arsenal at Highbury on 1 April 1995. After being on the bench against Cambridge Utd during Rotherham United's opening game of the 200708 season, Andy was attacked by a youth with a hammer and suffered serious facial injuries. This led to Andy being out of the professional game for over three months, which in turn, significantly hindered his chances of appearing for Rotherham's first team during that season. Subsequently he joined Stalybridge Celtic on loan in March 1998, and was released by Rotherham at the end of the season. He joined Yeovil Town, but left for personal reasons and by November 1998 was again playing for Stalybridge Celtic. It was reported that Andy would be signing for Tamworth that December, but this did not transpire so he moved to Stocksbridge Park Steels. He signed for Kidderminster Harriers in July 1999[2] and helped them to the Football Conference title, and with it promotion to the Football League the following season. On 21 July 2000 Brownrigg was transferred to Scottish side Greenock Morton, costing 26,500.[3] It later transpired that Morton were in turmoil off the field, with claims that they had failed to pay Kidderminster their fee[3] and in October 2000 Brownrigg was staying away from the club claiming that the club owed him money.[4][5] The result was that Brownrigg played just three first team games before leaving in March 2001, joining Hartlepool United,[6] although he was released in May 2001 having failed to break into the Hartlepool side. He was linked with a return to Kidderminster,[7] but in June 2001 joined Northwich Victoria. He subsequently moved to Hednesford Town later that year and moved to Gainsborough Trinity in June 2002.[8] He was released in September 2002 and joined Wakefield & Emley. He had a trial with Worksop Town in the 2003 close season and also had a trial with Oxford United in November the same year. He joined Maltby Main, but left to join Ossett Albion. He then rejoined Maltby Main in January 2004 and signed for Conference side Scarborough in March 2004, but decided to leave the club the following month[9] and rejoined Maltby Main for the final promotion push at the end of the season.[10] He subsequently joined Hallam, leaving to join Buxton in March 2005.[10] Was a virtual ever-present the following season when the Bucks won the NCEL Premier League title and was very popular with the supporters at the Silverlands who adapted the 'Arthur Brownlow' song of Stockport County in his honour.[11] He left Buxton in July 2006 due to travelling difficulties and the fact that he was about to embark on a Sport and Exercise Psychology degree at Huddersfield University.[12][13] He joined Sheffield FC during the 2006 close season. During that forthcoming season Andy played a significant role in Sheffield's promotion from the NCEL Premier League, which personally made it back to back promotions from the NCEL Premier League in successive seasons. At the end this season Andy left Sheffield, and after a brief period without a club he rejoined Hallam in November 2007. In December 2008 he moved from Hallam to Staveley MW.[14] In September 2009, Andy left Staveley Miners Welfare, and rejoined Hallam FC. In March 2010, Andy re-signed for Ossett Albion in the Northern Premier League for the purpose of fitness for a proposed move to Worksop Town FC. Andy signed for Worksop Town in the NPL Premier Division, after playing three games for Ossett. At the beginning of the 2010/11 season Brownrigg signed for AFC Emley in the Northern Counties East League Division 1. On 16 June 2008 Brownrigg was admitted to Sporting Chance, a recovery clinic[15] set up by former England International Tony Adams MBE for sportsmen and women. During his time in the clinic Andy was treated for addictive-related problems. Subsequently, on 11 June 2008, and thanks to a successful period of rehabilitation, Brownrigg returned home to Sheffield where he remains to this day in grateful and consistent recovery. On 16 July 2009 at The University of Huddersfield, Andy graduated with a First Class Honours Degree in Sport and Exercise Psychology. In recognition of this and his research area, the University of Huddersfield offered Andy a PhD Scholarship which began in October 2009. Andys doctorate will look to explore the transitional experiences of professional footballers. Interest in this topic of research stems from his own experiences of professional football. The study will look to increase understanding in this area of psychology with a direct aim of informing those interested in the welfare of professional players.
