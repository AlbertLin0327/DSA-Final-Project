The Shin-Takasegawa Pumped Storage Station uses the Takase River to operate a pumped storage hydroelectric scheme about 12km (7mi) west of machi in Nagano Prefecture, Japan. Construction on the complex began in 1971, concluded in 1978 and the power station was commissioned in 1979. The power plant has a 1,280 MW installed capacity and its upper reservoir is created by the Takase Dam, a rock-fill dam  which at 176m (577ft) in height is the tallest of its type in Japan.[1] It is also the second tallest dam in Japan, next to Kurobe Dam.[2] Creating the upper reservoir is the Takase Dam which is a 176m (577ft) tall and 362m (1,188ft) long rock-fill embankment dam with a structural volume of 11,586,000 m3 (15,153,916 cuyd). The Takase Reservoir has a 76,200,000 m3 (61,776 acreft) capacity of which only 16,200,000 m3 (13,134acreft) is active (or "useful") for power generation. The low active capacity of the reservoir is due to the high levels of silt in the Takase River which cause the reservoir to reserve 79 percent of its capacity for this purpose. During operation, the upper reservoir only draws down 10m (33ft).[1] During periods of high energy demand, water from the Takase Reservoir is released down to the power station. After received by the intake, water initially travels along two 8m (26ft) diameter and 2,600m (8,530ft) long head-race tunnels. At the terminus of these tunnels, they split into four 330m (1,083ft) long penstocks which drop down a 200m (656ft) deep shaft to the underground power station. At the power station, the water operates four 320 MW reversible Francis turbine-generators before being discharged into the lower reservoir, created by the Nanakura Dam. When energy demand is low and therefore electricity less expensive, the turbines reverse and pump water from the lower reservoir back into the upper reservoir. This process repeats depending upon energy demand and water availability. Water released from the lower reservoir is used to power the Nakanosawa Power Station which uses 140.8m (462ft) of hydraulic head to power a single 42 MW Francis turbine generator.[1] It was commissioned in May 1980.[3] The Nanakura Dam is a 125m (410ft) tall and 340m (1,115ft) long rock-fill embankment dam with a structural volume of 7,380,000 m3 (9,652,676 cuyd). The reservoir created by the dam, the lower reservoir, has a 32,500,000 m3 (26,348 acreft) capacity of which 16,200,000 m3 (13,134acreft) is active. To protect in against rapid draw-down in water levels (as much as 28m (92ft)), the top of the dam is coated in hard rock materials.[1]
