Zvi Mowshowitz is a former professional Magic: The Gathering player who also held a developer intern position at Wizards of the Coast Magic R&D. He is known for having created innovative and sometimes game-breaking decks like TurboZvi and My Fires, as well as many other notable decks that put up respectable finishes at highly competitive Magic: The Gathering tournaments. His first place finishes include a Pro Tour and a Grand Prix. He has placed in the top eight of four Pro Tours, and earned over $140,000 playing Magic competitively.[5] In 2007, Mowshowitz was elected into the Magic Hall of Fame [6] Mowshowitz was particularly noted for exploiting previously undiscovered card interactions and demonstrating that cards once believed to be quite poor were in fact "broken", meaning sufficiently powerful as to be game-dominating, when fully understood. Examples include Yawgmoth's Bargain once believed to be unplayable but which was rapidly banned as "too powerful" after Zvi demonstrated its potential when fully exploited, and Dream Halls, the engine behind the now-legendary TurboZvi deck archetype. He is also an avid internet writer, previously with "The Dojo", "Mindripper", New Wave Brainburst, StarCityGames.com, and then for the official Magic website MagicTheGathering.com.[5] In April 2006, Zvi stopped writing for MagicTheGathering.com.
