Palauan cuisine includes local foods such as cassava, taro, yam, potato, fish, and pork. Western cuisine is favored among young Palauans. Palau has a very small population with a lot of foreign tourists. Restaurants on the main island of Koror consist mainly of Korean food, as well as Chinese, burgers, pizza, pasta, etc. Indigenous cuisine consists mainly of root vegetables, fish, pigs, and chicken, but you won't find a restaurant offering such fare. Also Palau offers the most odd cuisine ever imagine, the fruit bat. The same can be claimed of the rest of Micronesia with the exception that the rest of Micronesia does not see a lot of tourism and so has a lot fewer restaurants. Tourists eat mainly at their hotels on these less visited islands. Some local foods include an alcoholic drink made from coconut on the tree, the drink made from the roots of the Kava Plant, and the chewing of betel nuts. There is also a Filipino presence in the islands, so their cuisine is also present.
