The University of Teramo (Italian: Universit degli Studi di Teramo, UNITE) is a university located in Teramo, Italy. The academic institution was established in 1993, detached from the University of Chieti in a moment of strong tension between supporters of autonomy and those wanting to maintain the traditional structure. The University of Teramo now offers 5 faculties, 24 degree courses, 35 Masters, 6 postgraduate schools and 10 departments. The entire 50,000 sq m of the Coste Sant'Agostino Campus holds the faculties of Law, Communication Sciences, and Political Science. A scientific pole is currently underway and will house the faculties of Veterinary Medicine and Agriculture. It consists of a very up-to-date facility of 100,000 sq m which will also accommodate a Veterinary Hospital and a Sanitary Dog Kennel. The Campus and Pole are two realities symbolizing the core areas of the University: the legal, political and communicative areas together with the agro-bio-veterinary area which represent two centers of excellence of the University of Teramo. Communication technologies have always influenced both thought and learning methods. As a result, facilities more and more necessary to the knowledge society such as language, multimedia, television laboratories, the university newspaper, and radio station, have been carried out. The University is living a strong period of internationalization through offering scholarships to students from all over of the world.
