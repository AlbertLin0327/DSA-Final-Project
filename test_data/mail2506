The 2013 United States federal budget request for government operations for the 2013 fiscal year (October 2012September 2013) was submitted by President Barack Obama on February 13, 2012, according to the budget process.[1] Under current law, the Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates caps on discretionary spending. In addition, several temporary tax cuts are scheduled to expire at the beginning of the 2013 calendar year, including the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts on income, payroll, capital gains, and the estate tax, due to the expiration of the 2010 Obama-GOP tax deal and the 2012 payroll tax cut extension. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was passed in August 2011 as a resolution to the debt-ceiling crisis. The fiscal year (FY) 2013 budget is the first to be affected by the second of two rounds of budget cuts specified in the act. (The first round of cuts has already been applied to the ten years beginning in FY2012.) For this second round of cuts, the Budget Control Act had formed the United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, sometimes referred to as the "supercommittee", to identify at least $1.2 trillion in cuts over the ten years beginning with FY2013, and specified automatic across-the-board cuts if no such budget reduction legislation was passed by Congress.[2] On November 21, 2011, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction announced that it did not reach a deal on the budget-cutting legislation, raising the possibility that the automatic cuts would be activated if the full Congress could not enact its own deficit reduction legislation by December 23, 2011. The supercommittee's lack of an agreement was attributed to the refusal of Republicans to consider any tax increases, combined with Democratic insistence on including these revenue increases such as the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, which under current law expire at the end of 2012.[3] The automatic cuts of $1.2 trillion over ten years would be split equally between security and non-security programs, and include $500 billion in cuts to the Department of Defense. The FY2013 defense budget would be reduced 11%, from $525 billion to $472 billion, after already having been cut from $571 billion in the first installment of cuts in the Budget Control Act. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta initially gave the total cut figure as 23%.[4] The planned cuts include reductions in troop levels, a modest limit in pay raises for soldiers starting in 2015, an increase in health fees for veterans, delays in the construction of new naval ships and in the purchasing of new fighter aircraft such as the F-35, and the possibility of a round of base closings within the United States, but cuts to special operations, cyberwarfare, and intelligence programs were avoided.[5] Initial reports had also suggested that the number of carrier battle groups might be reduced from 11 to 10,[4] although it was later determined that the number of aircraft carriers would not in fact be cut.[6] Some Republicans in Congress advocated reversing the cuts to the military, citing the effect on national security, and Secretary Panetta has opposed the cuts, calling them "devastating" and raising "substantial risk of not being able to meet our defense needs." President Obama has promised to veto any legislation seeking to avoid the cuts, and House Speaker John Boehner also indicated his commitment to following the cuts in the Budget Control Act.[3][7] The Budget Control Act also specifies automatic cuts of 7.8% to domestic programs and 2% to Medicare, while Medicaid and Social Security will be unaffected. These entitlement programs were protected from cuts in return for the absence of new revenues in the Budget Control Act.[8] The automatic cuts to domestic programs would include cuts of up to 11% to science research and development agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, NASA, and the U. S. National Laboratories run by the Department of Energy. It is anticipated that this could cause federal grant acceptance levels to fall into the single digits, a consequence which has been called catastrophic for academic institutions by Michael Lubell of the American Physical Society. The cuts could also endanger politically controversial research such as climate change research programs in NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.[9] Due to the role of scientific research in economic growth and job creation, and given international competition in this field, the cuts have been opposed by professional and academic organizations, and federal support of research and development has been called "an area of U.S. investment too critical to be cut" by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.[10][11] The Obama administration's 2013 budget proposal, which was released on February 13, 2012, was defeated by a unanimous 990 vote of the United States Senate on May 16, 2012, the second year in a row that the president's proposed budget was defeated by a unanimous vote in the Senate. The House of Representatives rejection in March by a vote of 4140 means the Obama administration's budget failed to win a single vote.[12] The Obama administration's 2013 budget proposal was nearly two thousand pages in length and was released on February 13, 2012. House Republicans submitted their own 52 page bill that they called 'The Obama Budget', which was defeated by a unanimous 990 vote of the Senate on May 16, 2012. I think its readily apparent there is a big difference between the presidents budget, which I hold in my hands, and what Sen. Sessions has presented as being the presidents budget. This is not the presidents budget. So, of course, were not going to support it. Its not what the president proposed.[13] The Obama administration's February 2012 budget request contained $2.902 trillion in receipts and $3.803 trillion in outlays, for a deficit of $901 billion.[14] The budget projects a reduction in the deficit to $575 billion by 2018 before rising to $704 billion by 2022.[15] Total receipts (in billions of dollars):: Total outlays by agency (in billions of dollars):
