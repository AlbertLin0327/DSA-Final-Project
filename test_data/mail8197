Traffic Information Service-Broadcast (TIS-B) is an aviation information service broadcast provided to aircraft using both the 1090 MHz extended squitter (1090 ES) and the Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) band of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)[1]. Currently the service mainly benefits General Aviation (GA) aircraft who have equipped with ADS-B In hardware by providing a traffic information relay to a screen in the cockpit. This allows pilots to see real time satellite and radar data similar to what an air traffic controller sees on the ground. At this time TIS-B is meant to be only a supplement to visual separation when operating in visual meteorological conditions (VMC) and as a backup to radar when operating under Instrument flight rules (IFR)
