L'Alpina is an Italian fashion company known[by whom?] for its "Australian" brand. The logo used on its garments is that of a left-facing kangaroo. It was popular in the 1980s among the United Kingdom's football casuals. It can sometimes be mistaken for the lower end brand Kangol which also uses a similar image for its clothing. It is still available in mainland Europe with a flagship store in Amsterdam, and it is about to be re-introduced into the United Kingdom by Microzine, an online retail company based in 2008's European Capital of Culture, Liverpool. The brand has previously been attempted to be re-introduced into the UK market by a company based in Chester, Tessuti, albeit unsuccessfully. A range of Australian tennis clothing can be found in London at a company called Wigmore Sports.
