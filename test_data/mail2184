Baradene College of the Sacred Heart is a Catholic high school for girls aged between 11 to 18 (Year 7-13) located in Remuera, Auckland, New Zealand. It is based on the philosophy of Madeleine Sophie Barat, who founded the Society of the Sacred Heart. Established 1909, Baradene celebrated its 100th year in 2009. The students participate in school events like House Parades, swimming sports, athletics day, house singing, and gain points for their houses. They also have, at the end of each year, a school mass farewelling the seniors of the school, opening mass (celebrating the new school year) and individual year level liturgies (farewelling the leavers of each level at the end of the year) Every year a different school goal is chosen as the focus of the year from the list of 5: Three school buildings, Mitchelson House, the original building, and the former stables, are listed as Category II Historic Places.[2][3][4] The school is currently constructing a new building which is planned to be finished later in 2009.[dated info] Baradene College has six houses: Students attend a House Mass in the school chapel once a year.
