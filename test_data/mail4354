Zhodzina (Belarusian: , odzina, [odzina] - Russian: , odino, [odn]), or Zhodino, is a city in Belarus, located in the Minsk Region, 50km to north-east from Minsk. The city covers an area of 19km and has a population of 61,800 (2010).[1] It is one of the newest cities in the country; its construction began in 1963. The city, the most populated in the Smalyavichy Raion, is situated 50km (31mi) in north-east of Minsk and 15km (9mi) south-west of Barysaw. It is crossed by the Plisa river and has a little lake in its southern suburb. There are nine schools, two high schools, one professional lyceum and Zhodzina polytechnical college in the city. However there is no higher educational institution in Zhodzina. The BelAZ automobile factory (The Belarusian Automobile Plant) is the largest employer in the city, and with about 11,000 workers, about one-sixth of the local population work there. Every third mining truck in the world is produced by them - their biggest can carry 360 tonnes. Another important factory is the clothing manufacturer "SVITANAK", which produces children's and adults' clothes. Its products are exported to European countries. Zhodzina is served by the M1 motorway, part of the European route E30, an international highway[2] that links Berlin and Warsaw to Moscow. It counts two railway stations (Zhodzina and the stop of Zhodzina Yuzhny[3][4]) on the international line Minsk-Moscow; and its main station is served by some international trains as the Sibirjak Berlin-Novosibirsk. Minsk International Airport is in 40km (25mi) from Zhodzina. The local football club is the Torpedo Zhodino, playing in the Belarusian Premier League. Its home ground is the Torpedo Stadium.
