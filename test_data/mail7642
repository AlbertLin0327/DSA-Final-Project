Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council extended the mandate of MINUSTAH, to be renewed for further periods.[2] It also welcomed a report by the Secretary-General Kofi Annan which stated that the peacekeeping operation had made progress towards an environment suitable for political transition, though challenges remained.
