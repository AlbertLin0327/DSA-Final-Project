Taekwondo Olympic gold medalist Lee Le Ting strikes terror into others with her arrogance and brutal fists. Little does she know she has captured the heart of a wealthy, handsome european bachelor, Louis, who has been infatuated with her since their first meeting (in the prequel Ingenuo). It's hate at first sight for Le Ting as she disgusts pretty boys! But Louis does all he can to bring himself closer to her... Although he was adopted by Yung Jo's parents, he treats Yung Jo as a real brother. His biological father is Cloud's father, who had a passionate love affair with his then 15 year old mother, Isabella, making Cloud his half brother. As he grew older, his mother came back for him and brought him to his biological father. His mother had become a fashion designer, and because there was no one to model the appearance in full clothing and makeup of the "Charlotte" doll, she had Louis do it temporarily. Accidentally, Cloud saw "Charlotte" who was really Louis in disguise.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
