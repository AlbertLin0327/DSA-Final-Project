30 Gallon Tank is an EP from Austin, Texas, indie rock band Spoon.[1] The 7" record was released on May 5, 1998, as a promotional EP showcasing the newly signed Elektra Records band.[2] Released on the same day was Spoon's second LP A Series of Sneaks. The a-side of 30 Gallon Tank contained two tracks that also appeared on Sneaks, while the b-side contained a new Spoon song and a previously released Drake Tungsten track.[2] All songs written and composed by Britt Daniel, except where noted.
