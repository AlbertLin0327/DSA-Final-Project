NYS Route 30 marker Numbered highways in New York Interstate U.S. N.Y. (former) Reference County New York State Route30 (NY30) is a state highway in the central part of New York in the United States. It extends for 300.71 miles (483.95km) from an interchange with NY17 in the Southern Tier to the Canadian border in the state's North Country, where it continues into Quebec as Route138. On a regional level, the route serves to connect the Catskill Park to the Adirondack Park. In the latter, NY30 is known as the Adirondack Trail. Aside from the state parks, the route serves the city of Amsterdam (where it meets the New York State Thruway) and several villages. NY30 was assigned in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to most of its modern routing south of Wells, replacing a series of designations that had been assigned to the highway in the 1920s. The portion of what is now NY30 north of Speculator was initially part of NY10. When that route was truncated to Arietta c.1960, NY30 was extended northward over NY10's former alignment by way of an overlap with NY8. The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) maintains all but 0.97 miles (1.56km) of NY30's 301-mile (484km) alignment. The only section not maintained by the state is located in the city of Amsterdam, where the route is locally maintained from Prospect Street (two blocks north of NY67) to the northern city line.[3] NY30 begins at an interchange with NY17 in the town of Hancock adjacent to the confluence of the East Branch of the Delaware River and the Beaverkill River. The route follows the East Branch northeast to Downsville, where it meets NY206. NY206 follows NY30 across the East Branch into Catskill Park, where the routes split near Brock Mountain. NY30 exits the park and crosses over the river once more soon after. Near Margaretville, NY30 briefly overlaps NY28 before turning northward toward Roxbury, where the route passes the John Burroughs Memorial State Historic Site.[4] New York Governor David Paterson designated the stretch of NY30 within Margaretville the "David C. Brinkerhoff Memorial Highway", after the New York State Trooper who was slain in pursuit of Travis Trimm near the village on April25, 2007.[5] From Roxbury, NY30 follows the East Branch to Grand Gorge in northeastern Delaware County, where the East Branch comes to an end amidst the mountains. NY30, meanwhile, intersects NY23 in the center of the hamlet.[4] North of Grand Gorge, NY30 crosses into Schoharie County and intersects NY990V, one of four reference routes in New York erroneously signed as a touring route, near the northeastern edge of the Schoharie Reservoir in Gilboa. From NY990V northward, NY30 follows the Schoharie Creek through Schoharie County to Middleburgh, where it intersects NY145. To the north in Schoharie, NY30 meets NY443 before splitting into NY30 and NY30A north of the village, with Schoharie Creek largely following NY30A. While NY30A connects to Interstate88 (I-88) by way of an interchange a short distance to the north, NY30 has no connection to the freeway. Just past I-88, NY30 intersects NY7. Shortly after passing NY7, NY30 enters Schenectady County.[4] In Schenectady County, Schoharie Creek breaks from NY30A and returns to the vicinity of NY30 as it intersects U.S. Route20 (US20) in Esperance. From Esperance northward, the creek becomes roughly equidistant from both NY30 and NY30A as all three entities cross into Montgomery County. Near the northeastern corner of the county, NY30 enters the city of Amsterdam. The route meets the New York State Thruway (I-90) and NY5S via separate interchanges before heading downhill as a four-lane divided highway approaching the Mohawk River (here part of the Erie Canal). Historically, the bridge over the river was a straight line to Market Street, which is visible as one approaches northbound. Segments of downtown Market Street remain in use today. With the 1977 creation of the Amsterdam Mall, NY30, together with NY5 and NY67, were re-routed onto splits.[6][7] After the splits rejoin, NY30 continues on Market Street and leaves the city and, for all purposes, the county.[4] In adjacent Fulton County, NY30 crosses NY29 near Broadalbin, then curves gently to the east after an intersection with County Route155 (CR155), a historical routing of NY29. 0.25 miles (0.40km), NY30 turns left toward Mayfield; CR155 continues eastward. The concurrency between the two routes is unsigned.[4] NY30 historically followed School Street through the village of Mayfield. The new routing has it heading toward Riceville, where NY30A rejoins NY30. Here, the Adirondack Trail begins as NY30 turns right, following the right-of-way of NY30A into Adirondack Park shortly before entering Mayfield.[4] NY30 runs through the Adirondacks, accessing communities such as Speculator, Blue Mountain Lake, and Tupper Lake as a scenic byway named the Adirondack Trail.[4][8] From Wells to Speculator, NY30 is concurrent to NY8, then with NY28 from Indian Lake to Blue Mountain Lake. Between Blue Mountain Lake and Long Lake, NY30 is concurrent with the eastern third of NY28N.[4] Near Tupper Lake, it skirts the boundary between Franklin and Saint Lawrence for a considerable distance before entering Tupper Lake and intersecting NY3. The two routes overlap to Harrietstown, where NY30 splits from NY3 and heads north along a series of lakes, including Upper Saranac Lake and Meacham Lake. North of Duane, NY30 exits Adirondack Park and heads north towards Malone. Within the village, NY30 briefly overlaps US11. The Adirondack Trail ends at the east end of the overlap. The route continues north out of the village to the Canadian border in Constable, where it becomes Route138 upon entering Quebec.[4] Route30 made up part of the privately-owned Middletown and Roxbury Turnpike. The turnpike, which accessed the villages of Middletown and Roxbury, was created in 1808.[9] The highway was about 23 miles (37km) long, as that is the current stretch of Route30 from Middletown to Roxbury.[2] The stretch of Route30 from Middleburgh to Schoharie was also once part of the Middleburgh and Schoharie Plank Road.[9] Prior to 1930, the modern routing of NY30 carried a large number of designations. Between Margaretville and Grand Gorge in the town of Roxbury, what is now NY30 was designated as part of NY19. From Mayfield north to Malone, most of the current routing of NY30 carried a designation. The portion from the modern junction of NY30 and NY30A in Mayfield to Speculator was part of NY54. From Speculator to Indian Lake, NY30 was the northernmost segment of NY80.[1] Between Indian Lake and Long Lake, NY30 comprised the western half of NY10A.[10] Past Long Lake, NY30 was part of NY10 north to the modern junction of NY30 and NY186 west of Harrietstown. From NY186 to modern NY86 in Paul Smiths, the present alignment of NY30 was unnumbered. Between Paul Smiths and Malone, NY30 was part of NY3. The remainder of NY30 was unnumbered.[1] In the 1930 renumbering, NY30 was largely assigned to its current alignment between the Hancock hamlet of East Branch and Wells, where it terminated at NY8. Past Wells, the modern alignment of NY30 was designated as NY8 to Spectator and as NY10 north to the Canadian border.[1][11] NY10 was truncated southward to NY8 in Arietta c.1960, at which time NY30 was extended north to Quebec along the former alignment of NY10.[12][13] NY30 has been realigned in two areas along its routing. The first realignment was in the Schoharie Valley near the hamlets of Breakabeen and Fultonham. NY30 was originally routed along the base of Toepath Mountain near Fultonham and along a pair of village streets in Breakabeen. In the 1950s, a proposal was made to reroute NY30 onto a new routing in the base of the valley surrounding Schoharie Creek.[citation needed] The proposal was approved, and the new alignment of NY30 opened c.1970.[14][15] The former routing of NY30 from Max V. Shaul State Park near Breakabeen to Fultonham, still visible from the modern alignment of the route, was closed to the public and guardrails were installed to stop motor traffic from using the route. However, biking and walking was still allowed, and the old highway is now a 1.5-mile (2.4km) long trail known as "Old Route30". The trail is not maintained; thus, the quality of the blacktop along Old Route30 has deteriorated over the years. There are significant potholes and overhanging trees, but the path is still traversable. The second realignment of NY30 was in the vicinity of the village of Northville. NY30 originally entered the village by way of Bridge Street and followed Bridge, Main, and Reed streets through the village. It continued along the eastern bank of the Great Sacandaga Lake on what is now Old State Road and Old Northville Road and rejoined its modern alignment in the town of Hope.[11] The route was realigned c.1961 to follow a new highway along the western lakeshore, bypassing Northville entirely.[13][16] The portion of Bridge Street from NY30 to the Northville village line remains state-maintained as NY920H, an unsigned reference route 0.23 miles (0.37km) in length.[2] Farther north, the portion of Old Northville Road from the FultonHamilton county line to its junction with NY30 is maintained by Hamilton County as CR15.[17] NY30A (34.86 miles or 56.10 kilometres) is a loop of NY30, running west of NY30 from north of Schoharie to south of Mayfield through Fultonville, Fonda, Johnstown, and Gloversville.[2] It was assigned in the late 1950s.[13][18]
