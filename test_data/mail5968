Noose is a British crime film released in 1948. It was directed by Edmond T. Grville and starred Carole Landis and Derek Farr[1]. Set in post Second World War Britain, Noose is the story of black market racketeers who face attempts to bring them to justice by an American fashion journalist, her ex-army fiance and a gang of honest toughs from a local gym. Noose was written by Richard Llewellyn, adapted from his own stage play of the same title. The film has been included as part of the cycle of spiv films produced between 1945-50 in Britain[1].
