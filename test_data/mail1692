Silent Football is a group game composed of three major elements: Football, the Quiet Game, and Parliamentary procedure, consisting mainly of the passing of an imaginary football. Silent Football requires little set up: only a quiet space with room enough for three or more players to form a circle, allowing each player to see all other players. Silent Football is commonly played at Unitarian Universalist rallies and cons. In the variations of Silent Football that result in a "loser," one loses by the accumulation of a set number of penance points (set by the Dictator at the beginning of the game (usually 3, 5 or 10). All players are arranged in a circle, and one player is selected, if not already appointed by a higher spiritual power, to be "Brother Dictator", or "Mister Dictator" (or the more capitalist variant: "Mr Commissioner, Sir", or another variant may be "Grand Master". Also used is the Game Master. In 'dirtier' versions, the dictator may be addressed as any combination of 'dick' and 'tater' - i.e.; penis-potato or cock-latka) The Dictator is responsible for running the game, does the majority of the talking, and interprets the rules given his or her certain dictatorial style. While this may include creating, altering, or removing rules, straying too far from the generally accepted rules can result in a quorum of dictatorial challenge. The game begins with each player introducing themselves for the evening (Picking pseudonyms); i.e. Brother "High School Honors Student" or Sister Cockroach. In some variations players are referred to as simply "Player" rather than brother or sister. (In the capitalist version The players are often called "Misters," because in this variation, all of the players are addressed as "Mr., Miss, or Mrs.(insert full first name), in another variation players create nicknames that they must keep every game they ever play.") Pseudonyms may consist of words, motions, or both. Should a pseudonym include both, both the words and the motions must be used. Once everyone is arranged, the Dictator must clear any misunderstandings about the rules with either his own interpretation or arbitrary legislation. In some silent football communities, teaching the basic rules of the game is forbidden. New/prospective players must play/watch a round to learn the rules in those communities, however there is also a fifteen minute rule, which forbids outsiders to watch for more than fifteen minutes, after which time the offending outsider must either join or leave. Also, to keep things less complicated, some players simply say "Silent football is neither silent, nor is it football" when talking about it, unless it is before actually playing in which case rules will be taught. The first offensive move is called the Fwap, also known as a Thwack or Thwap. One performs a fwap by hitting one's knees in a combination of right knee and left knee (some variations turn their hand over, after the hit, in the given direction). One must hit their right knee with their right hand and their left knee with their left hand. Doing otherwise is called a cross fwap, for which a player may receive Penance Points. Every hit of the right knee moves the Silent Football a space to the right. Every hit of the left knee moves the Silent Football one space to the left. One may hit their knees in any combination of rights and lefts with a few restrictions.(Many variants require that the ball movement of the ball must never be reversed by a fwap. IE: If a player fwaps to the right to you, you may not fwap to the left.) The second offensive move is called the Zoom. The Zoom is performed by extending your right hand in a fist and making eye contact with the player to whom you wish to zoom. The player with whom you make eye contact is passed the silent football. Whether or not the direction of the fist must also point to the same person varies among different rules. A variation on this move is performed by putting your right hand by your left ear, and putting your nose in the crook of that elbow (Classic Zoom). The elbow must point towards the person to whom one wishes to zoom, and eye contact must also be made. According to some, you cannot zoom the ball to the person right next to you. A third offensive move is called the Shwah. Many communities do not include this move in their rules for Silent Football. The Shwah is viewed as obnoxious. The Shwah is performed by extending your right hand with your fingers pointed as if holding a small ball in your fingertips and saying very loudly and shrilly "SHWAH!" and making eye contact. The silent football is then passed to the player with whom eye contact was made. An unorthodox move considering the breaking of silence. The Shwah is also unblockable, meaning: A fourth offensive maneuver is called the "Continental". This pass is between the ball carrier and a player that is more than 2 seats away from the carrier on either side. The player in possession of the ball must make direct eye contact with the other player, immediately both players perform a thwack. The first thwack from the ball carrier is to pass the ball to the other player, and the thwack performed by the recipient of the pass is done to pass the ball to a player on either side. A fifth and very commonly used move is the "Shmeed." It is performed by cupping ones right hand on the back of ones neck. And then pointing the elbow of the bent arm at the person who is to receive the ball. You may Shmeed a Shmeed, but you may not Shmeed a Shmeeded Shmeed. For new players the Commissioner commonly uses the three basic moves. The Shrug, the Shmodus, and the Shmeed. The rest of the moves are considered extra and obnoxious in most circles. The first defensive move is the Shrug. The shrug is performed just as the name implies: one raises one's shoulders. The shrug passes the Silent Football back to the player who passed it. The second defensive move is the Shmotus. The move is executed in varying ways among different groups, but its effect is consistent everywhere: the Shmotus returns the silent football to the previous passer. Execution Depending on the group, the Shmotus is performed in one of the following the ways: The Golden Rule This is the most important rule. Breaking this rule will cause you to automatically lose the game. A player may shrug a shrug or Shmotus a Shmotus, but may never shrug a Shmotus or Shmotus a shrug. This divides the universe by 0, which (in some groups) must be recognized by all players by loud yelling and potentially rolling on the ground. While some do not recognize it as an instant loss, many find it to be the worst of the rules to break and a large amount of penance is usually awarded. In some circles, however, the rule is deemed no more important than any other, and a player may shrug a Shmotus, but never Shmotus a shrug. The shrug is the more polite way to refuse possession of the ball, while the Shmotus is more abrasive. It's just rude to face someone's politeness with an abrasive move. Whereas meeting someone's abrasiveness with politeness is accepted. This is commonly remembered as "One can hug a Shmotus, but one cannot Shmotus a hug," or when the move is referred to as a Shrodum, "You can hug a scrotum, but you can't scrotum a hug," is a useful memory tool. If a player must visit the restroom, that player may use the restroom signal: waving their raised hand. The Dictator will simply nod and that person can get up. At the Dictator's discretion, the player may or may not have to wait until the next round of Silent Football motion to rejoin the circle. A player may also request to leave for a few moments. This may or may not be granted by the dictator. Myriad variations and newer moves to the game exist within different communities, sometimes causing the game to become incredibly complicated. One such example is the phenomenon of Wormholes/Parallel Universes[1] (SWUUSI). Another is the "split ball" effect at Ferry Beachcaused by baps and shwees, and used only the Dictator. Often, one cannot find these inventions in play anywhere except the community in which they have become a staple. When the Commissioner is ready to begin the game the Commissioner simply says, "Customary Tip of the Hat," after which everyone repeats "Customary Tip of the Hat" and tips their (imaginary) hats. Another variation is "Hats off," after which all players remove imaginary hats and place them in the center of the circle. Then, the Commissioner may take the "Customary Shroop," [or Schwoop, Shroom,or Sloop] after which everyone repeats "Customary Shroop" [or "Customary Schwoop", "Customary Shroom", or "Customary Sloop"] and takes an imaginary drink from an imaginary, or real if circumstance permits, drinking vessel. Beverages and snacks can exist within the circle; this helps keep games going for hours. The Commissioner can then add any more customary phrases she/he desires, and the group should repeat them as appropriate. When the Commissioner feels enough customary phrases have been spoken, the Commissioner Fwaps or Zooms the ball to someone, beginning the Sacred Silent Football motion. Additionally, the words "The rules are in effect, the ball is now in play" or "Let's play ball" or "The universe is now a closed entity, free speech is now revoked" may be said before the ball is moved. In many forms of Silent Football, the commissioner cannot accuse anyone of an infraction; therefore it is left to the players to inform the commissioner when an error has been made. If a player notices any other player (including the commissioner) break one of the rules of Silent Football, that player may raise his hand to inform The Commissioner of the rule breaking. The commonly accepted procedure for tattling follows: In some circles a player who wishes to tattle, but is ignored by the Dictator, may break the rule of silence and exclaim "abuh" to attract the Dictator's attention. If the Dictator continues to ignore the player they may progress to "abuh awuh" followed by "abuh awuh aduh" and penultimately "abuh awuh a-motherfucking-duh." While the Dictator is still not required to call on the player, abuse of this system is punishable and each step up the chain should indicate a more severe infraction has taken place. The fundamental rule of Silent Football is *One may never use any pronouns. (In some variations, pronouns referring to oneself are legal, but not in other variations During tattling (the only socially acceptable time to speak), The game is limited to the people playing in the circle. If a player reacts to a person or thing outside of the circle, he is said to be reacting to hallucinations which are the result of hallucinogens and will be awarded penance points. An exception to this rule is that if a hallucination enters the circle they may materialize, and players may ask Mr. Dictator to have something done about the intruders (commonly lick and or tackle said hallucination). Any entities not in the game are hallucinations, and thus are referred to out of game as the Peanut Gallery, also known as Poltergeists and Savages and Outside forces. It must be remembered that the Peanut Gallery formally does not exist; it is informal to refer to the peanut gallery in game play and penance points may be issued for such hallucinations. The Peanut Gallery can (and very likely will, given the chance) interfere with the players in whatever ways they wish. Random flailing motions are always allowed in the universe of silent football (IE: Flailing the arms trying to get particularly annoying hallucinations to go away). The Commissioner is allowed the ability to change names; changing one's name to Miss Cleo gives him/her the ability to perceive the hallucinations without receipt of penance. In some circles, the Commissioner is simply immune to all attempts of the peanut gallery/poltergeists, and can interact with the outside world as s/he pleases. At points within a game, many players may be bothered by the acts of the Peanut Gallery. In this case, a player denoted "Miss Cleo" (or the Commissioner in circles where there is no concept of a "Miss Cleo" player) has the unique ability to incite Holy Jihad (otherwise known as a "witch hunt"), an action in which the Peanut Gallery suddenly materializes within the game, and therefore can be tackled, beaten, or otherwise punished for clearly having been distracting before they existed formally. This action is particularly justified if such hallucinations have blocked players' sight of each others' knees, a necessity for fwappage. In the case of a universe playing without the rule of "Miss Cleo", any player may request to the dictator if a holy jihad may be proclaimed on a certain very annoying communal hallucination. The dictator will then grant or deny the request. Once one has attained a set amount penance points (usually between 5 and 10) one has lost. The loser must perform an embarrassing action decided by the winners. However, this cannot involve unwilling third parties. For instance, a penance which involved a sexual encounter would require the consent of the others involved in the penance. However, most penance is generally mildly annoying rather than harsh (One famous penance is the losing player must eat their next meal(s) with only a spoon and no other utensils.) Another example of a punishment is being forced to say Babe after every sentence. The Quiet Game aspect prohibits any player from making any noise including laughter, talking, movement, chewing, slurping, etc. Only the commissioner may speak. The only sounds allowed and encouraged are bodily functions including the cough, sneeze, burp, and fart. However each of these sounds must be covered by a high pitched "Whoop." For instance, should a player cough twice, he must follow the noise with two whoops, three sneezes would result in three whoops, and so on. Even Silent-But-Deadly bodily functions MUST be followed by a quiet "Whoop" in order to warn the other players. An optional corollary measure in instances when a losing player is to perform a penance is known as the Goldberg Parachute. Should a player find that a particular penance is too harsh, they may exercise an option for an alternative penance to be conceived in place of the questionable act. The intent is to remove the possibility of personal psychological upset from a player's participation. In certain Northern Californian circles, this is alternately known as a Beth, though this term carries a negative context as it implies that the player wishes to play the game without any risk of penance, whether harsh or agreeable. A player who leaves the game without permission to do so following the assignment of penance is certainly and irrefutably a Beth. In some circles, rather than having a "Brother Dictator" there is instead: A custom that has been set in the SAYF community is that whenever people outside of the game intrude with rude intent, the patrons of the game cover their head with their arms, and shout, "Dirty savages!" (variations) and/or hiss. Some silent football communities dont have a strict "no pronoun" rule and instead adhere to the following: When speaking, no player may use pronouns such as "he" "she" "it" "they" "we" "us" "you" "him" "her" "hers" "his" etcetera, except for first person singular pronouns, "I" "me" "my" "myself" and "mine," and words which are not always pronouns, such as the demonstrative pronouns "this" "that" and "those." And some silent football communities have a different variation on the "no pronoun" rule as well; if one wishes to use a pronoun instead of another player's name then they must say "quote" pronoun "unquote". 2. http://www.bc.edu/bands -- Silent Football is the official game of BC bOp! - the Jazz Ensemble of Boston College
