International Game Developers Association (IGDA) is the professional society for over 10,000 video and computer game developers worldwide. It is incorporated in the United States as a non-profit organization. Its stated mission is "To advance the careers and enhance the lives of game developers."[1] In recognition of the wide-ranging, multidisciplinary nature of interactive entertainment, there are no barriers to entry. Any person who considers him- or herself to be a game developer may join. Gordon Bellamy became executive director in August 2010 replacing Joshua Caulfield. The original Executive Director of the IGDA, Jason Della Rocca, stepped down in March 2009.[2][3][4] Chapters are intended to provide an informal way to connect game developers within local communities. Chapters vary greatly in size and meeting attendance. They provide forums, for example, for discussions on current issues in the computer gaming industry and demos of the latest games. A task force has been created to consider chapter formalization, but no such formalities as official membership currently exist for IGDA chapters. Regional chapters may collaborate on events, as with the GameX Industry Summit.[5] Special Interest Groups, better known as SIGs, are intended to spark developer interest in a specific topics or disciplines. For example, the Game Education SIG has a stated mission "To create a community resource that will strengthen the academic membership of the IGDA while enhancing the education of future and current game developers." Some SIGs sponsor events, such as the Global Game Jam.[6] Committees are generally formed by the IGDA to conduct research into a subject, normally for a short period, leading to a single report. Some, however, are semi-permanent, and produce yearly reports. Some of these reports lead to gaming industry standards.
