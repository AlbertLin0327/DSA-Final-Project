"Me Plus One" is a pop song written by producer Richard X and songwriter Hannah Robinson for Norwegian singer Annie's 2004 debut album Anniemal. The song was written about former Spice Girls member Geri Halliwell. The lyrics refer to a "wannabe senorita" who needs to realise she's "got to let it go".[1] The song received acclaim from music critics. The song appears on Popjustice: 100% Solid Pop Music. "Me Plus One" was written by Richard X and Hannah Robinson in response to former Spice Girls member Geri Halliwell. Richard X and Robinson had written another song called "Some Girls", later a hit single for Rachel Stevens. Warp Records and Simon Fuller contacted Richard X by email to ask that he give the song to Halliwell or Stevens, respectively, to record. He agreed to have Stevens record the song after Richard Curtis asked about using the song for Sport Relief 2004.[2] When Halliwell found out that the writers were having Stevens record the song, she locked herself in her car in an attempt to change their minds, and she later wrote Richard X a love song. The aftermath of the decision for Stevens to record the song became the subject of "Me Plus One" from Annie's 2004 album Anniemal.[3] The song samples the barks of Halliwell's dog Harry. The lyrics of "Me Plus One" detail a girl who dreams of fame but can't achieve it. She fails to be accepted into the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts. The verse two says the "wannabe seorita met a group of likely girls [...] but it didn't make her happy", referencing Halliwell's rise to stardom with the Spice Girls and her subsequent unhappiness with the group. The song's middle-eight references the "Some Girls" situation  "take a look at yourself, get out of the car, it's time to let go - it's gone."[3] "Me Plus One" received acclaim from music critics. Scott Plagenhoef's review for Pitchfork Media named it "winking" and "seductive".[4] The Stranger compared the track to Human League,[5] while Tiny Mix Tapes referred to the song as "a gorgeous day-glo dance party."[6] Stylus Magazine described the song as "a tale of sulky pop princesses trying to be like the Chewing Gum queen and getting smashed on the rocks".[7] These are the formats and track listings of major single releases of "Me Plus One".
