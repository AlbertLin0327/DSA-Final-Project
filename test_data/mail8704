"Hollywood" is a song by American singer-songwriter Madonna. The song was written and produced by Madonna and Mirwais Ahmadza for her ninth studio album, American Life (2003). It was released as the second single from the album on July 14, 2003 by Maverick Records. "Hollywood" is a folk rock song that lyrically refers and criticizes the life style of district Hollywood. It received mixed reviews from music critics, who considered the song as catchy, despite criticizing its lyrical content. "Hollywood" attained moderate success, reaching number two in the United Kingdom, while placing within the top ten in Canada, Finland, and Italy. In the United States, the song failed to enter on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Madonna's first single since 1982's "Burning Up" to do so. An accompanying music video, directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino, portrays Madonna in different styles and fashions, highlighting the highs and lows of Hollywood. "Hollywood" was first performed in an acoustic version along with "American Life" and "Mother and Father" on the 2003 American Life Promo Tour. On August 27, 2003, Madonna opened the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards performing a medley of "Like a Virgin/Hollywood" with Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Missy Elliott. During the performance, Madonna kissed Spears and Aguilera on the lips, generating strong reaction from the media. The song was later used as a dancers interlude on the 2004 Re-Invention World Tour. American Life became Madonna's final studio album with Maverick Records, and marked the end of an eleven-year recording history with the label.[1][2] In an interview with VH1 Madonna discussed her motivations behind the record discussing her 20 years in the industry and stating that "material things" were unimportant and she also stated, "I look back at the 20 years behind me and I realized that a lot of things that I'd valued weren't important" in response to the non-materialistic themes of the record.[3] To counter illegal Internet downloads of the album's songs both before and after the album's release, Madonna's associates created a number of false song files of similar length and size. Some of these files delivered a brief message from Madonna saying "What the fuck do you think you're doing?" followed by minutes of silence.[4] Madonna's website hacker add a message appearing on the Main Page, saying "This is what the fuck I think I'm doing..." followed by download links for each of the album's songs.[4] The website was closed after the attack for about 15 hours.[4] The album has been deemed by some as a concept album featuring political themes based around the United States. Whilst talking to MTV she discussed the political themes within the record saying; "I feel like America has changed over the years and that a lot of our values seem to be materially oriented and so superficial. And we all seem to be obsessed with fame just for the sake of fame, no matter what  sell your soul to the devil if that's what it takes. And we're also completely obsessed with the way we look. And I bought into a lot of that, so a lot of the record, especially the first three songs [American Life, Hollywood, I'm So Stupid] are just like, "What was I thinking?"".[5] "Hollywood" was chosen as the second single from the album, being released on June 14, 2003 by Maverick Records.[6] "Hollywood" is a "bouncy folk-rock tune", as noted by James Hannaham of Spin.[7] The song is introduced with sounds of tweeting birds before an acoustic guitar starts a four chord sequence that has been compared of that of the band Red Hot Chilli Peppers.[8] The texture grows as drums and synths until after a minute the instrumental is pulled leaving just Madonna's vocals and the acoustic guitar accompaniment.[8] The final sequence is another rap part, as is featured in "American Life" with the repeated phrase "Push the button". Lyrically, it discusses American culture and greed focusing on Hollywood as a place of stars and illusory dreams,[8][7] with Madonna singing in the bridge of the song, "Music stations always play the same songs/I'm bored with the concept of right and wrong".[9] Contemporary author Ben Shapiro noted the verse "seems to be Madonna's credo. Her purposeful degradation of morality has led to monumental success for her-and created a monumentally bad influence for her teenage fans."[10] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted Madonna's vocals in the song are "high-pitched [to sound like a] little-girl", with the intention to "underline the notion of innocence lost".[11] The instruments used on "Hollywood" are similar to the ones used on the other songs from American Life.[6] Several remixes of "Hollywood" done by DJs such as Jacques Lu Cont, The Micronauts, Paul Oakenfold, Deepsky and Victor Calderone, were included on physical releases of the single around the world.[13] In August 2003, the song was remixed with "Into the Groove" and performed with Missy Elliott under the title "Into the Hollywood Groove" as part of a promotional campaign for clothing retailer GAP.[14] Copies of the promotional CD were given away to customers, and were not available for individual purchase.[15][16] An extended version, "The Passengerz Mix", was also included on the remix album Remixed & Revisited (2003).[12] A promotional video for the remix was also shot. Rob Walker of Slate considered the video "interesting because Madonna has always been praised as much for her ability to market herself as for her actual talent as a singer and performer". However, he noted that "[the singer] can't even get an actual commercial right. Maybe Madonna really is over."[17] A parody of the commercial which poked fun at Madonna's age was featured on MADtv.[18] "Hollywood" was also remixed by American DJ duo Blow-Up. The remix was set to be included on Madonna's second remix album planned for 2004; however, it remains unreleased.[19] A Billboard review considered it as a "funky dark remix".[19] "Hollywood" received mixed reviews from music critics. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted "Madonna exclusively divulges [in the song] that not everyone who wants to make it in the movies succeeds."[11] Michael Hubbard of musicOMH commented "it would be even better if the lazy lyrics (where just about everything rhymes with "Hollywood"  especially itself) had been dispensed with."[6] He also added that "it has the name Madonna on it so it will sell, but it's hardly vintage stuff. Time for some musical reinvention to go with the incessant changes of image."[6] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine thought "following up 'American Life' with 'Hollywood' was nearly as ballsy" due to its lyrical content.[9] Jude Adam of Third Way Magazine gave the song a positive review, considering it as "quirky, sunny, and sweet in perfect mesures," adding that "Hollywood" is "the kind of pop tune that instantly transports you to California, driving along Santa Monica Boulevard with the roof down."[20] Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club considered the song as "actually catchy".[21] "Hollywood" failed to enter the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, or the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. It was the first time since 1982's "Burning Up" that a Madonna single did not appear on either chart. However it peaked at number one on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play and Hot Dance Singles Sales component charts.[22] The song did manage to break the top twenty in the singles charts of many other countries in which it was released.[23] It peaked at number two in the UK Singles Chart.[24] The music video for "Hollywood" was filmed at Universal Studios in Universal City, California and directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino, who previously worked with Madonna on her videos for "Justify My Love" (1990), "Human Nature" (1995), "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" (1996), and "Don't Tell Me" (2000). In the US, it premiered on June 23, 2003 on VH1 (along with a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the video), June 24 on yahoo.com and June 27 on MTV. Two official remix videos of "Hollywood" were also released. The "Aviddiva Remix" created by Dustin Robertson featured unreleased footage from the video shoot. The second remix video entitled the "Paul Oakenfold Edit" was released by Warner Bros. Records as a promo-only and consisted mostly of clips from the original video. The video features Madonna in different styles and fashions highlighting the highs and lows of "Hollywood". After the release of the music video for Hollywood, the son of French fashion photographer Guy Bourdin filed a federal lawsuit that accused Madonna of ripping off the work of his acclaimed father. The copyright lawsuit against Madonna, claimed that her video for the song "Hollywood" was a blatant visual theft job of his father's iconic images. "It's one thing to draw inspiration; it's quite another to simply plagiarize the heart and soul of my father's work," Bourdin said at the time. Included in Bourdin's federal complaint were side-by-side comparisons of his father's work with images with stills from the "Hollywood" video. Details of the financial settlement are confidential and Madonna acknowledged no wrongdoing in her liberal appropriation of the images Bourdin's lawyer, John Koegel, said the parties reached a "very, very successful settlement," adding that terms of the deal did not allow him to discuss exact dollar amounts.[25] To start marketing American Life, Madonna performed the American Life Promo Tour. A performance on Tower's Fourth Street in Manhattan was presented to around 400 people,[26] and featured acoustic performances of "American Life", "Mother and Father" and "Hollywood".[26] On August 27, 2003, American recording artist Britney Spears opened the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards performing a medley of "Like a Virgin/Hollywood" with Madonna, Christina Aguilera and Missy Elliott.[27] The performance started with Spears appearing on stage on top of a giant wedding cake while wearing a wedding gown and veil; she sang the first few lines of "Like a Virgin" before Aguilera appeared from behind the cake and joined her.[28] Madonna then emerged from the cake wearing a black coat and a hat and started singing "Hollywood" before proceededing to kiss Spears and Aguilera on the lips.[29] Missy Elliott came out from a wedding chapel to sing her song "Work It" halfway through the performance.[29] The kiss generated strong reaction from the media. When asked about it, Madonna revealed, "I am kissing [Britney] and passing my energy on to her. Like kind of a mythological fairytale."[30] The performance was listed by Blender magazine as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history.[31] MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment in the history of the MTV Video Music Awards.[32] In Madonna's Re-Invention World Tour (2004), a remix interlude of "Hollywood" featured a breakdancer, a firedancer, a bellydancer, a tapdancer and a skateboarder. The screens displayed animations of tarot cards.[33] On the same tour, the performance of "Into the Groove" contained samples from the remix "Into the Hollywood Groove".[34] Credits for "Hollywood" are adapted from American Life liner notes.[41]
