Rob Roy (1817) is a historical novel by Walter Scott. It is narrated by Frank Osbaldistone, the son of an English merchant who travels first to the North of England, and subsequently to the Scottish Highlands to collect a debt stolen from his father. On the way he encounters the larger-than-life title character of Rob Roy MacGregor. Though Rob Roy is not the lead character (in fact the narrative does not move to Scotland until half way through the book) his personality and actions are key to the development of the novel. The novel was loosely adapted into a film in 1995, starring Liam Neeson, Tim Roth, and Jessica Lange. The story takes place just before the 1715 Jacobite Rising, with much of Scotland in turmoil. Frank Osbaldistone, the narrator, quarrels with his father and is sent to stay with an uncle, Sir Hildebrand Osbaldistone, in Northumberland. Frank falls in love with Diana Vernon, Sir Hildebrand's niece, whose father has been forced to go into hiding because of his Jacobite sympathies. Frank's cousin, Rashleigh, steals important documents vital to the honour and economic solvency of Frank's father, William, and Frank pursues Rashleigh to Scotland. Several times his path crosses the mysterious and powerful figure Robert Roy MacGregor, known as Rob Roy, an associate of Diana's uncle Sir Hildebrand. There is much confusion as the action shifts to the beautiful mountains and valleys around Loch Lomond. A British army detachment is ambushed and there is bloodshed. All Sir Hildebrand's sons but Rashleigh are killed in the Jacobite Rising, and Rashleigh too meets a bloody end. Following this, Frank inherits Sir Hildebrand's property and marries Diana. Robert Louis Stevenson loved the novel from childhood, regarding it as the best novel of the greatest of all novelists.[1] The novel is a brutally realistic depiction of the social conditions in Highland and Lowland Scotland in the early 18th century. Some of the dialogue is in broad Scottish, and the novel includes a glossary of Scottish words. Rob Roy was written from the spring of 1817 and published on Hogmanay of that year. Like Scott's novel Waverley, it was published anonymously and came in three volumes. The demand for the novel was huge and a whole ship from Leith to London contained nothing but an entire edition of it[citation needed]. Furthermore, Rob Roy was written at a time when many Europeans started regretting colonialism and imperialism as reports circulated back of horrendous atrocities towards indigenous cultures.[original research?] It was also a time when debates raged about the slave trade, the British occupation of India, and, more relevant to the novel, the disastrous effect of the Highland Clearances. during this era, William Wordsworth wrote The Conventions of Cintra, praising Spanish and Portuguese resistance to Napoleonic force; Lord Byron would go on to praise Amazonian women in Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, inverting the "polite" norms of femininity that the modern "civilized" world placed on them; and, finally, Scott would write about similar events in The Visions of Don Roderick. The term "guerrilla" came about during this period, due to the influence of the Peninsular War.[2] Francis "Frank" Osbaldistone tells the story of his adventures as a young man at the beginning of the 18th century, wherein he falls in love with a beautiful young woman, gallantly rides to Scotland to save his estranged fathers reputation and business, and becomes involved with the remarkable Highlander, Rob Roy, even as a Jacobite rebellion breaks out in Scotland and northern England. His tale begins with his return to his father William's merchant house of Osbaldistone and Tresham in Crane Alley, London, from an apprenticeship in a French associate's business. There he meets with his business-minded father's anger and disappointment, since he has been more preoccupied with writing poetry than learning the business, much to his father's disgust. Owen, the Head Clerk of Osbaldistone and Tresham and a long time friend of the family, attempts to persuade him to follow his father's wishes and succeed in the business. In spite of this, he decides to follow his own way, assuming his father will support him. Instead, William decides to send him to stay with his uncle, Sir Hildebrand Osbaldistone, in Northumberland, near the border with Scotland. William was originally disinherited (for reasons unknown) in favour of his younger brother Hildebrand, who has inherited both the family fortune and the family seat of Osbaldistone Manor, while William, turned out of the house to make his own way, has built a successful business with his trading company in London. Frank sets out for Northumberland and joins a group of travellers both for protection and company. During the long journey, he observes that one of the travellers is nervous and protective of a box that he carries. Frank begins to tease the traveller, Morris, pretending to assume an interest in the mysterious box. Soon, the party is joined by a confident and sociable Scottish cattle dealer, Campbell. They eat and drink and discuss politics together at an inn and then part ways, not without Morris entreating Campbell to travel with him to provide protection, since Campbell has recounted how he thwarted two highwaymen single-handedly. After Frank parts from the company and approaches his destination he encounters a fox hunt in full flight. A lovely young huntress, dressed and mounted like a man greets him and guesses his identity. Frank is immediately smitten by the young woman, noting her intelligence and beauty along with her independent manner. She introduces herself as Diana "Die" Vernon, a relative by marriage of Sir Hildebrand, and takes him to Osbaldistone Manor, a large, rambling and run-down old castle that is filled with massive old furniture, rusted suits of armour and hunting trophies. Frank meets old Sir Hildebrand, a former Cavalier, and his five dissolute older sons, all described by Die as given entirely to drinking and sporting. At dinner, he meets the youngest brother, Rashleigh, who, unlike his father and brothers, is sober, charming and erudite. Frank notes a connection between Die and Rashleigh. Die explains that Rashleigh, a scholar intended for the priesthood, is her tutor. Later, after encountering Andrew Fairservice the gardener, a rustic and loquacious Scotsman, Frank is warned by Die that he has been charged with robbery and that the local Justice of the Peace, Squire Inglewood, has a warrant for his arrest. Rather than flee to Scotland as suggested by Die, he determines to visit the Squire to protest his innocence. Die guides him there and they encounter Rashleigh, who claims to have been pleading Frank's case. After meeting the convivial old squire and declaring his innocence, Frank confronts his accuser, who is none other than Morris. Morris, actually a government paymaster, has been robbed of his mysterious box, which apparently contained gold for the English troops in the area. The implications of Franks prior interest in Morris box on the journey north become apparent. Upon Franks vehement declaration of innocence, and the Judges sympathetic acquittal, Morris immediately abandons his suit against Frank, but Jobson, the Squire's pedantic and officious clerk wants to pursue the matter on legal principle. After diverting Jobson by sending him on wild goose chase, Rashleigh departs and quickly returns with the cattle-dealer, Campbell. Campbell witnesses truthfully that he was at the scene of the robbery and did not see Frank. Freed by the Squire, but under a cloud of suspicion, Frank returns to Osbaldistone manor. Consumed with jealousy after discovering that Rashleigh was in serious consideration for Die's hand in marriage, Frank recklessly gets drunk with the family after Die exits, and strikes Rashleigh during an argument. In the morning Frank apologizes sincerely but thinks that Rashleigh's too-quick forgiveness rings false. Rashleigh leaves Osbaldistone Manor to take Frank's place at Osbaldistone and Tresham, but not before Diana warns Frank that Rashleigh is a subtle and dangerous conniver, and has her under his power. However, she will not reveal why. With Rashleigh gone, Frank begins to tutor Die and falls even more deeply in love with her. In between hours in the library with Die, he converses with Andrew Fairservice and learns much about goings on at the Manor: there are suspicious visitations by shadowy persons unknown; the servants fear a ghost which resembles Die's grandfather and haunts the library; and a mysterious Catholic priest, Father Vernon, is said to visit often but is never seen. Frank gets a letter from Owen and only then realizes that none of his letters have reached London, including one warning of Rashleigh's dubious character. His worst fears are realized when Die informs him that while William has been on the continent, Rashleigh has absconded with financial instruments vital to Osbaldistone and Tresham's solvency. Frank determines to leave immediately for Scotland to find Owen and track down Rashleigh, and parts with Diana, thinking he is never to see her again, since she is destined to live in a convent due to a family compact in which she has no say, as a result of refusing to marry any of Sir Hildebrands sons. He enlists Andrew Fairservice as his servant and guide and hurries to Glasgow to find Owen and catch Rashleigh, who has now been revealed to be a Jacobite agent and agitator. They lodge in Glasgow, and during a visit to a famous kirk recommended by Andrew, an unseen stranger presses a note into Frank's hand telling him he is in danger and to meet him on a well-known bridge at midnight for information. Frank meets the stranger who conveys him to the tolbooth (jail), which they enter without being challenged. Inside they find Owen, who is overjoyed to see Frank. Owen has been thrown in jail due to the actions of Osbaldistone and Tresham's favoured Scottish trading partner, MacVitie, who has maliciously made him a debtor on behalf of his now insolvent employer. Bailie Nicol Jarvie, a Glasgow magistrate who is also a Scottish partner of Osbaldistone and Tresham, arrives at the jail. The mysterious stranger finally reveals himself to be Campbell, whom Jarvie recognizes as his kinsman, Rob Roy McGregor. On Rob's promise to repay Jarvie 1000 Scots pounds that he owes him, Jarvie frees Owen, and allows Frank and Campbell to leave. It turns out that the absent turnkey (jailer), who has let them pass in freely, is Rob Roy's man, Dougal. Before disappearing with Dougal, Rob tells Frank to meet him in his Highland home and suggests that Bailie Jarvie should accompany him to collect his gold. While Jarvie prepares for the journey, Frank takes a walk to the University grounds, where he spies Rashleigh walking with Morris and MacVitie. Frank confronts Rashleigh and they duel, but before the fight becomes deadly, it is broken up by Rob Roy. After Rob sends Rashleigh away, he tells Frank to meet him at the Clachan of Aberfoyle in the Highlands and that he will have information for him there. Frank now realizes that Rob's affairs are deeply entwined with his own and concludes that he has had a long association with Osbaldistone Manor, particularly with Rashleigh and Die. Frank, Jarvie and Andrew ride to the Clachan, where they find a rude country inn. Tired, cold and hungry, they insist on entering, despite the objections of the landlady and the other guests, particularly three men in plaids, drinking brandy at a table. A brief brawl ensues between the two parties, which is broken up by a fourth Highlander who has been sleeping on the floor. This man disappears, but not before Frank recognizes him as Dougal, Rob's man. Frank and Jarvie begin to converse with the men in plaid, and find they are the leaders of bands of armed men. Two are Highlanders, and the second is a Lowland chief, Duncan Galbraith, who heads the Lennox militia. All have been enlisted by the English army to find and arrest Rob Roy. Called outside to speak with Andrew, Frank is passed a note by the landlady. The note is from Rob who has wisely avoided the Clachan, and in it he again tells Frank to meet him at his home. Suddenly an English patrol enters the inn, dragging Dougal with them. Frank and Jarvie are arrested as they fit the description of the two people that the patrol is looking for. The soldiers force Dougal to lead them to Rob's lair, bringing Frank, Jarvie and Andrew along. However, they are soon ambushed by Highlanders, and the patrol is disarmed. Dougal, playing the frightened fool, has led them into a trap. The leader of the Highlanders is a fierce, proud Highland lady, armed like a man. Her band is composed mostly of old men, women and children. The lady declares herself to be Helen, Rob's wife. After declaiming the wrongs done to her and her clan, she produces the unfortunate Morris, now a hostage, and he is callously thrown into the nearby loch. Helen is then approached by a band of Highland fighting men, fully armed, and led by Rob's two sons. They report that Rob has been captured by the Duke's army. After Jarvie successfully appeals for clemency for them from the lady, pleading kinship, Frank is sent as emissary to the Duke's camp. He finds Rob is tied up and is to be executed. The Duke's army sets off, but Rob easily escapes, as does Frank in the confusion that ensues. He begins to walk in the dark night along a path through the forest back to the Clachan. To his great surprise, he meets Diana and a stranger, a much older nobleman, riding on the path. Die gives him the missing papers that Rashleigh had held, and bids him one final adieu. Frank assumes that the man this is Diana's husband, and sadly continues on. He is overtaken by Rob who takes him to his home, after expressing anger at Morris' murder. There, Jarvie and Andrew are already ensconced. Accounts are settled all around, with Jarvie declaring Osbaldistone and Tresham to be cleared of debt, due to the recovered papers, and Rob repaying Jarvie 1000 pounds of gold louis d'or. During the night, while the others sleep, Rob tells Frank of how he and Rashleigh robbed Morris - a lark for Rob as an accomplished cattle-thief and blackmailer, but serious business for Rashleigh as a Jacobite agent. But by now Rashleigh has become a turncoat to save his skin and fled to Stirling as a traitor to the Jacobite cause. More importantly for Frank, Rob reveals that the older man travelling with Diana is not her husband, but her father, Sir Richard Vernon, a notable supporter of the Pretender, King James. It is he who was the mysterious figure at Osbaldistone Manor, posing as Father Vaughn and the real man behind the ghost in the library. Frank and Jarvie are sent on their way homeward to Glasgow, after an emotional farewell from Rob and Helen and their clansmen. There, Frank is greeted with delight and forgiveness by his father, who has come north to settle accounts, having prospered while on the continent. In gratitude for his assistance and even-handedness, William rewards Bailie Jarvie with the commercial accounts that he has promptly stripped from McVitie. After returning to London, Frank levies a company of soldiers and rides north to support King George's cause as the Jacobite rebellion breaks out into war. But the Rebellion is quickly suppressed and after returning to London, he learns of the downfall and deaths of Sir Hildebrand and his older sons through extravagance and misfortune, and finds himself heir to Osbaldistone Manor. Rashleigh, the only remaining son, has been disinherited in favour of Frank as punishment by his father. With Andrew Fairservice, he takes possession of Osbaldistone Manor. Nostalgically selecting the library to sleep in, he finds Diana and her father hiding there, who request sanctuary as they are being hunted due to the failure of the Jacobite uprising. They tell Frank how Sir Richard had been hidden at the Manor, pretending to be a ghost to the superstitious servants, and a Catholic priest to the neighbours. Somehow Rashleigh had gained knowledge of his presence and used it to gain control over Diana. They plan to escape, but it is too late, as Rashleigh arrives with Jobson and the local constables, bringing a warrant to take possession of the Manor and arrest the Vernons. Frank and the Vernons are easily captured and prepare to be taken away in a carriage. But barely have they started before Rob Roy springs an ambush, freeing them all and killing Rashleigh, as Jobson flees with his reputation ruined. That is the last they see of Rob Roy, as Frank, the new Lord of Osbaldistone Manor, returns to London to take up his career at Osbaldistone and Tresham, and marry his beloved Diana, while Sir Richard escapes to safety on the Continent.
