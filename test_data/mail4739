Amlab Conung (died c. 875) (Old Norse: lfr) was a Norse or Norse-Gael leader in Ireland and Scotland in the years after 850. Together with his brothers mar and Auisle he appears frequently in the Irish annals. The name "Conung" is from the Old Norse konungr and simply means "king".[1] Amlab has often been seen as the same person as Olaf the White of the Landnmabk and other Icelandic sagas. The Irish annals, and the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, are much older than these, and in some respects are source materials for the Icelanders. These say little about Amlab's kin, and what they do say contradicts the Icelandic accounts. The Annals of Ulster report the arrival of Amlab in Ireland in 853: The Fragmentary Annals expand on this: Lochlann, originally Laithlinn or Lothlend, the land where Amlab's father Gofraid, or Gurr, was a king is often identified with Norway, but it is not universally accepted that it had such a meaning in early times.[4] Several historians have proposed instead that in early times, and certainly as late as the battle of Clontarf in 1014, Laithlinn refers to the Norse and Norse-Gael lands in the Hebrides the Isle of Man, the Northern Isles and parts of mainland Scotland.[5] Whatever the original sense, by the twelfth century, when Magnus Barefoot undertook his expedition to the West, it had come to mean Norway.[6] Amlab returned to Ireland by 856 when he and mar are presumed to have aided Mel Sechnaill. "Great warfare between the heathens and Mael Sechnaill, supported by Norse-Irish" is reported by the Annals of Ulster.[7] In 857 Amlab and mar "inflicted a rout on Caitill the Fair and his Norse-Irish in the lands of Munster.[8]" Although there is no certain evidence to suggest that this Caitill is the same person as the Ketill Flatnose of later sagas, it has been suggested that they are the same person.[9] By 859 Amlab and mar were aiding Cerball mac Dnlainge, King of Osraige, against Mel Sechnaill, plundering in Meath. They may also have joined with ed Finnliath, who succeeded Mel Sechnaill as High King of Ireland, in raiding Meath again in 862, by which time Amlab was married to a daughter of ed. In 864, Conchobar mac Donnchado, the King of Mide, was put to death by drowning on Amlab's orders. Amlab and his brother Auisle "went with the foreigners of Ireland and Scotland to Fortriu, plundered the entire Pictish country and took away hostages from them" in either 864 or 866. The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba appears to say that they overwintered in Scotland.[10] ed Finnliath, at about this time, was engaged in destroying Viking "longphorts", or encampments, along the north coasts of Ireland, a campaign that may have been made easier by the absence of Amlab and Auisle's army, then in eastern Scotland. A family dispute resulted in Auisle's death in 867, apparently killed by Amlab, and this may have encouraged Cenntig mac Gathne, king of the Logis of modern County Laois, to destroy a longphort at Clondalkin that year, and then to raid Dublin itself.[11] In 870, Amlab returned to Scotland with mar and laid siege to Dumbarton Rock, chief fortress of the Britons of Strathclyde. They captured it after a siege of four months, returning to Dublin in 871 with 200 ships and they "brought with them in captivity a great prey of Angles, Britons and Picts.[12] A siege of this duration was exceptional, and the captives may have included the king of Alt Clut, Artgal, who according to the Annals of Ulster the next year was "slain by the counsel of Causantn mac Cineda", or Constantine I, probably meaning that Constantine refused to pay ransom for the captured king of Strathclyde. These informative entries in the Annals of Ulster help to understand the short reference in the Chronicle of the Kings of Scotland, version A, which says that Amlab returned "at the head of 100 [ships?], [and was] killed by Constantine". According to the Annals of Ulster it was Artgal who was killed by Constantine.[13]" In the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, it is said that Amlab returned to Lochlann to aid his father in a war in 871.[14] With this, he disappears from the Irish annals. According to the Pictish Chronicle, he died around 874 during a protracted campaign against Constantine I in Scotland: ...after two years Amlaib, with his people, laid waste Pictavia; and he dwelt there from 1 January until the feast of Saint Patrick [17 March]. Again in the third year Amlaib, while collecting tribute, was killed by Constantine. A short while after that battle was fought in his 14th year at Dollar between the Danes and the Scots, the Scots were annihilated at Atholl. The Norsemen spent a whole year in Pictavia.[15] Olaf the White was said to have been married to Aud the Deep-Minded, daughter of Ketil Flatnose, a son, Thorstein the Red, being born of the marriage. In the Annals of Ulster for the year 875, Thorstein is referred to as Oistn in the following excerpt: "U875.4 - Oistn son of Amlab, king of the Norsemen, was deceitfully killed by Albann." Aud however does not appear in the Irish sources.[16] Amlab Conung is said in the Fragmentary Annals to have been a son-in-law of ed Finnliath mac Nill. Elsewhere the Fragmentary Annals, when reporting the death of isle, refer to "the daughter of Cined" as Amlab's wife. It is suggested that the reference to ed is mistaken, and that Amlab's wife was a daughter of Cined mac Conaing, who had been drowned by Mel Sechnaill in 851.[17] An alternative suggestion is that the Cined in question is Cined mac Ailpn (known in English as Kenneth MacAlpin, which would have made Amlab a brother-in-law of his killer Constantine I, a son of Kenneth).[18] A number of sons of Amlab are known. Of these, Carlus was killed at the battle of Cell ua nDaigri in 868, fighting alongside Flann mac Conaing, brother and successor of Cined, who is suggested to have been Amlab's father-in-law. Therefore it is likely that Carlus was fighting alongside his maternal relatives.[19] Oistin was killed in 875 "by Halfdan, by stratagem."[20]
