 Il pleut, il pleut, bergre (French pronunciation:[il pl il pl b], It's raining, shepherdess) is a French song taken from the operetta Laure et Ptrarque, written in 1780 by Fabre d'glantine. The music was written by Louis-Victor Simon. The shepherdess to which the song refers is the French queen Marie Antoinette who loved to play the shepherdess in the Hameau de la reine of the Palace of Versailles. The rain and the storm coming could be an allusion to the troubles that led to the French Revolution. It was sung for the creation of the National Guard after Bastille Day. Some years later, d'glantine hummed it on his way to the guillotine. The first title of the song was Le Retour aux champs ("Back to the fields") before getting its current title in 1787. It is also known as The Storm.
