Conus dalli, common name Dall's cone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.[2] Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of "stinging" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all. The size of an adult shell varies between 32 mm and 80 mm. The spire is indistinctly grooved. The body whorl is obscurely spirally ribbed below. The color of the shell is yellowish brown, with reddish brown longitudinal stripes, interrupted by four revolving bands of white spots, and occasional white spots on the darker surface. The interior of the aperture is rosy pink. [3] This species occurs in the Eastern Pacific along the Galapagos Islands, and the Sea of Cortez to Panama. Type locality: Islas Marias, Golfo de California.[4]  Conus dalli Stearns, 1873 Conus dalli Stearns, 1873 Conus dalli Stearns, 1873
