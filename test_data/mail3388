In the taxonomy of microorganisms, the Euryarchaeota (Greek for "broad old quality") are a phylum of the Archaea.[1][2][3] The Euryarchaeota include the methanogens, which produce methane and are often found in intestines, the halobacteria, which survive extreme concentrations of salt, and some extremely thermophilic aerobes and anaerobes. They are separated from the other archaeans based mainly on rRNA sequences. The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) [4] and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)[5] and the phylogeny is based on 16S rRNA-based LTP release 106 by 'The All-Species Living Tree' Project [6] ?Aciduliprofundum boonei  Reysenbach et al. 2006 ?'Candidatus Micrarchaeum acidiphilum' Baker et al. 2010 ?'Candidatus Parvarchaeum acidiphilum' Baker et al. 2010 ?Nanohaloarchaea  Methanopyrus Thermoplasmatales Thermococcaceae Archaeoglobaceae Methanococcales Methanobacteriales Methanomicrobia Halobacteriaceae Notes:  Strain found at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) but not listed in the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN)
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
