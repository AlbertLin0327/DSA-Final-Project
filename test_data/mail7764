Teresa King (born 1962, Clinton, North Carolina) is a Sergeant Major in the United States Army. She was the first female Commandant of the United States Army Drill Sergeant School at Fort Jackson, South Carolina.[1] King was born in Clinton, North Carolina,[2] the eighth of twelve children. Her father was a sharecropper who grew cucumbers and tobacco. King enlisted in the United States Army in 1980 and went to Basic Combat Training and Advanced Individual Training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. After training, King's first assignment was as a postal clerk in the 139th Postal Company located in Stuttgart, Germany. She volunteered for two years of drill sergeant duty and graduated from the United States Army Drill Sergeant School. [3] She was later assigned to 5th Battalion, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, at Fort Dix, New Jersey. She earned a "Drill Sergeant of the Cycle" award during her tour, after which she served as the battalion's personnel administration center (PAC) supervisor.[4] In 1987, King served as the administrative assistant to the Chief of Staff of the United States Army at the Pentagon. In 1988, she became the administrative assistant to the Director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, or DSCA (formerly the Defense Security Assistance Agency, or DSAA), Office of the Secretary of Defense, also at the Pentagon. In 1991, King was assigned as aid to the Senior Enlisted Advisor of the Director of the DSCA, Office of the Secretary of Defense. She served there until 1993. King left the Pentagon and was assigned to 18th Personnel Service Battalion at Fort Bragg, North Carolina until 1996. King then served as the First Sergeant for 19th Adjutant General Company (Postal) at Camp Casey, South Korea until 1997. In 1997, King became the first female First Sergeant for Headquarters and Headquarters Company, XVIII Airborne Corps, the largest company on Fort Bragg. King held that assignment until 2001. In 2005, King was assigned as the battalion Command Sergeant Major of the Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) battalion, United States Army, NATO for two years. In 2007, she was assigned as the Command Sergeant Major of 369th Adjutant General Battalion in Fort Jackson, South Carolina for another two years. In 2009, King was appointed as Commandant of the Drill Sergeant School. She served as Commandant until mid-2012, when she was relieved of duty. She is currently serving in a non-command billet, thus losing the "Command" title in front of her rank and returning her to regular Sergeant Major status. King's over 30 years of service has been during US military conflicts in Grenada, Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm in Iraq, Haiti, Panama, Somalia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq, but unlike many female soldiers, she has not deployed to a combat zone.[5][6] In December 2011, King was suspended from her duties as the Drill Sergeant School Commandant pending investigation. King hired legal council and sued the Army for reinstatement, claiming her suspension was due to racism and sexism. In May 2012, King was reinstated as Commandant at the Drill Sergeant School and relieved of duty approximately two weeks later. The Army stated that it was determined to be "in the best interests of the Drill Sergeant School that she relinquish her duties as Commandant." They also stated that her relief of duty "reflect(ed) a normal tour length and was based on the arrival of the (new) Commandant." Sources have claimed that the investigation against King is due to allegations of alcohol problems, having an improper sexual relationship with a subordinate, and possible unwarranted consideration for promotion based on claiming college credit from unaccredited post-secondary institutions[7], but the investigation against her is still pending[8]. King's nickname is "No Slack." She has stated that women should be allowed into combat units if they meet the same physical training standards as men.[9][10] King is divorced with no children. She has an online Masters degree in Business Management from Almeda College and a Doctor of Divinity from the American Institute of Holistic Theology, both unaccredited diploma mills. She also has an Associate's degree in General Studies from Northern Virginia Community College.
