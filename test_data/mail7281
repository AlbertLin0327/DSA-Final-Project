Content:
Leotiomyceta represents all the filamentous ascomycete fungi (Pezizomycotina), excluding the classes Pezizomycetes and Orbiliomycetes. It is well supported in several studies comparing DNA sequences in fungi[1][2]. It has originally been proposed as a superclass[3] but more recently was proposed as a rankless taxon for any well supported group above class (together with saccharomyceta, dothideomyceta and sordariomyceta[4]). Rankless taxa do not strictly follow the rules for taxonomic classifications in plants and fungi (ICBN) and therefore these names are informal, although they appear to reflect natural groups.
