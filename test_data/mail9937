In obstetrics, the term flexion point refers to a spot on the fetal head on which the cup of a ventouse should to be placed for extraction of the child to be most effective. When the cup of the ventouse is applied on the flexion point, the fetal head will remain flexed under traction, hence the name "flexion point". The flexion point is located on the sagittal suture, 3cm (about 1inch) forward of the posterior fontanelle.[1]
