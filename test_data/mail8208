Kris Kuksi is an American artist in the genre of Fantastic Realism.[1] Specializing in creating complex artistic installations, his work has been described as a study in timelessness and intricacies, reminiscent of lost civilizations, deities and ruins  perfectly preserved.[2] Kuksis work has been displayed at more than 100 exhibitions worldwide, including satellite art fairs of Art Basel, Pulse (Los Angeles and Miami) and Scope (Basel and Miami),[3] Liste Kln during the Cologne Art Fair in Germany and the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in the juried show The Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition Exhibition.[4] He has also been featured on the front covers of Philosophie[5] and Bl!sss Magazine,[6] and his work is owned by collectors ranging from film director Guillermo del Toro[7] to the Ellis County Bar Association in Kansas.[8] Born on March 2, 1973, in Springfield Missouri, Kris Kuksi grew up in neighboring Kansas. He spent his youth in a rural setting along with a blue-collar, working mother, two significantly older brothers and an absent father. In the absence of external distractions, Kuksi combined childhood toys including lego, spaceships and castles, and with materials such as bricks from a dilapidated barn to create dioramas and landscapes.[9] A lack of stimulation, from either technology in the form of television or from social interaction with other people fostered Kuksis imagination, allowing it to develop and grow. The artists has described how, living in an isolated, rural part of Kansas, there was little external stimulation or distraction and he [drew and ran] amuck outside imagining worlds within my head.[10] Kuksi attained a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Studio Painting in 1998 from Fort Hays State University, Hays in Kansas. He then completed a seminar on Studio Painting at Santa Reparata International School of Art in Florence, Italy in 2001[11] and was subsequently awarded a Master of Fine Arts in Studio Painting from Fort Hays State University in 2002.[12] Kuksi has also completed seminars in Old Masters  New Visions in Austria and Germany, in 2002 and 2005 respectively.[11] Kuksis influences include the Baroque and Rococo periods. He has described how he feels more in belonging to the Old World and that his artwork is very much a reaction to the corrupt and demoralized fall of modern-day society  a place where new beginnings, new wars, new philosophies, and new endings exist.[13][14] In an interview, Kuksi named Bernini, Bosch and Bruegel as some of the artists he admired and was influenced by saying, Nothing beats landscapes of hell, twisted contorted figures, hedonism, and flowers sprouting from anuses.[15] At times, the artists work presents its audience with a jarring discomfiture of imagery, which hints at a disquieting future. A sense of loss features often, mirroring the loss felt at the death of a loved one or at the removal of civil liberties. Regarding the latter, Kuksi has warned of related dangers such as the rise of fundamentalism or dictatorship.[16] Also at issue, according to the artist, is the effect of people themselves on the Earths natural resources. Kuksi has described how the world is Overpopulated, losing precious resources, de-moralized, and polluted. If the Earth were a person she would be quite ill, infected with a sickness known as humanity.[17] Referring to religion, he has suggested that an attachment to the apocalyptic end times described in the biblical Book of Revelations may result in humanity causing such prophesies to become self-fulfilling.[18] Kuksi has said that humanity is doomed if they cant see the result of repeated historical rise and falls. Perhaps it is as simple as we just arent smart enough to save ourselves.[14] Kuksi cuts and reshapes old objects, small toys, mechanical components and other parts and refashions them into works of art that bear little resemblance to the original appearance. A wide range of materials are utilized, including model parts, wood and metal.[19] The artist describes these as mixed media that are melded by a flowing composition and visual balance.[20] Kuksis work often combines images in disconcerting ways, such as Churchtank which merges images of religion and warfare.[21] The artist collects material from around the world for the assemblages, with components coming from Ukraine, Singapore, Germany, Prague, Philippines, Lithuania, Japan and Singapore. Items are either bought in person or delivered to his studio in Hays, Kansas.[22] One reviewer has described Kuksis assemblages as a confusing amalgam. Hanging on a thread of being classical and solemn,  rococoish and ornate.[14] These creations have become some of the artists most high-profile work and in interview he has commented that these appear to have an appeal for viewers and collectors, perhaps because of their three dimensional aspect and because they are like small worlds that you can spend a long time exploring.[23] Others have described the experience as if he put you on an uncomfortable armchair, widened your eyes with a brutal and cold machine and forced you to watch these seemingly far away realities, through the lens of our voyeurism.[24] Kuksi has studied with established artists in Italy, Austria and Spain, including participating in several international workshops including Painting the Fantastic with Robert Venosa in Italy, Old Masters New Visions Seminar with Philip Rubinov Jacobson in Austria and Painting Dalis Garden, with Venosa in Spain.[25] The artists paintings combine discordant elements and suggest an affinity with the macabre and enigmatic,[26] as images are enmeshed in successive layers of incongruous and bizarre subjects.[26] His paintings and drawings have been described as reminiscent of old masters in their depiction of anatomical creation.[26] In addition, they have been critiqued as incorporating elements of surrealism and displaying hallucinatory patterns and shapes deep within the delirium of paranoia and obsessive behaviours.[27] According to critics, Kuksis paintings are either so realistic they could be photos or psychedelic, almost esoteric[14] Kuksis work has been described as mind-blowing, macabre, and beautifully grotesque art[that] will taunt you by the sheer complexity of detail, leaving you even more baffled as you stare for hours at all the figurines that were smacked into coexistence.[20] The end result has been described as intricately polarized narratives of the balance between good and evil, left and right, night and day, past and future.[28] Kuksi has featured in more than 100 exhibitions worldwide, including Art Basel, Miami, Berlin, the Cologne Art Fair in Germany and the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery.[11] He has won a number of awards including the Award of Merit from Williamsburg Art and Historical Center, and the First Place Award from Direct Art Magazine.[29] Additionally, Kuksi has been featured in books on sculpture and modern art, such as Device Volume II: Reconstructed, [30] and Spider Pie. [27] Kuksi's work can also been found on the front covers of Philosophie[31] and Bl!sss Magazine.[32] He has sold works of art at auction through Sothebys.[27] Collectors of Kuksi pieces include Kay Alden (five time Emmy award winning writer for The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful), actor Robin Williams (Academy Award and Golden Globe winning actor), musician and director Fred Durst, director Chris Weitz (The Golden Compass and Twilight: New Moon), director Guillermo del Toro (Pans Labyrinth & Hell Boy 2), Nike CEO, Mark Parker and the Ellis County Bar Association in Kansas.[33][34][35][36][37] Publisher: Last Gasp of San Francisco ISBN 0-9803231-3-4; ISBN 978-0-9803231-3-9 Kris Kuksi is married with two young children.
