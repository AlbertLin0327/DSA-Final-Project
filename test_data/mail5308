The hegelung is a wooden 2-stringed lute played by the Tboli, an animist ethnolinguistic group of southern Mindanao in the Philippines. The instrument is tall and slender, with nine frets. One string is used as a drone, and the other for melodic ornamentation.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
