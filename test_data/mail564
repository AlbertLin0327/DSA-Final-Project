Luke Thomas Hyam (born 24 October 1991 in Ipswich) is an English professional footballer who plays for Ipswich Town in the Football League Championship. Hyam came through the academy at Ipswich Town, having joined the club when he was a pupil at Northgate High School in the town. Having progressed though the ranks of the youth academy, Hyam was a regular member of the reserve team in 20092010. Hyam made regular appearances during the preseason of the 201011 season, notably against both West Ham United and PSV Eindhoven.[2] He was handed his first team debut by manager Roy Keane in the 31 opening day win away at Middlesbrough on 7 August 2010. Following the sacking of Keane in January 2011, Paul Jewell was appointed as the new manager of Ipswich. It appeared very early on that Hyam would not get as much of a chance to play under Jewell as he did during Keane's time in charge, and was subsequently cast aside for the rest of the season. In April 2011, however, he was awarded a twelve month contract extension by the club, indicating that Jewell was not yet giving up on him.[3] At the start of the 2011-12 season, Hyam again found his chances limited, despite having made a handful of appearances in pre-season. His first competitive appearance under Jewell came in the first round of the league cup, as Ipswich found themselves the victims of one of the round's biggest upsets, losing 2-1 to Northampton. He had to wait until January 2012 before he would finally be given a start in the league under Jewell. Having faced the wrath of the fans for not including enough of the club's young players, Jewell included Hyam in a very young starting XI for the game against Blackpool, with an average age of just under 25.[4] During the game Hyam was one of the star performers, earning praise from one of the senior players in the line-up, Andy Drury. He said: Andy Drury, [5]
