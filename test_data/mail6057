The Filzen Saddle (German: Filzensattel) is a mountain pass, 1,291mAA high, between Saalfelden am Steinernen Meer near Hinterthal/Maria Alm in the Pinzgau region and Dienten am Hochknig in the Pongau in the Austrian federal state of Salzburg. The B164 crosses the saddle linking Saalfelden via the Dienten Saddle and Bischofshofen.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
