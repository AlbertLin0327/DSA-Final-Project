Second Screen is a term that refers to an additional electronic device (e.g. tablet, smartphone) that allows a television audience to interact with the content they are consuming. The shift that occurs when you let go of traditional TV, social television creates a need for interaction between the sender and content consumers. This new requirement involves new services, applications and changes in content production. An important part of this new requirement is satisfied by the use of "second screen" because it provides the user with a way that does not interrupt playback directly to the content, but provides a parallel path, whereby the user can become an active agent in the broadcast content or just some other activity. Several studies show a clear tendency of the user to use a device while watching television. They also show a greater frequency of use of tablet or smartphone when you're watching television, a fact that Other studies exposed to distinguish a higher percentage of comments or posts on social networks, about the content that's being watched (Nielsen ratings) [1][2][3] On these studies, many companies both in content production, advertising and have adapted their formats to the user trying to get maximum attention and therefore more profitable. Applications are becoming a natural extension of television programming, both live and on demand. Many applications in the "second screen" are designed to give you another way of interactivity to the user and also another way to sell advertising content. Some examples: [12] In sports, Broadcasters, to avoid the flight of the TV audience which are watching the main screen (new name for the television) for the second screen, are all offering alternative content to the main program. The idea is to propose content related to the main program, such as unseen moments, alternative information, soundtrack, and characters. Proposed new technology allow the viewer to see different camera angles while watching the game.[13][14] In Denmark - TV2 (Denmarks largest commercial TV channel) did a Second Screen service with technology provider www.itvblue.com to synchronize events live as the Giro d'Italia 2012 bicycling event took place from May 5th to May 27th 2012, where viewers on all internet devices could get rider stats, biographies, news, stage reviews, city info, weather info and much more. Viewers scanned a QR code on the TV broadcast to get connected, or typed in a short URL.[citation needed] Multiseat configuration Wii U A gaming console that has a screen in the controller, with a TV
