Misys plc (LSE:MSY) is a British multinational software company headquartered in London. It specialises in software for banking and investment businesses. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. The company was founded in 1979 as a computer systems supplier to UK insurance brokers.[3] By purchasing multiple established players in respective markets Misys evolved at various times into a software supplier to the US healthcare industry, banks (world wide) and funds managers. Several of the companies acquired by Misys were themselves products of previous mergers. In 1987 Misys shares were first traded on the Unlisted Securities Market. It was admitted to the Main List of the London Stock Exchange in 1989, leveraged on the initial successes of purchases. The biggest company to be brought into the Misys fold was BIS. Business Intelligence Systems or BIS Ltd in 1976 acquired Kingsley-Smith and Associates and a software package named MIDAS. This banking software system was based on a concept of a core multi-currency accounting module. At the time most other International Banks worldwide worked and accounted on a 'single currency' methodology. It was marketed to and operated successfully by a number of client London Banks from 1979. From the mid to late-1980s competition to MIDAS came from vendors with systems called Kapiti, BankMaster (from Kindle) and IBIS. In 1991 ACT purchased Kindle followed by BIS in 1993 uniting 2 of the biggest selling products under one ownership albeit with different user bases. Midas was still focused on its traditional strength of international branch banking in the world's financial centers. The simplicity of Bankmaster and its Branchpower front end sold very well to tier 3 and 4 banks in Africa and south America. Kapiti ltd like KSA was a privatively held packaged banking software house focused on using IBM's mid range computers to server the international branch banking market. Kapiti was founded in 1975 by a Mr. John Kennedy, a New Zealand native and competed directly with the commercially more successful Midas system. Initially head quartered in London the company moved to Windsor then Slough, Berkshire. Kapiti re-branded with some success the Kapiti International Banking System (KIBS) as EQUATION 1. The combination of the port to the new IBM AS/400 platform with its increased scalability, the user friendly EQ2 user interface rework, the EQ3 data base rewrite and the addition of a client server Cashier system had allowed an expansion into retail banking. Kapiti also pursued wholesale banking by merging with Aragon international, purchasing Future Systems and building in house a trade finance system called Trade Innovation. In 1994 Misys entered the banking software space by purchasing Kapiti. In 1995 Misys purchased ACT, thus rapidly giving Misys control of 3 of the 4 biggest selling banking packages at the time. At time of purchase Midas had the biggest installed base of any "off-the shelf" banking software package. In 1996 it bought Summit Systems, an American software company selling a front-office cross-asset management system targeting investment banks' trading rooms. In 1997 it bought Medic Computer Systems, a healthcare software business.[4] In 2001 it went on to buy DBS Management plc, a supplier of software to Independent Financial Advisors.[5] It also bought Sunquest Information Systems Inc., a US supplier of clinical systems software [6] and later sold the same in 2007.[7] In 2004 the company bought IQ Financial Systems from Deutsche Bank for 20m.[8] In 2007 newly appointed CEO Mike Lawrie set out a new three- to five-year strategy to turn around and improve the financial operating performance of the company.[9] In 2008 the company announced a merger between its healthcare business and Allscripts, a medical records business. The merger was completed on 10 October 2008, and Misys plc now holds a majority shareholding in the merged entity known as Allscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions, Inc, which is listed on the NASDAQ (MDRX).[10] In June 2010, Allscripts announced a merger with Eclipsys Corporation, and that the Misys stake in Allscripts was to be reduced through a share buyback and secondary offering.[11] On 12 November 2010, Misys announced that is had reached an agreement to acquire Sophis, a leading provider of portfolio and risk management software.[12] Misys entered into merger talks with its Swiss rival Temenos in February 2012.[13] The deal later collapsed when the two sides were unable to agree terms. On March 19, 2012 private equity firm Vista Equity Partners announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Misys for 350p per share, valuing the company at 1.27bn.[14] Misys is organised into the following four divisions:[15] Misys Banking is the specialist banking solutions business within Misys plc with a customer base across retail banking, corporate and wholesale banking. Misys Treasury & Capital Markets (TCM) creates integrated solutions for financial institutions to manage their capital market activities across multiple asset classes.
