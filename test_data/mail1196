Newtonferry (Scottish Gaelic: Port nan Long: "the harbour of the ships"[1]) is a small crofting community on the island of North Uist in the Western Isles of Scotland, at the end of the B893 road. A number of archaeological sites have been discovered in the vicinity.[2] [3] A ferry used to run between Newtonferry and the neighboring island of Berneray, but no longer runs since a permanent causeway was constructed between Berneray and North Uist.[4] Coordinates: 574112N 71244W / 57.6867N 7.2122W / 57.6867; -7.2122
