Operation Blessing International Relief and Development Corporation (OBI) is a non-profit 501(c)(3) non-profit humanitarian organization based in Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA and has an operation named Operation Blessing Foundation Philippines, Inc. Since 1978, Operation Blessing International has provided hunger relief, disaster relief, medical aid and community development to more than 192.8 million people in 96 countries and all 50 US states, providing goods and services valued at more than $1.2 billion. Operation Blessing is governed by a national board of directors that includes founder M. G. "Pat" Robertson, his wife, and son Gordon.[1] Founded on November 14, 1978 by businessman, televangelist, and philanthropist Pat Robertson, Operation Blessing was originally set up to help struggling individuals and families by matching their needs for items such as clothing, appliances, and vehicles with donated items from viewers of The 700 Club, Robertson's daily television program. Over the years, Operation Blessing connected with local churches and other organisations and was able to fund those families with little money. According to the organization's official website, Operation Blessing's mission statement is "...to demonstrate God's love by alleviating human need and suffering in the United States and around the world."[2] Specializing in disaster relief, Operation Blessing was a first responder during the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, which included Hurricane Charley,[3] Hurricane Frances, Hurricane Ivan, and Hurricane Jeanne.[4] The organization was involved in relief work following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand,[5] as well as ongoing recovery efforts in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina.[6][7][8] More recently, OBI has funded relief and recovery efforts in response to the Darfur conflict;[9] war-torn Somalia,[10] Israel and Lebanon;[11] the 2005-2006 Niger food crisis;[12] and flooding, mudslides and earthquakes in regions of Indonesia,[13] Mozambique[14] and the Philippines.[15] OBI operates a variety of domestic and international medical programs,[16] including a response to the post-Hurricane Katrina medical crisis in New Orleans.[17] The organization recently launched a program called Join the Net to help combat the spread of malaria by mosquitoes in the developing world.[18] In 2007 The NonProfitTimes selected Operation Blessing President Bill Horan for inclusion on their annual list titled "Power & Influence Top 50."[19] Operation Blessing is a member of the Association of Evangelical Relief and Development Organizations (AERDO)[20] and Christian Service Charities[21] and is registered with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)[22] and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).[23] OBI is also a national member of the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (NVOAD).[24] Operation Blessing has partnered with a number of private organizations, including professional sports teams the Kansas City Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals.[25] Operation Blessing airplanes were reportedly[26] being used for Pat Robertson's personal mining venture. In 1997, two of Operation Blessing's pilots, Robert Hinkle and Tahir Brohi, told the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot newspaper that Operation Blessing planes were diverted to support Pat Robertson's diamond mining ventures instead of doing relief work in Zaire. At the time, Robertson had become a close friend of Zaire's dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko and had tried to lift the ban on Mobutu's visa to the US. An investigation by the Virginia Attorney General's office concluded that Operation Blessing "willfully induced contributions from the public through the use of misleading statements..." Robertson reimbursed US$400,000 to the charity and agreed to tighten its bookkeeping.[27] According to the organization, over 99.3% of OBIs spending goes toward humanitarian programs.[1] Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network is the largest single beneficiary of the organization.[27]
