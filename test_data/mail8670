In LaVeyan Satanism there are two main types of Magic, Greater Magic and Lesser Magic. Greater Magic involves ritual and ceremony to focus one's emotional energy for a specific purpose. Lesser Magic consists of non-ritual or manipulative magic, through use of natural abilities to manipulate other humans, and therefore circumstances, by wile and guile. At the forefront of this effort, according to Anton LaVey, is knowledge of how to employ appearances to one's advantage. LaVey states that Lesser Magic can be divided into three subsections based on the type of spell desired; Sex (or lust), Compassion or Destruction, and that proper mastery of lesser magic involves finding which of the three naturally compliments your personality and appearance.[1] He states that a person can employ contrived appearance to gain the alliance or obedience of others, and a competent magician can even combine these aesthetics as necessary. LaVey also states that a magician's actions to manipulate are an important component of Lesser Magic. LaVey later treated the matter of Lesser Magic in considerable detail in his book The Satanic Witch.
