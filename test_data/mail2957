Katanga is one of the provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Between 1971 and 1997 (during the rule of Mobutu Sese Seko when Congo was known as Zaire), its official name was Shaba Province. Katanga's regional capital is Lubumbashi. Its area is 497,000km, larger than California and 16 times larger than Belgium. Farming and ranching are carried out on the Katanga Plateau. The eastern part of the province is a rich mining region, which supplies cobalt, copper, tin, radium, uranium, and diamonds. The capital city, Lubumbashi, is the second largest city in the Congo. Mose Katumbi Chapwe, a businessman, is the governor of Katanga province. He took office on 24 February 2007.[1] Copper mining is an important part of the economy of Katanga province.[2] Cobalt mining by individual contractors is also prevalent. There are a number of reasons cited for the discrepancy between the vast mineral wealth of the province and the failure of the wealth to increase the overall standard of living.[3] Gcamines is the state owned mining company which has monopoly concessions in the province. The province forms the Congolese border with Angola and Zambia. The province also borders Tanzania, although Katanga province and Tanzania do not share a land border but the border is within Lake Tanganyika. Katanga has a wet and dry season. Rainfall is about 49inches per year (120cm).[4] The University of Lubumbashi is the largest university in the province and one of the largest in the country.

TESOL, the English Language School of Lubumbashi, is a secondary school that serves the expatriate community. It was founded in 1987 on the grounds of the now defunct French School.[5] The Jason Sendwe Hospital is the largest hospital in the province, located in Lubumbashi. Katanga province has the highest rate of infant mortality in the world, with 184 of 1000 babies born expected to die before the age of five. [6] Katanga Province has limited railway service centered around Lubumbashi. Reliability is limited. The area also has an airport called Luano Airport which is located northeast of Lubumbashi. Katanga province is served by television broadcasts. Radio-Tlvision Nationale Congolaise (RTNC) has a transmitter in Lubumbashi that re-transmits the signal from Kinshasa.
