According to the Summer Institute for Linguistics's guide to world languages, the Ethnologue, the Romance languages include 47 languages and dialects spoken in Europe. This language group is a part of the Italic languages family, with Latin being the only extant Italic non-Romanic language. The classification described below is largely based on the analysis provided by the Ethnologue. The ISO-639-2 code roa is applied by the ISO for any Romance variety that does not have its own code. The Ethnologue classification is regarded[who?] to be at one extreme of points of view held by linguists, who are roughly divided into 'splitters' (like the Ethnologue) and 'lumpers'. The Ethnologue classification produces a very detailed classification, more reflectant of regional difference than many other linguists would accept, but valuable as a description of varieties. Top level groups are listed roughly East to West. This article lists also the main groups of Romance-based creole languages. Western Romance languages comprise the Romance subgroup with the most languages and the most speakers. It includes the three major international languages of French, Portuguese, and Spanish as well as many regional languages, dialects, and varieties. The languages in this subfamily can be grouped into four main groups: Gallo-Rhaetian, GalloItalic, Occitano Romance, and Iberian Romance. But there is no consensus on how these four groups relate. The Ethnologue groups the first two under Gallo-Romance (and generally lists Gallo-Italic first and Gallo-Rhaetian second), and considers Occitano Romance a subgroup of Iberian Romance. Sometimes, however, Occitano Romance is regarded as a group of its own. Yet another method is to lump Northern Italian and Occitano Romance as subgroups of a group of their own.[citation needed] For simplicity of presentation, the four groups are listed separately below. However, note that all points of view among linguists reject a classification into four groups.[citation needed] There is a controversy about the classification of Catalan and Occitan languages. One way is to list them as a distinct group of its own. A second way is to lump them into the Ibero-Romance group, under the claim that they serve as transitional languages between Ibero-Romance and Gallo-Romance. A third way is to lump it with the Gallo-Italic subclad of the Gallo-Romance.[citation needed] This group includes the West Iberian languages - Asturian, Leonese, Mirandese, Spanish, Galician, Portuguese and their dialects. The global spread of colonial Romance languages has given rise to numerous creole languages and pidgins. Some of the lesser-used languages have also had influences on varieties spoken far from their traditional regions. The following is a partial list of creole languages and pidgins, grouped by their main source language. While not being pidgins nor creoles, English (see Middle English creole hypothesis), Basque and Albanian have a substantial Romance influence in their vocabularies. For mixed languages based on Romance languages, see the main article on Mixed languages. The 47 spoken varieties identified by the Ethnologue can be grouped by usage as follows: The Ethnologue classification does not include numerous other dialects and varieties of the Romance languages, such as:
