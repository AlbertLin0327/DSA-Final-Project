Sir Thomas Russell Albert Mason Cook (12 June 1902  12 August 1970) was a Conservative Party politician in the United Kingdom. He served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1931 to 1945. At the 1924 general election, he was an unsuccessful candidate in the Labour held constituency of North Norfolk. He was defeated again by Labour's Noel Buxton at the 1929 general election, and at the by-election in 1930 when Lady Noel-Buxton held the seat with a majority of only 139 votes after her husband's elevation to the peerage. At the 1931 general election, Cook won the seat from Lady Noel-Buxton with a majority of nearly 7,000. He was re-elected at the 1935 election. He was knighted in 1937. In the Labour landslide at the 1945 general election, he was ousted by Labour's Edwin Gooch. Thomas Cook was a member of the Royal Norfolk Agricultural Association and served on the Norfolk County Council. From 1930 to 1955 he ran the Norfolk Chronicle. He was county commissioner for the Norfolk St John Ambulance Brigade and Master of the Glaziers' Company in London.
