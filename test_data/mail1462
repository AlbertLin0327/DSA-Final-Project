Senecio clivorum Maxim. Erythrochaete dentata A. Gray Ligularia clivorum Maxim. Source: NRCS,[1] BMG[2] Ligularia dentata, or summer ragwort and leopard plant, is a species of the genus Ligularia and the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial native to China and Japan. The plant is a clump-forming perennial. The dark green leaves are large, long-stalked, leathery, cordate-based, and very rounded. Orange-yellow daisy-like flowers bloom on thick mostly leafless stalks, rising above the foliage in early summer. Ligularia dentata contains tumorigenic pyrrolizidine alkaloids.[3]  Ligularia dentata is grown as an ornamental plant, chosen as much for its bold foliage as its flowers. [4] It is used as a round leaved accent plant or massed planting in moist sun and partial shade garden settings, and in containers. Cultivars include "Desdemona" and "Othello". Selections with cream color spotted foliage (polka dots) are also grown.
