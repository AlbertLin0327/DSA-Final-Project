West Azerbaijan Province or West Azarbaijan Province (Persian:   , Ostn-e zarbijn-e Gharb ), is one of the 31 provinces of Iran. It is located in the North West of the country, bordering Turkey, Iraq and Nakhchivan, and the provinces of East Azerbaijan, Zanjan and Kurdistan. The province of West Azerbaijan covers an area of 39,487km, or 43,660km including Lake Urmia. In 2006 the province had a population of 3,015,361 [2]. The capital city and largest city of the province is Urmia. Permanent settlements were established in the province as early as the 6th millennium BC as excavation at sites such as Teppe Hasanlu establish. In Hasanlu, a famous Golden Vase was found in 1958. The province is also the location of Tepe Hajji Firuz, site of some of the world's earliest evidence of wine production.[8][9] Gooy Teppe is another significant site, where a metal plaque dating from 800 BC was found that depicts a scene from the epic of Gilgamesh. Ruins such as these and the UNESCO world heritage site at the Sassanid compound of Takht-i-Suleiman illustrate the strategic importance and tumultuous history of the province through the millennia. Overall, the province enjoys a wealth of historical attractions, with 169 sites registered by the Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran. The major known ancient civilization in the region was that of Mannaeans, a buffer state between Urartian and Assyrian sphere of influence. Mannaeans in turn spoke a language related to Urartian. After the fall of Assyria, the region was known as Mantiene (or Matiene) in Greek sources. Matiene bordered on Atropatene situated east of Lake Urmia. The region subsequently was known as Persarmenia from the second century BC. as late as 11th century AD. In the late 4th century AD Sassanids incorporated the area into the neighbouring Adhurpadaghan satrapy to the east[10]. The name Adhurpatagan, later Arabicized to Azarbaijan, derives from Atropates,[11][12] an Iranian satrap of Media under the Achaemenid empire, who later was reinstated as the satrap of Media under Alexander of Macedonia.[13] Around the 10th century when the region of Persarmnia was under rule of Hadhabani Kurds, the medieval geographer Al-Muqaddasi described the area of what is today called West Azarbaijan province as part of Armenia[14]: Azarbaijan: Its capital and metropolis of the region is Ardabil. Among its towns are: Rasba, Tabriz, Jabirwan, Khunaj, Al-Miyanj, Al-Sarat, Barwa, Warthan, Muqan, Mimadh, Barzand. The battle of DimDim between Safavids and Kurds took place in this region. After a long and bloody siege led by the Safavid grand vizier Hatem Beg, which lasted from November 1609 to the summer of 1610, the Castle of Dimdim was captured. All the defenders were killed and Shah Abbas I ordered a general massacre in Bradost and Mukriyan (reported by Eskandar Beg, Safavid Historian in the Book Alam Aray-e Abbasi) and resettled the Turkish Afshar tribe in the region while deporting many Kurdish tribes to Khorasan region. The Persarmneian districts of Mk (Artaz), oy (Her), Salms (Zarewand), and Arasbrn (Parspatunik), and the region of Urmia (Parskahayk), according to 19th century administrative division became a part of the northwestern Iranian province of Azarbaijan [15] In 1937 the province was renamed to Shomal-e gharb (i.e. northwestern province). Shortly after the province was divided into a western and eastern part which were renamed to Chaharom (Fourth province) and sevom (Third province), respectively. In 1961 Fourth province was renamed West Azarbaijan by the Iranian authoroties. These separatist movements may have many motivations and origins; however, the colonialist policies of the Soviet Union and Imperial Russia encouraged such movements. In a cable sent on July 6, 1945 by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the local Soviet commander in Russian held Azerbaijan (northern Azerbaijan) was instructed: With an area of 43,660 square kilometers, including Lake Urmia, the province of West Azerbaijan is located on the north-west of Iran. The climate of the province is largely influenced by the rainy winds of the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean. Cold northern winds affect the province during winter and cause heavy snow. According to existing meteorological data, local temperatures vary within the province. Average temperature differs from 9.4 C in Piranshahr to 11.6 C in Mahabad, while it is 9.8 C in Urmia, 10.8 C in Khoy, 9.4 C in Piranshahr, and in Mahabad 11.6 C. According to same data, the highest temperature in the province reaches 34 C in July, and the lowest temperature is 16 C in January. Maximum change of temperature in summer is 4 C, and in winter 15 C. Average annual precipitation ranges from 870 millimetres (34in) of rainfall equivalent in exposed southern areas down to around 300 millimetres (12in) in Maku in the north,[19] of which a substantial proportion is snow. West Azerbayjan province, encompassing vast and fertile plains, high mountains, enjoying moderate and healthy weather, rivers with high volume of water, vineyards, orchards, luxuriant forest and rangelands, mountain outskirt with wonderful flora, magnificent wildlife and beautiful shores around the lake with different recreational facilities, which all together form one of the most beautiful and spectacular region in Iran. A land with wonderful flora during the spring and the summer covered with tulip, poppy, narcissus and hyacinth extending from Arass rivers banks in the north to Zab Kouchak valley in the south. The province is divided into 14 shahrestans (counties). The present number of shahrestans (counties) was achieved over time by subdivision of many of the larger shahrestans into smaller ones. The current cities by population are: Urmia, Khoy, Bukan, Mahabad, Piranshahr, Miandoab, Oshnaviyeh, Salmas, Naghadeh, Takab, Shahindej, Maku, Chaldoran County, Sardasht. There are no official statistics or census figures on the ethnic makeup of Iran. The bulk of the population in West Azerbaijan Province are mainly Azerbaijanis[1][2] and Kurds.[5] There are three ethnic and religious groups who are native to the province but who have minority status: Assyrians, Armenians, and Jews. There are also immigrants from other parts of Iran in the major cities of the province. Azerbaijanis are living in Chaldoran, Maku, Khoy, Salmas, Urmia, Naghadeh and Miandoab counties. Kurds are living in Oshnaviyeh, Sardasht, Mahabad, Piranshahr and Bukan counties. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] Most of West Azarbaijan is inhabitted by the Kurds[25], who form a large portion of the population[26] and it constitutes part of the Iranian Kurdistan[27]. The diversity of religions in the province has been a major factor throughout the entire history of the province. The religions in the province are: Shia and Sunni Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and Yarasani. Both Azeris and Kurds follow Islam, the Kurds belonging mainly to the Sunni branch and the Azerbaijanis being Shias. There is also a very small minority who follow a religion called Yarasani (or Ahl-e Haqq,  ). Christianity is the only religion of the Assyrians, and Armenians. The Jews, as the name indicates, belong to the Jewish religion.There are also Bahais and Zoroastrians in the province. The fourteen counties and their people are listed as follows (based on 2006 estimations [28]): While some Muslim researchers[30] have proclaimed that the birth of the prophet Zoroaster was in this area, in the vicinity of Lake Orumieh, Chichesht or Ganzak; recent scholarship, however, indicates that sites in Central Asia are more likely.[31] In this province, Islam (Sunni and Shiite) is the majority religion. However, there is also a large Assyrians Christian minority, who have historically lived on the west shore of Lake Urmia, as well as Armenians who are scattered throughout the province. Notably, the city of Maku in northern West Azerbaijan was the only city in Iran (before World War II) where Christians comprised the majority. St. Thaddeus Cathedral is located on the outskirts of Chaldoran, near the village of Qara-Kelissa. Besides being a religious site with a particular significance among Christians, particularly Armenians, this large church (monastery) is also a rare and valuable monument in architectural and artistic terms. St. Thaddeus, also known as Jude Thaddeus or Jude Labbeus, was one of the apostles of Jesus Christ who traveled to Armenia, where he was later killed and upon whose grave the locals erected a small chapel in AD 301. The cathedral is known as Qara-kelissa ('Black church' in Turkish) to the locals, owing to the appearance of its western section. In 1329, the church was reconstructed in its present form after an earthquake destroyed the structure in 1319. In all, thirty-one churches are registered by the Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran in the province. Many of these are historical landmarks and unusually rich in heritage. Some of the more famous ones are listed as follows:[32] Armenian Churches Assyrian Churches In 2008, UNESCO selected a group of these religious structures as part of the Armenian Monastic Ensembles in Iran World Heritage Site.[33] The city of Urmia has a higher standard of living in comparison with the other cities of the province. There are plenty of parks, coffee shops, cinemas, and internet cafes throughout the city. There are hundreds of small villages in the province as well, most of which have running water and electricity as well as television, satellite, and telephone lines. Southern cities which economically are considered poor areas have always been the venue of Kurdish demonstrators against the Islamic regime. [5] West Azerbaijan Province is one of the most important provinces for Iran's agriculture. Iran's current Minister of Energy, Parviz Fattah is from Urmia. West Azerbaijan possesses a rich culture, stemming from Azeri and Kurdish traditions. Many local traditions, such as music and dance, continue to survive among the various peoples of the province. As a longstanding province of Persia, West Azerbaijan is mentioned favorably on many occasions in Persian literature by Iran's greatest authors and poets:            All the nobles and greats of Iran, Choose from Azarbaijan, Ray, and Gorgan. --Vis o Ramin        From there the wise and the free, set off to Azarbaijan --Nizami         For a month's time, The Kings and The Free, Would choose in Azarbaijan to be --Firdowsi Urmia University was first built by an American Presbyterian missionary in 1878. A medical faculty was also established there headed by Joseph Cochran and a team of American medical associates. Joseph Cochran and his colleagues were buried in an old cemetery in the vicinity of Urmia. Urmia University website says this about them: The province today has the following major institutes of higher education:
