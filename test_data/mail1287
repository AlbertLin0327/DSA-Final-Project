In Japan, high school baseball (: kk yaky) generally refers to the two annual baseball tournaments played by high schools nationwide culminating at a final showdown at Hanshin Kshien Stadium in Nishinomiya, Japan. They are organized by the Japan High School Baseball Federation in association with Mainichi Shimbun for the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring (also known as "Spring Kshien") and Asahi Shimbun for the National High School Baseball Championship in the summer (also known as "Summer Kshien"). These nationwide tournaments enjoy widespread popularity similar to that of NCAA March Madness in the United States, arguably equal to or greater than professional baseball. Qualifying tournaments are often televised locally and each game of the final stage at Kshien is televised nationally on NHK. The tournaments have become a national tradition, and large numbers of frenzied students and parents travel from hometowns to cheer for their local team. It is a common sight to see players walking off the field in tears after being eliminated from the tournament by a loss. The star players of the championship team achieve a degree of celebrity status. For the players, playing at Kshien is the door to playing at the professional level. Due to the recruiting practices of Japanese high schools, top prospects often play on strong teams that are able to reach the final tournament at Kshien. Several professional baseball players first made their mark at Kshien, including Eiji Band, Sadaharu Oh, Koji Ota, Suguru Egawa, Masumi Kuwata, Kazuhiro Kiyohara, Hideki Matsui, Daisuke Matsuzaka, Yu Darvish and Masahiro Tanaka. There are two main tournaments: In addition, there is a separate and less well-known Meiji Jingu Baseball Tournament held each year in November at Jingu Baseball Stadium in Tokyo. Since the 2002 tournament, the winner is guaranteed a spot in the following Spring tournament at Kshien. In addition, the region of the winning school receives one extra bid. In the week preceding the tournament in spring and summer, teams who have won a spot in the tournament each hold a 30 minute practice on the grounds of Hanshin Kshien Stadium. This is mainly to help the players adjust to the environment of the stadium. In the summer, due to scheduling conflicts with the Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball, the Tigers are forced to go on a three-week road trip every year during this period to allow the tournament to take place. In addition, teams are able to practice during the tournament at public and private facilities made available in Nishinomiya, and neighboring Osaka, Amagasaki, and Kobe. Usually, 1st year students cannot take part in Spring Kshien (only 2nd and 3rd year students), so in three years of high school there are five chances for a player to go to Kshien. In November 2004, in response to a growing trend among Japan's youths, the Baseball Federation announced that players could not participate with dyed-hair or shaved eyebrows. Known in Japanese as , haru-natsu renzoku yuusho or Spring-Summer Consecutive Champions, this signifies the winning of the senbatsu (Spring) and natsu (Summer) tournaments in a calendar year. To date there have been 6 instances of such a feat: Namish is now known as Daitaidai Namish. Before World War II, teams from Taiwan, Korea, and Manchuria, which were all part of the Japanese Empire at the time, participated in the tournaments (in the spring only Taiwan took part). The first overseas teams to participate were Pusan Commercial School of Korea and Dalian Commercial School of Manchuria in the 1921 Summer Kshien. Foreign teams have made it as far as the championship game, but have never won the tournament. The last tournament including foreign teams was the 1940 Spring Kshien. (Manchuria) Currently, the maximum number of times a player can appear in Kshien is five. However, under the old secondary school system, a player could appear more than five times. Here are two examples. The tournament was suspended due to the war from summer 1941 until spring 1946, with the exception of a "Promote the Fighting Spirit" tournament held by the Ministry of Education in 1942 at Kshien. The number of teams was only 16 compared with 23 at the previous tournament, but each region held qualifying tournaments and sent teams to a national tournament. The military theme was prevalent at the tournament, with military slogans posted on the scoreboard, and names on uniforms previously written in trendy Roman alphabet letters replaced by traditional Japanese kanji characters. The tournament proceeded smoothly and Tokushima Commercial (Tokushima) won the championship. However, since this tournament differed from past Summer Kshiens hosted by Asahi Shimbun it is not counted as an official Kshien tournament. In the 1937 Summer Kshien, Kumamoto Tech (Kumamoto) advanced to the championship game, but lost. After the game, Kumamoto Tech player Tetsuharu Kawakami grabbed a handful of dirt from the playing field of Kshien Stadium and put it in his uniform pocket as a memento. Some years later, in the 1949 Summer Kshien, after Kokura High (Fukuoka) lost to Kurashiki Tech (Okayama) in the semifinals, Kokura pitcher Kunio Fukushima scooped up some Kshien dirt and took it home. This has become known as the original scooping of "the dirt of Kshien" (, Kshien no tsuchi?). Since then, as a memento of their fleeting time on the hallowed grounds of Kshien, players from the losing teams take home a pouch of the precious soil. At the 1958 Summer Kshien, Shuri High (Okinawa) became the first school to represent Okinawa (then under U.S. government rule) in a Kshien tournament. They were eliminated in their first game by Tsuruga High (Fukui). After the game, they collected souvenirs of dirt and took them home. However, due to quarantine regulations of the Ryky government they were not allowed to keep the dirt, and it was confiscated. Some Japan Airlines flight attendants heard about this, and had a sea stone lying outside Kshien Stadium sent to Shuri. Even today this "Monument of Friendship" lies in the yard of the school as a reminder of the first trip to Kshien by a team from Okinawa. In the past, if a scandal was uncovered at a high school chosen to participate in the Kshien, the school was forced to withdraw from competition in the tournament. A team's participation in the tournament was affected even by scandals not related to team members. However, recently, such unrelated incidents have had less effect on a team's participation. Denials of Kshien participation based on circumstances other than scandals have also occurred. In the 1922 summer tournament, Niigata Commercial High School's denial was based on a star player's illness. This term is based on the barrier built in Shirakawa, Fukushima. No team north of the northern Kant region had ever won a tournament at Kshien. This fact became known in the high school baseball world as the "Shirakawa Barrier". At the 2004 Summer Kshien, Komazawa University Tomakomai High (southern Hokkaid) took the title, and in one bound leaped over not only the Shirakawa Barrier but also the Tsugaru Strait separating Hokkaido from Honsh. On the plane carrying the team and championship flag back home, at the moment the plane crossed the Tsugaru Strait, the passengers joined in unison for a celebration cheer. In 2005, Komazawa University Tomakomai High won a second straight Summer Kshien title, becoming the first to do so since Kokura Secondary (Fukuoka) in 194748. This title was tainted after the tournament, however, by reports of repeated incidents of physical punishment of one of the players, once during the tournament, by the baseball club advisor (a 27-year-old school faculty member). Besides a reprimand for withholding the report until after the tournament, the High School Baseball Federation did not punish Komazawa Tomakomai. However, the report drew widespread attention to the issue of physical punishment in youth sports in Japan. It is believed that such physical punishment probably goes heavily underreported, due to cultural tendencies. As mentioned above, Komawaza University Tomakomai (aka Komadai Tomakomai) won the 2004 Summer Koshien, becoming the northern-most school to win since Sakushin Gakuin (Tochigi). However, the route traveled by the championship flag from Koshien to Hokkaid did not actually pass through the Shirakawa Barrier by land, so many fans (especially in the Thoku region) believe that the barrier has technically not yet been broken. In high school baseball jargon, a championship by a school in the region from Kanagawa to Tochigi. During the Edo period, Shirakawa and Hakone were both strategic checkpoints and official passes were needed to pass through, thus leading to these names. The first team to "pass Hakone" was Keio Futsbu (Tky). After that, Shnan High (Kanagawa) won in summer of 1949. Despite the fact that Keio Futsbu won in summer of 1916, the victory by Shonan High in 1946 is known as the first "passing of Hakone". Reasons for this include the fact that 33 years had passed since the Keio Futsbu and Shonan High victories, the fact that western Japanese teams were seen as stronger than eastern Japanese teams at the time of Shonan High's victory, and the fact that high school baseball was not yet well known in 1916. The first spring passing of Hakone was achieved by Waseda Jitsugy (Tky) led by pitcher and future pro baseball legend Sadaharu Oh in 1957. Also, the "fording of the Tone River" in northern Kant has also been achieved. Since the victory of Waseda Jitsugy, championships by Kant teams have become more frequent and as a result these terms have fallen out of use. In high school baseball jargon, when a team from Kysh wins a tournament. The first to "cross the Kanmon Straits" was Kokura Secondary in the 1947 Summer Kshien. Coincidentally, Kokura Secondary repeated as champions in 1948, a feat not matched until Komadai Tomakomai also became the first team to bring the title to their region then repeated the following year. Based on Mount Aso in Kumamoto. In high school baseball jargon, when a team from the southern half of Kysh wins the tournament. The first to "pass the Mountain of Aso" was Seiseik High (Kumamoto) in the 1958 Spring Kshien. This is not been achieved in the Summer Kshien yet. In high school baseball jargon, when a team from Okinawa wins a tournament. The first to "cross the ocean" was Okinawa Shgaku (Okinawa) in the spring of 1999, and Konan (Okinawa) achieved the first summer championship in 2010. In high school baseball jargon, when a team from the Hokuriku region wins a tournament. To date no team has achieved this. Fukui Commercial High (Fukui) in the 1978 Spring Kshien and Seiry (Ishikawa, alma mater of Hideki Matsui) in the 1997 Summer Kshien reached the semifinals. More recently, Nihon Bunri (Niigata, Niigata) reached the finals in 2009, and made an amazing comeback from down 10-4 in the bottom of the 9th with 2 outs to make it 10-9 before catcher Naoki Wakabayashi lined out to 3rd to end the game. Some of the most famous appearances of high school baseball in popular culture are in the manga and anime series Touch, H2 and Cross Game by Mitsuru Adachi, and Major by Takuya Mitsuda. Those series follow the struggles of different high school teams' bids to make it to the Kshien tournament. An unusual appearance is in the series Princess Nine, where a private girls' high school forms a baseball team and struggles against systemic bias in the Japan High School Baseball Federation and within their own school in order to make a serious bid at making it to and winning at Kshien. Something similar, in the long running baseball video game series Pawapuro Series, it is known that at least three female players (two pitchers and one catcher, until 14) made their name in Kshien in the main series' original storyline (Success Mode) and turned active players in the NPB, through one of them retired later and become a coach and lecturer in Baseball academy. The manga and anime Big Windup! by Asa Higuchi is about high school baseball. It follows the story of a first-year pitcher and his team's struggles to get to Kshien. It won the Kodansha Manga Award in 2007. In the finale of the anime Zipang, radio broadcast of the "patriotic" 1942 summer tournament is playing in the background when Kadomatsu meets his grandfather back in the past.
