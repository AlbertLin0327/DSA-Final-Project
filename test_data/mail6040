Miami (Western Apache: Goshtish T[3]) is a town in Gila County, Arizona, United States. Miami is a classic Western copper boomtown, though the copper mines are largely dormant now. Miami's old downtown has been partly renovated, and low-cost housing is attracting new residents.[citation needed] According to the 2010 Census, the population of the town was 1,837.[1] Miami is located at 332346N 1105219W / 33.39611N 110.87194W / 33.39611; -110.87194 (33.396248, -110.871848).[4] According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of .9 square miles (2.3km2), all of it land. Miami is adjacent to Globe, and near the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation. Miami, Globe, and the unincorporated areas nearby (including Inspiration, Claypool and Central Heights-Midland City) are commonly called Globe-Miami. The town is located on the northeastern slope of the Pinal Mountains, and is surrounded (except to the east) by the Tonto National Forest. It is located on U.S. Routes 60 and 70, and is served by the Arizona Eastern Railway. As of the census[5] of 2000, there were 1,936 people, 754 households, and 493 families residing in the town.
