Samuel Howe Barnes (1808 - November 13, 1860 Norwich, Chenango County, New York) was an American politician from New York. He married Harriet Pellet and they had six children. On November 6, 1860, he was elected a Canal Commissioner on the Republican ticket, but died a week later, before the beginning of his term.
