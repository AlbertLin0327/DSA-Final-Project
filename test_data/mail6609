Peach Princess is a California-based English translator, publisher and distributor of Japanese bishjo games; so far, all its releases have been eroge, which has made it one of the few companies in North America with games rated "Adults Only" by the ESRB. Many of Peach Princess' releases to date were developed by Crowd, a Japanese bishjo games studio, such as Brave Soul, Tokimeki Check-In!, Water Closet: The Forbidden Chamber, and the X-Change series. It is part of the J-List/JAST USA/G-Collections group of companies, owned by Peter Payne.[1] Its forums are one of the most common gathering places on the Internet for English-speaking fans of bishjo games, even those not distributed by Peach Princess, and the company watches the posts in the forums to gauge opinions of current and potential future releases.[citation needed] Peach Princess has published over 15 games in the United States. All games published so far have been only available on Microsoft Windows. All games have been released in Japan earlier by their original publisher which is normally the developer of the game.[2][3]
