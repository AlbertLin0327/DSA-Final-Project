The Kuratau River is a river of the centre of New Zealand's North Island. It flows generally eastwards, initially flowing southeast from its sources in rough hill country south of the Pureora Forest Park before turning northeast to reach the small Lake Kuratau. From here it flows east five further kilometres before flowing into the southwest of Lake Taupo close to the settlement of Kuratau. "Place Name Detail: Kuratau River".
