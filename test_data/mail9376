Elachista cordata is a moth of the Elachistidae family. It is found in Cameroon.[1] The wingspan is 8.7-8.8 mm. The forewing ground colour is white, the base of the costa and the dorsum with a narrow irregular dark brown blotch, sometimes tinged with ochreous. The hindwings are brownish grey. Adults have been recorded in early May. The species name is derived from the Latin cordatus (meaning heart shaped) and refers to the shape of the gnathos.
