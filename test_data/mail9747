Statistics South Africa (frequently shortened to Stats SA) is the national statistical service of South Africa, with the goal of producing timely, accurate, and official statistics in order to advance economic growth, development, and democracy. To this end, Statistics South Africa produces official demographic, economic, and social censuses and surveys. To date, Statistics South Africa has produced two censuses, in 1996 and 2001; it is currently preparing for the 2011 census. Stats SA was previously known as the Central Statistical Service; shortly after the end of apartheid it absorbed the statistical services of the former Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei. Statistics South Africa has been criticized for not producing accurate figures on immigration[2] and inflation[3].
