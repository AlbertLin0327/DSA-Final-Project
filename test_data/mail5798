Kruidnoten are a cookie-like kind of confectionery, traditionally associated with the early December Sinterklaas holiday in the Netherlands. People sometimes confuse Kruidnoten with Pepernoten.[1][2] Kruidnoten (literally, 'spice nuts'), are harder, have different colour and shape and are made using the same ingredients[clarification needed] used for making speculaas.[3] There is another variety of Kruidnoten called 'chocolade-kruidnoten'. These are regular kruidnoten covered in either milk, dark or white chocolate.[4]
