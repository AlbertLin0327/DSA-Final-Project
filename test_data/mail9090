The Deadweights are an influential American punk rock band, formed in New York City in 1978. The Deadweights began when James "White Jimmy" White and Eddie Urland left their prior bands. The two soon joined with numerous local punk musicians. Early members included both Raymond Pettibon and future Xes bassist Hank Leary. Eventually, Dean "Dopey" Haydenbaugh and Richard "Ricky Scaggs" Scaglione would become the permanent drummer and bassist respectively. Originally using the name "Deadwaves", the band eventually settled on The Deadweights by the end of 1978. They began appearing regularly at local NYC clubs, most notably CBGB. In 1980 they were offered a recording contract from Sire Records but rejected it. The band independently released two singles in the following months, "Hostility" and "Dropping Neurotoxins", which would only increase attention toward the band. Eventually they signed with Slash Records, after they allowed the band creative freedom, and began work on their full length debut album. The band's debut album, First Wave Complete Destruction, was released in May 1981.[1] The album contained new songs as well as the band's previous singles. The album is seen as being one of the best of the early 1980s punk movement. Despite the band's large local following, the album failed to attract any mainstream attention. In the year following its release, punk fell out of the mainstream as new music styles such as New Wave and Heavy metal gained in popularity. In 1982, the band returned from a national tour to New York and took some time off. In early 1983, the band recorded their second album. June 1983 marked the release of their second album, the self-titled The Deadweights. During the touring for this album, Dean was found to be in possession of heroin at a gig in Detroit, Michigan and had to be extradited to New York. He was replaced for the rest of the touring by Paul Theissen. The incident supposedly "scared the rest of the band into sobriety for the rest of tour", according to Ricky Scaggs. In 1984, Paul was replaced by Dean. In 1985, the band began work on their third album. Released in September 1985, the band's third album was released. Crisis was received by many[who?] as the band's finest work to date, and was their first album to chart on the Billboard Top 200. The album is considered one of the greatest punk albums of the 1980s, and to some, of all time. However, band tensions began to take a toll on the band. Dean Haydenbaugh left the band after the late 1985 tour of the US, and was replaced a second time by Paul Theissen. Both White Jimmy and Ricky Scaggs had failed attempts in rehab, and their 1986 tour ended when the band was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct. For the remainder of that year, the band was in hiatus and had little contact. In Spring 1987, Dean Haydenbaugh rejoined the band and they began work on a fourth album. The album was said to be a departure from the band's usual punk sound. Prophecies of Beautiful Regression was released on August 4, 1987. The sound of the album was much more experimental then previous efforts, with a more diverse collection of songs. However, tensions in the band were at an all time high. Two dates into touring, Dean Haydenbaugh departed a third time, and the band recruited Jackson Hein on drums. Halfway through touring, the band had enough, and announced their disbandment in December 1987. In 1995, nearly 8 years since the band's fallout, White Jimmy and Eddie Urland performed together for a show at CBGB. Shortly afterword, the two announced the band would reunite, much to the shock of fans. With the reunited lineup of Jimmy, Eddie, Dean, and Ricky, the band performed select dates on Lollapalooza 1995. In 1996 the band began working on a new album, and toured independently. Finally, almost 10 years since their last album, the band's fifth album was released. February 11, 1997 marked the release of Recalled to Life, which was heralded as a comeback of true punk amongst the pop punk revival of recent years. The band embarked on their most successful tour to date for the remainder of the year. By 1998, the band had returned to uncertainty, with a hiatus of undisclosed length. A live album, Look at this Mess!, was released in mid 1998, which contained live performances from the 2 reunion tours. In early 2001, the band returned and toured U.S. clubs. At the end of the year, the band returned to the studio to work on a sixth album. On May 28, 2002, the band released the studio album, Animosity, and began a world tour which culminated in 2003 with another silent period. In late 2005, Urland announced that 2006 would see another club tour. In the summer of 2006, the band did tour select U.S. clubs, and claimed to be working on a seventh album. After a show at CBGB on October 12, 2006 (one of the final shows to be performed there), the band said they were not working on new material. In the Summer of 2007, the band toured US clubs yet again, and said there would definitely be new material in the next year or so. In September 2007, Urland announced the band was in the studio and recording a new album. White Jimmy also added the album will be released in January or February 2008 and feature an Orwellian influence.[2] In November 2007, the band announced that the album, titled From the Age of Doublethink would be released on February 5, 2008, along with the album's final tracklisting.[3] The album's first single, "Army Ants", was released to radio on January 1, 2008.[4] From the Age of Doublethink was released on February 5, 2008. The band toured the U.S. from May until July, and Europe in August of the year. On August 26, 2008, the band released New Oldspeak, an EP featuring songs not included in From the Age of Doublethink. In 2010, White Jimmy performed with the former members of the band Guantanamo as The Gitmo Condemned. Together, they released the album Guilty Parties on September 6, 2011.
