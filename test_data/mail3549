Xuly Bt Funkin' Fashion Factory, or Xuly Bt, is a line of clothing designed by Lamine Badian Kouyat, born 28 Dec 1962, a Malian fashion designer. The Xuly Bt Funkin' Fashion Factory, or Xuly Bt, collection has been awarded with the Creator of the Year award by the New York Times in 1994 and received the ANDAM award in 1996. The collection was also a part of the Africa 2005 exhibit at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Kouyat moved from his native Bamako, Mali to Paris, France around 1986. He launched Xuly Bt (Keep an open mind in Wolof) in 1989, when he fell in love with the Parisian fashion scene, while studying architecture in at Ecole Nationale Suprieure d'Architecture de Strasbourg (the Strasbourg School of Architecture). Kouyat's knack for recycling flea market finds, and patching them together with an African sensibility is what has brought him to mainstream recognition. He cites designers Azzedine Alaia and Yves Saint Laurent, contemporary Africa, and both punk rock and funk as influences for his funky fashions.
