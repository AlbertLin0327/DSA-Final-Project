The Skipanon River is a tributary of the Columbia River, approximately 7 miles (11km) long, on the Pacific coast of northwest Oregon in the United States. It is the last tributary of the Columbia on the Oregon side, draining an area of coastal bottom land bordered by sand dunes and entering the river from the south at its mouth west of Astoria. The Skipanon River issues from Cullaby Lake in western Clatsop County, northeast of Seaside and less than 3 miles (4.8km) from the ocean. It flows north parallel to the coast and east of U.S. Route 101. It enters the northwest end of Youngs Bay at the mouth of the Columbia approximately 1 mile (1.6km) northeast of Warrenton. The mouth of the river is at river mile 10.7 miles (17.2km) of the Columbia upstream from its mouth. The river's name comes from the Clatsop language, originally referring to a point at the river's mouth rather than the river itself. The charts of the Lewis and Clark Expedition show the stream as Skipanarwin Creek. Another variant spelling, Skeppernawin, was common on maps into the 20th century.[1]
