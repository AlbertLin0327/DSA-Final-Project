ESPN2 College Football Friday Primetime is a live game presentation of Division 1-A college football on ESPN2 or sometimes ESPN. There is no main sponsor. The game telecast airs every Friday night at 7:45pm ET during the college football regular season. In 2010, the games will be announced by Joe Tessitore and Rod Gilmore. The game is preceded by a 5-10 minute long segment of College Football Scoreboard with Rece Davis, Lou Holtz and Mark May They both also present the Pontiac Performance Halftime Report. Since debuting in 2004, it has broadcast games from numerous conferences including the SEC, ACC, Big Ten and the Big East. The biggest game for this package occurred on September 28, 2007, when the at the time fifth-ranked West Virginia Mountaineers took on the eighteenth-ranked South Florida Bulls. The game drew a 2.7 rating, the second highest since ESPN2 began televising college football.
