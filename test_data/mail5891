Ada Karmi-Melamede (Hebrew:  -; born 1936) is a noted Israeli architect. Karmi-Melamede was born on December 24, 1936 in Tel Aviv, in Mandate Palestine (now Israel).[1] She studied at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London from 1956 to 1959 and at the Technion  Israel Institute of Technology from 1961 to 1962, being awarded her degree in 1963. In 1986 she and her brother Ram Karmi won an international competition to design the Supreme Court of Israel compound, which opened in 1992.[2] New York Times architecture critic Paul Goldberger wrote of the design, "the sharpness of the Mediterranean architectural tradition and the dignity of the law are here married with remarkable grace."[3]
