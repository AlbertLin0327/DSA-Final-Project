Mittelstrimmig in COC.svg Mittelstrimmig is an Ortsgemeinde  a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality  in the Cochem-Zell district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Zell, whose seat is in the municipality of Zell an der Mosel. Mittelstrimmig lies together with the neighbouring municipality of Altstrimmig on a high ridge in the northern Hunsrck roughly 30km from Frankfurt-Hahn Airport. Mittelstrimmig is the biggest village in the so-called Strimmiger Berg and, thanks to a great deal of woodlands, is among the Hunsrcks wealthiest municipalities. Outside the built-up lands within the municipality, land use breaks down as follows: The figures are from the Daun Land Survey and Cadastral Office (Vermessungs- und Katasteramt Daun), dated 2 August 2005. Along todays Landesstrae (State Road) 202 between Mittelstrimmig and Blankenrath, remnants of a Roman settlement, or vicus, were found. Later research brought to light that an important Roman highway once led through the area. The local school chronicle has this to say about it: it is a fact that in the district called Die Mauer (The Wall), the clear remnants of an establishment of great extent, destroyed by violence, can still be made out today The first documentary mention of the name Strimmig  shared by Mittelstrimmig, Altstrimmig and the Strimmiger Berg  is to be found in a document from Count Simon I of Sponheim-Kreuznach from the year 1259, in which Heinrich, Lord of Ehrenberg, settled the matter of the inheritance from the County of Sayn with Count Simon with regards to the Vogtei of Strimmig. Mittelstrimmig belonged in the Middle Ages to the three-lord courts. In Mittelstrimmig, the three lords were: the Electorate of Trier, Sponheim and Braunshorn (until 1367). In 1437, Johann von Sponheim, the last Count of the ruling house of Sponheim, died. The County passed unpartitioned  as a condominium  to Margrave Bernhard of Baden and Count Friedrich at Veldenz. To this also belonged the Sponheim share in the three-lord court, which was administered by either Kastellaun or Trarben. In 1444, after Count Friedrichs death, came the merger of the County of Veldenz with the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrcken under Duke Friedrich I. About 1637, the family Winneburg-Beilstein, the Braunshorns heirs, died out. The lordship was taken over by the family Metternich, but only years later, about 1652. About 1776, the greater County of Sponheim was split up, with the three-lord part passing to Palatinate-Zweibrcken. Under the treaties of 1780 and 1784, the three-lord territory was itself dismembered. The Lords of Winneburg-Beilstein, or rather their successors, came into possession of the Vogtei of Strimmig. Beginning in 1794, Mittelstrimmig lay under French rule. In 1814 or 1815, Mittelstrimmig was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Despite greater freedom of travel, begging and vagrancy remained punishable. The problem of those with no fixed address, without social safeguards or possibility of taking care of their own livelihoods also affected the villages on the Strimmiger Berg. About 1842, the Prussian government passed a law requiring every Prussian citizen to have a permanent domicile, and requiring every municipality to house any family that was willing to settle. Many members of Prussian societys homeless wanderers seized the opportunity. This led in the villages on the Strimmiger Berg to the establishment of what were called Ortsteile Klein-Frankreich (roughly Little France Neighbourhoods). The dwellers of these new neighbourhoods were ordinary municipal citizens, but the long-established villagers continued to exclude them socially. Between 1817 and 1830, Mittelstrimmig, like the other municipalities, was self-administering. The 19th century was in Mittelstrimmig, as it was throughout Germany, a time of yearning to emigrate to the United States, for the region that now makes up Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse was seething with political discontent at this time, and there was a dearth of gainful work. After the French Revolution had ended, hopes began to grow that the social situation would become better. This, however, did not happen. On 26 May 1852, 151 persons (56 of whom were 14 or younger, the rest of whom were over 14) left Mittelstrimmig for New York, landing there on 13 June of the same year. They made their new homes in Wisconsin in, among other places, Green Bay, Washington County, Sheboygan, Milwaukee, Germantown, Farmington, Cedarburg and Appleton. Another wave of emigration followed in July of the very next year. This saw 39 persons leave, also bound for New York, with their route going by way of Cologne, Antwerp, Liverpool or Hamburg and Bremen. The rest of the emigrants  54 persons  left Mittelstrimmig between 1829 and 1890 bound for North or South America. The parts of South America that some went to were the areas around Porto Alegre, Santa Cruz do Sul and San Jos. These communities can still be found today in Novo Hamburgo (called Neu Hamburg in German), So Leopoldo and Rio Grande. Thirty-one newspapers and more than 150 clubs were founded by the colonists. The cost of the voyage was 22,015 Thaler, 221 Silbergroschen and 46 Pfennigs; for all emigrants from Mittelstrimmig, Altstrimmig, Liesenich, Grenderich and Senheim, the cost was covered by their respective municipalities. Mittelstrimmig had to pay 5,578 Thaler of this amount. For the 1852 travel costs alone, 308 Morgen (roughly 9.8ha) of forest had to be felled, among other things. To the people in the Hunsrck, the wars imminence was something that was unknown. Only in mid July 1914 did it become apparent that a military conflict of some kind lay just ahead. On 6 August, Kaiser Wilhelm II issued a decree. A few days later, soldiers from Mittelstrimmig were leaving their homeland. With Germanys defeat, the people in Mittelstrimmig saw the world that they had known fall apart. Not only was the monarchy gone, but the toll in blood had been quite high. Nine men from Mittelstrimmig had fallen for Empire and Emperor. When soldiers withdrew from the villages, they left behind weapons and ammunition. Civilians took these and used them for hunting. With the German soldiers gone, the villages on the Strimmiger Berg were occupied by the Americans, who were billeted in barns, stables, barrooms at inns and schools. Once Germany had been divided into occupation zones by the victorious powers, the Americans withdrew and the Rhineland, and along with it the Strimmiger Berg, once again fell under French rule. In the early 1920s, many young men left the Strimmiger Berg to go to Cologne, where money could be earned in factories and coalpits. However, once the French and Belgians occupied the Ruhr area in 1923, they came back home. As was so throughout Germany, make-work measures were undertaken. Several roads were built on the Strimmiger Berg by means of the Ruhr impost. Owing to inflation, a 21-year-old worker earned up to 35,000 Marks each day. Now, in a reversal of the former trend, people from Cologne were coming to Strimmig to hoard, steal and trade. The farmers, though, were unwilling to yield up very much, given the moneys meagre worth. On this subject, one chronicle had this to say: if one gets any money, one must right away buy something with it  the market value changes several times daily. At this time, one pays for 1 American dollar 4 trillion Marks, for one French franc, 1 billion 1 hundred million, where before one would have paid 4.20 Marks and 80 Pfennigs respectively. a 3 pound loaf of bread costs 170 million, a pound of butter 1-2 trillion Daily people come from the Moselle and offer sugar, brandy in trade Bills are reckoned in fruit, as oats, barley and wheat are very much coveted. The Second World War began on 1 September 1939. Already by 26 or 27 August, 9 men from Mittelstrimmig had to man the anti-aircraft gun battery (Flugabwehrstelle, or FLUWA) in the cadastral area known as Galgenflur. Up to 1942, roughly 75 men from Mittelstrimmig were called into the forces, 28 of whom fell in the war (in, among other places, Stalingrad); a further 17 are missing in action to this day. Mittelstrimmig and Forst were the only two villages that came through the war unscathed in any bombing or grenade attack. Only one aircraft ever crashed within Mittelstrimmigs limits, having been shot down by an RAF bomber. The Flak battery in Mittelstrimmig was meant to defend Koblenz against Allied air-raids. When the war reached Koblenz in 1943, people fled, seeking shelter in slate caves and shacks. Since 1946, Mittelstrimmig has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Until 1970, the municipality belonged to the Verbandsgemeinde of Senheim. However, after state administrative reform, it became part of the newly formed Verbandsgemeinde of Zell in the Cochem-Zell district. The name Strimmig, formerly Stremig or Stremich, is of Slavic-Celtic origin. Strymu means hanging or sloping, and is held to mean on the slope. The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.[2] Mittelstrimmigs mayor is Lothar Jakobs, and his deputies are Heiko Theisen and Thomas Egon.[3] The German blazon reads: Das Wappen von Mittelstrimmig ist schrg geteilt. Von Gold und Grn senkrecht gebrochen. In Gold ist ein Eichenblatt mit 2 Eicheln in silberner Frucht. In Grn eine 5-endiges Hirschgeweih. The municipalitys arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per bend fracted per pale in the middle, Or an oakleaf bendwise slipped vert fructed of two argent and vert a stags attire of five points bendwise of the first. The oakleaf stands for the municipalitys extensive forests, and the stags antler for the wildlife. The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinates Directory of Cultural Monuments: Although not a listed building, the Weimhle (White Mill) is also to be found in Mittelstrimmig. Part of the film Der Schinderhannes  the title characters homecoming with his girlfriend Julchen Blasius to his fathers house  was made here. Another mill in the municipality is the one mentioned above in connection with the chapel with the ridge turret, the Hannosiusmhle, which nowadays houses a clinic that treats addictions. Life in Mittelstrimmig is characterized, as in other villages, by its clubs. Almost all clubs have names containing the placename Strimmig. Among the regular events in Mittelstrimmig are the Maikirmes (May Fair), which is held on the second weekend in May. One event of national importance is the International Federation of Popular Sports (Internationaler Volkssportverband or IVV) hike on the second or third weekend in September, which is attended by hiking enthusiasts from all over Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse, Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands. Saint Philips and Saint Jamess Church (Kirche St. Philippus und Jakobus) was built between 1766 and 1769 and cost, according to a surviving request document sent to the then Prince-Archbishop-Elector of Trier, Johann Phillip von Walderdorf, 2,000 Reichsthaler. The first work to strengthen the churchs structure was undertaken as early as 1777. Further work needed to be done in 1845, 1861, 1863, 1881 and 1883. Remodelling between 1959 and 1962 fundamentally altered the church, with the chancel and quire being completely changed. Mittelstrimmig managed to keep its church bells in the First World War while others were being seized in the war effort to be melted down. What they were spared in the Great War, however, they were not spared in the Second World War; in 1943, the Army High Command decided to take the bells for war requirements. In 1951, however, sacrifices by the parish made it possible for the church to obtain four new steel bells, listed in the table at right. One of the old bells was actually saved from the Wehrmacht. It dates from 1373 and is now at the church in Altstrimmig. Mittelstrimmig is home to three Heiligenhuschen  small, shrinelike structures, each consecrated to a saint or saints. The Dietzen-Heiligenhuschen between Mittelstrimmig and Liesenich was built in 1700 by the Schffe (roughly lay jurist) Johann Dietzen. In 2003, it was completely renovated. The figures were stolen by a thief from Valwig, but were replaced. The Schock-Heiligenhuschen was built in the 18th century and stands on Landesstrae (State Road) 202 between Mittelstrimmig and Blankenrath. A parallel path leads to the Galgenflur (roughly, Gallows Field). The Schock-Heiligenhuschen was every condemned mans last stop on the way to the gallows. There is a third Heiligenhuschen in the cadastral area called Konnel. In Mittelstrimmig are found the Kindergarten Strimmiger Berg and the Grundschule Strimmiger Berg (primary school), which are also attended by children from surrounding villages. Secondary schools are to be found in Blankenrath, Kastellaun, Zell and Cochem.
