Holly Yashi, Inc. is a jewelry designer and manufacturer located in the northern California town of Arcata, CA. Founded in 1981, Holly Yashi produces hand-made jewelry designed by Holly Hosterman, who has been recognized for her distinctive use of the precious and highly reactive metal niobium.[1][2] Holly Yashi is also known for its technical innovations in working with niobium, such as the development of proprietary hand-coloration and image-embossing processes, as well as the employment of a powerful water jet which uses tiny fragments of crushed garnets to produce intricate filigree.[3][4] Holly Hosterman and Paul Lubitz founded Holly Yashi in their garage after graduating form Humboldt State University in 1981.[5] Hosterman's designs have been sold by brands such as Anthropologie and featured in magazines such as Good Housekeeping.[6] Her one-of-a-kind creations for the Swarovski company are now located in the Swarovski Museum in Austria.
