Su Hui (traditional Chinese: ; simplified Chinese: ; pinyin: S Hu, Fourth Century CE) was a Chinese poet of the Middle Sixteen Kingdoms period (304 to 439) during the Six Dynasties period. Her Chinese style name or courtesy name (z) is Yun Yan (traditional Chinese: ; simplified Chinese: ; pinyin: Ru Ln). She is most famous for her extremely complex "palindrome" (huiren) poem, apparently having innovated the genre, as well as producing the most complex example to date. Apparently, all of her other thousands of literary works have been lost.[1] The Jin Dynasty (265420) had briefly unified the Chinese empire, in 280, but from 291 to 306 a multi-sided civil war known as the War of the Eight Princes raged through northern China, devastating that part of the country. For the first thirteen years this was an all-out struggle for power for power among princes and dukes. Then in 304 CE the leader of the formerly independent ethnic nation of the Northern Xiongnu declared independence, under its newly declared Grand Chanyu, Liu Yuan (later Prince Han Zhao). Various other non-Chinese groups became involved, in what is known as the Wu Hu uprising, by 317 the last Jin prince left standing, now as emperor, ruled an empire reduced to its former southern area. And the former northern part of the Jin empire had been subdivided into a number of independent states. In 351, the state of Former Qin was founded, and by 376 it had succeeded in unifying northern China. Su Hui was a poet of the kingdom of Former Qin (351-394) She was from a literate family, in what is now now Fufeng County, in Shaanxi Province. She was the third daughter of Su Daozhi. Su Hui married at sixteen (fifteen, by Western reckoning), and went to live with her husband, Dou Tao, to what is now Qinzhou District, Tianshui, Prefecture, in Gansu Province, where he was the governor. She has an important and unusual poem, the "Xuanji Tu". The poem is in the form of a twenty-nine by twenty-nine character grid, and can be read forward or backwards, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This arrangement allows for 2,848 different readings.[2] Reproductions of the lost original of Su Hui's poem.
