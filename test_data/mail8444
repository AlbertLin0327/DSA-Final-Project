Content:
Chocolate-covered coffee beans are confections made by coating roasted coffee beans in some kind of chocolate: dark chocolate, milk chocolate, or even white chocolate. They are usually only slightly sweet, especially the dark chocolate kind, and the intense, bitter flavor of the coffee beans can be overwhelming for non-coffee-drinkers. Like all chocolate products, they are rich in fat, and since their main ingredient is coffee beans, they are very high in caffeine: for example, Shock-A-Lots have about 300 mg of caffeine per ounce. However, they also contain antioxidants and certain vitamins, so they may be beneficial when eaten in moderation. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
