The most specific prophecies are related to the rise and fall of leaders and organizations. Most of these prophesies can be found in Bah'u'llhs tablets to the kings and rulers of the world and in the Kitb-i-Aqdas.[1][2] Particularly potent to early Bah's was Bah'u'llh's prediction in 186869 of the fall of Sultan Abdlaziz, who was deposed in 1876.[3] Other prophecies, including statements from `Abdu'l-Bah, are general in nature, relating to the nature of future society, and the rise of the Bah' Faith to prominence.[1][4] Bah'u'llh in the Sriy-i-Ra's and the Lawh-i-Fu'd predicts that Sultan Abdu'l-Aziz will lose control of the Ottoman Empire.[3] Writing to `Al Psh, the Ottoman Prime Minister, Bah'u'llh wrote: Later in 1869, Bah'u'llh writing in the Lawh-i-Fu'd compares the Sultan and his Prime Minister to Nimrod and Pharaoh who rose up against Abraham and Moses and writes that they will lose power: Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz was deposed on May 30, 1876 and a fortnight later he was found dead in the palace where he had been confined, and trustworthy medical evidence attributed his death to suicide although many people believed he was murdered by a conspiracy. The prophecies in the Lawh-i-Fu'd regarding the downfall of the Sultan and the Prime Minister played an important role in Mrz Abu'l-Fadl, one of the Bah' Faith's foremost scholars, in conversion to the Faith, after the fulfilment of the prophecies.[5][6] `Al Pash was the Prime Minister of the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Abdu'l-Aziz; Bah'u'llh called him "the Chief." Bah'u'llh in the Sriy-i-Ra's and the Lawh-i-Ra's predicts that he will lose his power and station.[7] Writing to him in August 1868 Bah'u'llh wrote: Writing to him in another tablet Bah'u'llh states once again that he will lose his station and glory: `Al Pash died in office in 1871 after three months of illness. Napoleon III was the Emperor of the French from 1852 to 1870. In 1869 Bah'u'llh wrote to him in one of the five chapters that compose the Sriy-i-Haykal. In the tablet Bah'u'llh writes that if Napoleon III does not follow Bah'u'llh he will lose his kingdom and that commotion will occur in France:[8] Within the year, in battle against Prussia in July 1870, the Emperor was captured at the Battle of Sedan (September 2) and was deposed by the forces of the Third Republic in Paris two days later; he was sent into exile to England where he died. After Napoleon's capture by the Prussians, General Louis Jules Trochu and the politician Lon Gambetta overthrew the Second Empire and established the "Government of National Defence" which later became the conservative Third Republic. Its creation was overshadowed by the subsequent revolution in Paris known as the Paris Commune, which maintained a radical regime for two months until its bloody suppression in May 1871.  Bah'u'llh prophesized the fall of the Caliphate, the title of the head of state in Sunni Islam. From 1517 onwards, the Ottoman sultan was also the Caliph of Islam, and the Ottoman Empire was, from 1517 until 1922 (or 1924), synonymous with the Caliphate or the Islamic State. Addressing the people of Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, Bah'u'llh, in the Kitb-i-Aqdas which was completed in 1873, claims that the leaders of Constantinople, the Caliph, has been a source of tyranny, and that they will lose control:[9][10] On March 3, 1924, the first President of the Turkish Republic, Kemal Atatrk, constitutionally abolished the institution of the Caliphate. Its powers were transferred to the Turkish Grand National Assembly (parliament) of the newly formed Turkish nation-state and the title has since been inactive. Bah'u'llh wrote: Some point to this as a statement about the discovery of nuclear energy and the use of nuclear weapons.[15] Bah'u'llh also wrote that planets would be found around other star systems, and that life would be found on those planets: A modern understanding of star formation recognizes planets forming around any star. The term 'creature'[16] is used elsewhere in Bah' scripture by `Abdu'l-Bah to also include minerals, in addition to plants, animals, and humans.[17] In 1873 Bah'u'llh wrote in the Kitb-i-Aqdas:[18] This is elaborated specifically: Shoghi Effendi wrote:[19] Bah'u'llh wrote in the Kitb-i-Aqdas:[20] The first sign refers to the selection of a single language and the adoption of a common script: The second sign refers to the emergence of a "divine philosophy" which will include the discovery of a radical approach to the transmutation of elements: In Bah'u'llh's tablet addressed to Shaykh Salmn, he mentions a third sign, which is that no one will accept to bear the weight of kingship: Shoghi Effendi wrote:[4] This commonwealth must consist of: Further features: Shoghi Effendi wrote:[19] Bah'u'llh in the Kitb-i-Aqdas stated that the next Manifestation of God will not appear before 1000 years have passed since 1863, the year in which Bah'u'llh made public his claim to have received a revelation from God:[21] In a similar verse he says:
