Douglas County Courthouse is a historic courthouse at 1616 Eighth Street in Minden, Nevada, United States.[1] When the county seat moved to Minden from Genoa in 1916,[2] architects Frederick DeLongchamps and George L.F. O'Brien were hired to design a new courthouse for $700. The building was finished the same year by contractors Friedhoff and Hoeffel for $25,000.[3]
