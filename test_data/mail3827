Conrado del Campo (28 October 1878  17 March 1953) was a composer, violinist and professor at the Real Conservatorio de Msica in Madrid, who was the principal conductor of the Madrid Symphony Orchestra.His was works played in the Theathre Real of Madrid for Jos Mara Alvira. His opera Lola la Piconera made its debut at the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona, December 12, 1952. He was a major figure in the conservative musical climate of Franco's Spain, writing in a Late Romantic style. Since his death his music has fallen into comparative oblivion. He was born in Madrid, which is also where he died. Among his pupils were Salvador Bacarisse, Julin Bautista, and Fernando Remacha. Del Campo's characteristic symphonic music takes the form of evocative tone poems.
