The Codington County Heritage Museum is located in the county seat of Watertown, South Dakota.[1] It has occupied the Carnegie Library building in Watertown since it opened in 1974. The Carnegie Library was built in Watertown in 1906 through a grant from the Carnegie Foundation and functioned as a library until 1967 when operations moved to a new building further east in town next to what was then the newly-built Watertown Senior High School. A youth group briefly occupied the Carnegie Library building before its use by the Codington County Historical Society.[2] The museum is maintained by the Codington County Historical Society. The group was founded in 1970 and was officially incorporated in 1974.[1] They put out a bi-monthly publication for paid members entitled the Codington County Courier. In the past, the publication was called Wagon Wheels.
