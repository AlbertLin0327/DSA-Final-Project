The 1993-1994 season was the 114th season of competitive football in England. From the start of this season, the FA Premier League would be sponsored by Carling Breweries - an association which would last for eight years. The premier league was without a sponsor for the previous season. Manchester United broke the English transfer record before the start of the season by paying relegated Nottingham Forest 3.75million for promising young midfielder Roy Keane. The 22-year-old Irishman was signed by Alex Ferguson as a long-term replacement for Bryan Robson, who at 36 was in the twilight of his illustrious Old Trafford career. Graham Taylor resigned as England manager after their failure to qualify for the World Cup. He was succeeded by Terry Venables, the former Tottenham manager. Taylor had already been branded a Turnip by the Sun newspaper, after England lost 2-1 to the Swedish team in 1992, with their headline "Swedes 2, Turnip 1". Sir Matt Busby died on 20 January at the age of 84. He had been associated with Manchester United since being appointed manager at the end of the Second World War, and remained at the club as a director after calling time on his glorious managerial career in 1969. Manchester United won the Premiership title and F.A Cup to become only the fourth club this century to be league champions and F.A Cup winners in the same season. Only a 3-1 defeat against Aston Villa in the League Cup final prevented them from winning a unique treble of domestic trophies. They led the Premiership from the fourth game onwards and in the final table had an eight-point lead over second-placed Blackburn Rovers. French striker Eric Cantona scored 25 goals in all competitions and was voted PFA Player of the Year. Ryan Giggs, Lee Sharpe and Andrei Kanchelskis also hit the headlines with their brilliant form. In the F.A Cup final, United crushed Chelsea 4-0 thanks to two penalties from Eric Cantona and single goals from Mark Hughes and Brian McClair. Howard Kendall resigned three years into his second spell as Everton manager and was replaced by Norwich City's Mike Walker. They looked set for relegation from the Premiership on the final day of the season as they were 2-0 down to Wimbledon - just seven years after they had been league champions - but turned the tables on their opponents to win 3-2 and beat the drop. Sheffield United went down instead. Swindon Town, in the top division for the first time, were relegated from the Premiership after collecting just five wins, conceding 100 goals in 42 games. Many fans pointed the finger of blame at the club's directors for giving the manager's job to the inexperienced John Gorman. Swindon were joined in the crash-out zone by Sheffield United and Oldham Athletic. Bryan Robson left Manchester United after 13 years to become player-manager of Middlesbrough F.C. in place of Lennie Lawrence. Robson was impressed by the club's ambitions, which included plans for a new 30,000-seat stadium on the banks of the River Tees scheduled for completion in the summer of 1995. Robson brought in former Manchester United team-mate Viv Anderson as his assistant. Huddersfield Town relocated from Leeds Road to the new Alfred McAlpine Stadium at Kirklees. Their new home was initially a two-sided 15,000-seat stadium, with plans for an eventual capacity of 25,000. It took its name from the world famous building company, with which it had a 10-year sponsorship deal. After the end of the season, Tottenham Hotspur were deducted 5 points and were found guilty of financial irregularities dating back to the 1980s and hit with the most severe punishment handed down on any English club: a 600,000 fine, 12 league points deducted for the 1994-95 season, and a one-year ban from the F.A Cup. The points deduction and F.A Cup were eventually quashed after a series of appeals, although the fine was increased to 1.5million. Northampton Town, who spent one season in the top division during the 1960s, finished bottom of Division Three but retained their league status because Conference champions Kidderminster Harriers were unable to meet the Football League's minimum stadium capacity requirements. This was the first time that there had been no exits or arrivals in the Football League since the re-election system was scrapped in 1987. 15 September 1993: Darren Eadie, 18-year-old winger, makes his debut for Norwich City in their first ever European fixture - the UEFA Cup first round first leg clash with Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem. 22 September 1993: Robbie Fowler, 18-year-old striker, makes his debut for Liverpool in their 3-1 win at Fulham in the Football League Cup second round first leg. 29 September 1993: Stephen Carr, 17-year-old Irish defender, makes his debut for Tottenham Hotspur in a Premier League fixture against Ipswich Town at Portman Road. 3 November 1993: Ade Akinbiyi, 19-year-old London-born striker of Nigerian descent, makes his debut as a substitute for Norwich City in their UEFA Cup second round second leg fixture with Bayern Munich at Carrow Road, which ends in a 1-1 draw. 4 May 1994: Michael Duberry, 17-year-old defender, played in Chelsea's final Premier League game of the season - a 2-1 home defeat by Coventry City. [2] Notes = Number in parentheses is the times that club has won that honour (First Division & Premier League). Number after slash is Premier League only. * indicates new record for competition Even with the 7-1 victory over San Marino (in which Davide Gualtieri scores the fastest goal in World Cup history) England fail to qualify for the finals of the 1994 World Cup and manager Graham Taylor resigns within days of the defeat. Terry Venables is appointed as his replacement. Alan Smith kicked off his management career by guiding Crystal Palace to the Division One title and regaining their Premiership place at first time of asking. Frank Clark began Nottingham Forest's post Brian Clough era by helping them finish second in Division One and achieve promotion back to the Premiership. They were joined by playoff winners Leicester City who beat unlucky John King's Tranmere Rovers then local rival Derby County in the final which they finally made Premiership after two successive playoff final defeats. Oxford United's decline since losing their top flight status in 1988 continued as they slid into Division Two, along with Peterborough United (who had finished a strong 10th in the previous season, their first in the second tier) and Birmingham City. Mark McGhee won the Division Two championship for Reading after their first successful season in years. They were joined by John Rudge's Port Vale in second place. Burnley triumphed in the Division Two playoffs to come within one division of the top flight just seven years after they had almost gone down to the Conference. Going down to Division Three were Fulham (who would be in the league's lowest tier for the first time in their history), Hartlepool United, Exeter City and Barnet. Shrewsbury Town, Chester City and Crewe Alexandra occupied the three promotion places in Division Three, while Martin O'Neill's Wycombe Wanderers won the playoffs in their first season of league football. Northampton Town finished bottom of the league but were saved from demotion because Conference champions Kidderminster Harriers did not meet the league's stadium capacity requirements. For subsequent transfer deals see 1994-95 in English football. Eric Cantona received the PFA Player of the Year award after his 25 goals in all competitions were the key force in Manchester United's double glory. Alan Shearer was voted FWA Player of the Year after returning from injury to score 31 Premier League goals for runners-up Blackburn Rovers. Andy Cole was voted PFA Young Player of the Year after finishing top scorer in the Premier League with 34 goals for newly promoted Newcastle United, who finished third and qualified for Europe for the first time since the 1970s. Cole's veteran partner Peter Beardsley scored 25 league goals in his first season back on Tyneside. Dean Saunders was once again a consistent goalscorer for Aston Villa, who dipped to 10th in the league a year after finishing runners-up, but booked themselves another UEFA Cup campaign thanks to glory in the League Cup. 21-year-old striker Chris Sutton attracted huge attention from England's top clubs before his record-breaking transfer from Norwich City to Blackburn Rovers. Stan Collymore established himself as one of the country's top marksmen as he powered Nottingham Forest back into the Premier League at the first attempt. Veteran Reading striker Jimmy Quinn scored 35 league goals to lead his side to the Division Two title. Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest gained promotion to the Premiership in their first season under the respective management of Alan Smith and Frank Clark. Brian Little finally got it right with Leicester City as he helped them win promotion to the Premiership. Jimmy Mullen inspired Burnley's second promotion in two seasons as they won the Division Two playoffs. Martin O'Neill helped Wycombe Wanderers gain their second successive promotion and earn a place in Division Two. 26 September 1993: Stephen Carr, 17-year-old defender, makes his debut for Tottenham Hotspur in a 2-2 Premier League draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.[3] 21 January 1994: Mel Sterland, 32-year-old Leeds United defender, retires after failing to overcome an achilles injury suffered more than a year ago.[4] 2 May 1994: Frank Stapleton, 38-year-old former Arsenal and Manchester United striker, retires from playing after being dismissed as player-manager by Division Two club Bradford City.[5] 9 May 1994: Paul Elliott, 30-year-old Chelsea central defender, retires from playing 20 months after suffering a serious knee injury for which he is about to begin a legal challenge against Dean Saunders, the former Liverpool striker who collided with him when he was injured.[6] 31 May 1994: Kevin Moran, 38-year-old Blackburn Rovers central defender, announces his retirement as a player but will not retire completely until the end of the Republic of Ireland's World Cup campaign.[7] 1 July 1993 - Barnsley appoint Sheffield Wednesday defender Viv Anderson as their player-manager to succeed Mel Machin. 5 July 1993 - Gordon Cowans begins his third spell at Aston Villa after joining them on a free transfer from Blackburn Rovers, while Nottingham Forest pay 2million for 22-year-old Southend United striker Stan Collymore. 14 July 1993 - After Lee Chapman departs to Portsmouth on a free transfer, Leeds United replace him with record signing Brian Deane from Sheffield United for 2.9million, while England midfielder David Platt is transferred for the third year running when he leaves Juventus in a 5.2million move to Italian Serie A rivals Sampdoria. 16 July 1993 - Peter Beardsley returns to Newcastle United in a 1.4million move from Everton, six years after he left Tyneside for Liverpool. 17 July 1993 - The domestic transfer record is broken when Roy Keane signs for Manchester United from Nottingham Forest in a 3.75million deal. 20 July 1993 - For the first time in more than 40 years, the British transfer fee record is broken by a Scottish club rather than an English one, when Rangers sign Dundee United striker Duncan Ferguson for 4million. 26 July 1993 - Aston Villa sign Republic of Ireland midfielder Andy Townsend from Chelsea for 2.1million. 29 July 1993 - Former Manchester United, Everton and Wales winger Mickey Thomas, 39, is sentenced to 18 months in prison for producing and distributing forged banknotes.
