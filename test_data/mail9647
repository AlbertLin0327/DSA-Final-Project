Don't speak Russian? Click here to read a machine-translated version of the Russian article. Coordinates: 6740S 4550E / 67.667S 45.833E / -67.667; 45.833 Molodyozhnaya (Russian: ), (also known as "Molodezhnaya"), was a Soviet research station in East Antarctica at 6740S 4550E. Molodyozhnaya Station is located in the Thala Hills, 500-600 meters inland from the coast on the southern shore of Alasheyev Bight in the Cosmonaut Sea, at 42 meters above sea level. The area around the station is composed mostly of rocky ridges separated by snow-covered depressions and lakes. The sea near the station is covered in pack ice for much of the year, out to a distance of as much as 100 km at the end of winter. The rise to the summit of the massive East Antarctic Ice Sheet (Dome A) begins 1.5-2.0 km from the shore. Kheis Glacier is located in 15 km east of the station, and Campbell Glacier is roughly the same distance to the southwest.[1] The average temperature varies from 19 C in the coldest months (July-August), to around 0 C in January. There are plans to open the mothballed stations Molodyozhnaya, Leningradskaya and Russkaya in the 2007-2008 season. This will bring great benefits because these stations are located in the Pacific sector of Antarctica, which is poorly covered by scientific studies.
