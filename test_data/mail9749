Dicotylidae A peccary (plural peccaries; also javelina and skunk pig; Portuguese javali and Spanish jabal, sajino or pecar) is a medium-sized mammal of the family Tayassuidae, or New World pigs.[1] Peccaries are members of the artiodactyl suborder Suina, as are the pig family (Suidae) and possibly the hippopotamus family (Hippopotamidae).[2] They are found in the southwestern area of North America and throughout Central and South America. Peccaries usually measure between 90 and 130 centimetres (3.0 and 4.3 ft) in length, and a full-grown adult usually weighs between about 20 to 40 kilograms (44 to 88 lb). The word peccary is derived from the Carib word pakira or paquira.[3] People often confuse[4] peccaries, which are found in the Americas, with the pig family that originated in Afro-Eurasia, especially since some domestic pigs brought by European settlers have escaped over the years and now run wild as "razorback" hogs in many parts of the United States.[5] In many countries they are raised on farms and are a source of food for local communities, especially in the developing world.[6] Their skin, being both rigid and strong, as well as soft and supple, is recognized as being ideal for the production of leather gloves.[7] A peccary is a medium-sized animal, with a strong resemblance to pigs. Like pigs, it has a snout ending in a cartilagenous disc, and eyes that are small relative to its head. Also like pigs, it uses only the middle two digits for walking, although, unlike pigs, the other toes may be altogether absent. Its stomach is nonruminating, although it has three chambers, and is more complex than that of pigs.[8] Peccaries are omnivores, and will eat small animals, although their preferred food consists of roots, grass, seeds, fruit,[8] and cactiparticularly prickly pear cacti.[9] Pigs and peccaries can be differentiated by the shape of the canine tooth, or tusk. In European pigs, the tusk is long and curves around on itself, whereas in peccaries, the tusk is short and straight. The jaws and tusks of peccaries are adapted for crushing hard seeds and slicing into plant roots,[8] and they also use their tusks for defending against predators. The dental formula for peccaries is: Upper: 2.1.3.3, lower: 3.1.3.3 By rubbing the tusks together, they can make a chattering noise that warns potential predators not to get too close. Peccaries are aggressive enough in temperament that, unlike Eurasian pigs, they cannot be domesticated, as they are likely to injure humans. In recent years in northwestern Bolivia near Madidi National Park, large groups of peccaries have been reported to seriously injure or kill people.[10] Peccaries are social animals, and often form herds. Over 100 individuals have been recorded for a single herd of white-lipped peccaries, but collared and Chacoan peccaries usually form smaller groups. Such social behavior seems to have been the situation in extinct peccaries, as well. The recently discovered giant peccary (Pecari maximus) appears to be less social, primarily living in pairs.[11] Peccaries have scent glands below each eye and another on their back, though these are believed to be rudimentary in P. maximus. They use the scent to mark herd territories, which range from 75 to 700 acres (2.8km2). They also mark other herd members with these scent glands by rubbing one against another. The pungent odor allows peccaries to recognize other members of the herd, despite their myopic vision. The odor is strong enough to be picked up by humans, which earns the peccary the nickname of skunk pig. Today, four living species of peccary are found from the southwestern United States through Central America and into South America and Trinidad. The collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) or "musk hog," referring to the animal's scent glands, occurs from the southwestern United States into South America and the island of Trinidad. They are found in all kinds of habitats, from arid scrublands to humid tropical rainforests. The collared peccary is well adapted to habitat disturbed by humans, merely requiring sufficient cover; they can be found in cities and agricultural land throughout their range. Notable populations exist in the suburbs of Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, where they will feed on ornamental plants and other cultivated vegetation.[12][13] Collared peccaries are generally found in bands of eight to 15 animals of various ages. They will defend themselves if they feel threatened, but otherwise tend to ignore humans. They defend themselves with their long tusks, which sharpen themselves whenever the mouth opens or closes. A second species is the white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), which is found in the rainforests of Central and South America. The third species, the Chacoan peccary (Catagonus wagneri), is the closest living relative to the extinct Platygonus pearcei. It is found in the dry shrub habitat or Chaco of Paraguay, Bolivia and Argentina. The Chacoan peccary has the unusual distinction of having been first described based on fossils and was originally thought to be only an extinct species. In 1975, the animal was discovered to still be alive and well in the Chaco region of Paraguay. The species was well known to the native people. A fourth species, the giant peccary (Pecari maximus) was recently described from the Brazilian Amazon by Dutch biologist Marc van Roosmalen. Though recently discovered by science it has been known to the local Tupi people as Caitetu Munde, which means "great peccary which lives in pairs." [14][15] It is thought to be the largest extant peccary, and can grow to 1.2 metres (3.9ft) in length. Its fur is completely dark gray, with no collars whatsoever. Unlike other peccaries, it lives in pairs, or with one or two offspring. However, the scientific evidence for considering it as a species separate from the collared peccary has later been questioned.[16] Peccaries first appeared in the fossil records of the Late Eocene or Early Oligocene periods in Europe. Fossils have later been found in all continents except Australia and Antarctica. It became extinct in the Old World sometime after the Miocene period. Macrogenis was one example of a Miocene peccary. Although they are common in South America today, peccaries did not reach that continent until about three million years ago during the Great American Interchange, when the Isthmus of Panama formed, connecting North America and South America. At that time, many North American animalsincluding peccaries, llamas and tapirsentered South America, while some South American species, such as the ground sloths, migrated north.[17]
