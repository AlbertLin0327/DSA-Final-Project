Lakhvinder Cheema was murdered in Southall, West London, by his former lover, Lakhvir Kaur Singh through the use of the poison aconitine. Singh became known as "The Curry Killer" due to the food to which the poison was added.[3][4] The case is of note due to the unusual and cruel method of killing and degree of premeditation, with Singh travelling to India to procure the ancient poison aconitine. Singh received a life sentence with a 23 year minimum term. Singh had engaged in a 16 year affair with Lakhvinder Cheema after his first marriage had failed. .[5] The main event leading up to the murder of Cheema was his breaking off the sixteen year affair he had been having with Singh to marry a younger woman in October 2008.[4] When Singh returned from a trip to India the following month, she brought back with her the Aconite that she would later use in the murders. On 27 January Singh went to the victim's home and laced a curry in his refrigerator with the poison as she knew that he and his fiance would eat that food later that evening.[4] After consuming dinner the victims soon began vomiting. Cheema's face became numb. He then lost his sight followed by the use of his arms and legs. During a 999 call he stated he had been poisoned by his ex-girlfriend.[6] Cheema's sister and sons drove the couple to hospital though Cheema died within an hour of arriving. Choough suffered the same symptoms but was placed into a medically induced coma and made a full recovery.[7] A month prior to his murder Cheema has also been hospitalised for a week with suspected poisoning after consuming food prepared by Singh.[8] The case gained attention due to the particularity cruel nature of Cheema's killing. Victims of aconite poisoning suffer severe vomiting, become paralysed and have the sensation of ants crawling over their body. Their organs stop working and they die from asphyxiation, yet they remain conscious throughout.[9] The case was also unusual, as the last prosecution for murder using aconite was that of George Henry Lamson in 1882.[citation needed] The trial took place at the Old Bailey in 2010.[8] Singh attempted to blame her brother in law Varinda for the crime but a lodger had witnessed her taking the curry out of the fridge on the day of the murder.[10] It was also revealed that a plastic bag containing brown powder was found in Singh's coat. She had claimed this was medication for a rash on her neck, whereas it was in fact aconite, matching the poison found in the curry.[6] Singh was convicted on 10 February 2010 of the murder of Lakhvinder Cheema and grievous bodily harm against his new fiance who survived the attack (Singh was acquitted of attempted murder). Singh was also acquitted of administering poison to her ex-lover's food on a previous occasion.[11] The Crown had sought life imprisonment for Singh with a minimum term of 30 years, due to the gravity of the case and the level of premeditation involved in addition to the fact there had been two victims. Singh received a life sentence with a 23 year minimum term.[11]
