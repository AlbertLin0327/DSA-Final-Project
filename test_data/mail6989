Robinson's mouse opossum (Marmosa robinsoni) is a species of opossum in the family Didelphidae.[2] It is found in Belize, Colombia, Ecuador, Grenada, Honduras, Panama, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela.[1] Robinson's mouse opossums move along tree branches and vines with the help of a prehensile tail and may leap between gaps as they search for fruit and insects.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
