Roger M. Milgrim (born March 22, 1937, in New York City) is a leading intellectual property lawyer, and the author of two four-volume law treatises widely used in the legal profession: Milgrim on Trade Secrets (published in 1967 and updated three times per year: in early 2011, in its 95th edition) and Milgrim on Licensing (published in 1990 and updated semiannually: in 2011 in its 33rd edition). These works are companions to other major intellectual property treatises in the LexisNexis IP series, which includes Chisum on Patents and Nimmer on Copyright, which treatises are considered the leading treatise in their respective field, and are routinely cited by the U.S. Supreme Court and virtually all other courts. Milgrim was a Root-Tilden Scholar at NYU School of Law, and won the National First Prize in the Nathan Burkan competition, awarded by the American Society of Authors, Composers & Publishers (ASCAP) for his essay on territoriality of copyright.[1] He did graduate comparative law studies at NYU and the University of Paris School of Law as a Ford Foundation Fellow and a Fulbright Scholar.[2]* He was the first American associate in the Paris office of Baker & McKenzie, then the largest international law firm, and entered practice in New York as an associate in Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander & Mitchell, where he served as a personal attorney to Richard Nixon, later the 37th president of the United States, and as the senior associate in the case that Mr. Nixon argued before the U.S. Supreme Court, Hill v. Time, Inc., 385 U.S. 374 (1967). That case explored the relationship of the First Amendment and the Right of Privacy. In 1968 Milgrim co-founded the firm of Milgrim Thomajan & Lee, which was soon listed in The American Lawyer first as one or the 25 leading small, and later, one of the 25 leading midsized law firms in the United States. By 1992 it had grown from two to 160 lawyers in five cities (NY, Boston, Austin (Texas), Washington, DC, and Los Angeles). In 1992 Milgrim and his firms intellectual property group joined the New York office of the law firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker, a prominent international law firm, where he served as a senior partner and held such positions as the head of the Firms intellectual property group and the Firms litigation department. In addition to practice, Milgrim taught trade secret and intellectual property law at NYU School of Law for over two decades, and has also lectured at numerous law schools, including Columbia, Fordham, Kansas, Loyola (Chicago), Stanford, Texas and Yale. He has been a principal speaker before many bar associations, including those of California, Illinois, Michigan, New York and Texas. He was one of four speakers at the Tokyo Press Club where the then new Japanese Unfair Competition Prevention Law [3] was discussed before an audience of Japanese executives and lawyers; the other three speakers were the heads of the Japanese and U.S. patent offices and a professor from the Max Planck Institute (Japanese law is based on the German Civil Code). Milgrim was the first Deans Distinguished Lecturer at the Annenberg School for Communication of the University of Pennsylvania, which lecture, the following year, was given by Cass Sunstein, professor of law (then at the University of Chicago) and currently the Advisor to the White House for Information and Regulatory Affairs, advising president Barack Obama. Milgrim has also lectured to numerous legal departments, including AT&T, Eastman Kodak, Exxon, PPG, Procter & Gamble and United Technologies. He has been listed in Americas Best Lawyers in every year since its inception in 1980, not only in the intellectual property category but also on occasion in the field of corporate law. In addition to an active transactional and litigation practice, he has been active as a lawyers lawyer, serving as an expert witness in the field of trade secret and intellectual property licensing practices in over 35 litigations, having been retained by a wide variety of law firms including Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, Gibson, Dunn, Hogan & Hartson, Keker & Van Nest, Kirkland & Ellis, Latham & Watkins, Quinn Emanuel, Skadden Arps, Sullivan & Cromwell, White & Case and Wilson Sonsini. Milgrim has served on the boards of directors of Technip (a Paris-based NYSE-Euronext major international engineering firm, which is one of the CAC 40 public companies, the French equivalent of the Dow Jones Industrials), Coflexip-Stenna, and on the boards of not for profits, such as The Fulbright Association and The Brooklyn Hospital.[4] [1] "Territoriality of Copyright: An Analysis of Assignability Under the Universal Copyright Convention," 12 ASCAP Copyright L.
