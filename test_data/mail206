Mark A. Pinsky (born 15 July 1940)[citation needed] is Professor of Mathematics at Northwestern University. His research areas include probability theory, mathematical analysis, Fourier Analysis and wavelets. Pinsky earned his Ph.D at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His published works include 125 research papers and 10 books[citation needed], including several conference proceedings and textbooks. His most recent book Introduction to Fourier Analysis and Wavelets has been translated into Spanish.[citation needed] Pinsky has been at Northwestern since 1968,[1] following a two-year postdoctoral position at Stanford[citation needed]. He completed the Ph.D. at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1966[citation needed], under the direction of Henry McKean and became Full Professor in 1976.[chronology citation needed] He has been married to artist Joanna Pinsky since 1963; they have three children, Seth, Jonathan, and Lea, and four grandchildren, Nathan, Jason, Justin, and Jasper. [2] Pinsky is a member of the American Mathematical Society (AMS)[citation needed], Institute of Mathematical Statistics[citation needed], Mathematical Association of America[citation needed], and has provided services for Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), most recently as Consulting Editor for the AMS[citation needed]. He served on the Executive Committee of MSRI for the period 19962000[citation needed]. Pinsky was an invited speaker at the meeting to honor Stanley Zietz in Philadelphia at University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, March 20, 2008[citation needed]. Pinsky is a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics[citation needed] and member of the Editorial Board of Journal of Theoretical Probability.[3] His early work was directed toward generalizations of the central limit theorem, known as random evolution, on which he wrote a monograph in 1991[citation needed]. At the same time he became interested in differential equations with noise, computing the Lyapunov exponents of various stochastic differential equations. His current interests include classical harmonic analysis and stochastic Riemannian geometry[citation needed]. The Pinsky phenomenon, a term coined by J.P. Kahane[citation needed], hasn't become a popular topic for research in harmonic analysis[citation needed]. Pinsky was coordinator of the twenty-ninth Midwest Probability Colloquium, held at Northwestern University in October 2007.[4] See list of publication with pdfs.
