The 1959 U.S. Open was the 59th U.S. Open. The golf tournament was held June 1013, 1959, at Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, New York. Billy Casper won his first U.S. Open title with an one-stroke victory over Bob Rosburg Billy Casper began the final round with a three-stroke lead over Ben Hogan. Hogan, however, failed to make a charge and struggled to a 76, finishing in 8th. Instead it was Bob Rosburg who made a run at Casper's lead. Rosburg holed out a bunker shot for birdie at 11, and then made a 50-footer for another birdie at 12 to draw even with Casper. A three-putt at the 13th, however, meant Rosburg had to birdie the last to force a playoff. Instead, his approach fell 30-feet short, and all he could manage was a two-putt from there to finish a stroke back. Casper's final-round 74 was not a great round, but it proved to be enough. The difference for Casper proved to be his putting. He needed only 114 putts over 72 holes, one-putting 31 times and having only one three-putt. This U.S. Open would be the first to be played over four days; the final round on Saturday afternoon was postponed by rain. Charlie Sifford, the pioneering African-American golfer, played in his first major championship, two years before the PGA of America allowed African-Americans to play on the PGA Tour; he finished in 32nd place.
