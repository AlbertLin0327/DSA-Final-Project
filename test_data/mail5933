Jens-Peter Rossen Bonde (born on 27 March 1948 in Aabenraa) is a former Member of the European Parliament with the June Movement. He resigned as an MEP in May 2008.[1] Bonde was elected to the European Parliament in the first election in 1979 with the People's Movement against the EU. He has been re-elected 6 times consecutively. In 1992 he co-founded the June Movement which he chaired until his retirement May 2008. Bonde is still a member of the June Movement. He frequently appears in the media to comment on EU affairs. Jens-Peter Bonde emerged from the Danish Left of the 1970s, however he has been on the centre-left for most of the past three decades. In November 2005 he was the inspiration behind the setting up of a new Party at a European level, EUDemocrats. He was its President from 2005 to 2009.[2] Bonde has written about 60 books on the EU, including editions of EU treaties with additional commentary.[3] Jens-Peter Bonde is the son of Nina Bonde and Nis Bonde. He is married to Lisbeth Kirk and has 4 sons and one grandson.[4] On 25 March 2008, Bonde announced his retirement from the European Parliament.[5] Bonde intended to spend more time encouraging the growth of parties similar to the June Movement in the rest of Europe and building the EUDemocrats. He is also working for referendums on the Treaty of Lisbon. Bonde resigned his seat on 9 May 2008 and was replaced by Hanne Dahl, who was second on the June Movement's list of candidates in the 2004 election.[6] In January 2009 Bonde resigned as President of the EUDemocrats and was succeeded by Sren Wibe.
