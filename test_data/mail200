"Microphone Fiend" was the second single released from the hip hop duo Eric B. & Rakim's second album Follow the Leader. The song became something of a signature song for rapper Rakim, and Allmusic.com's Steve Huey says the song "weaves references to substance addiction throughout in explaining why Rakim can't keep away from the mic."[1] Featuring a prominent sample of Average White Band's 1975 hit "School Boy Crush," the song was further evidence of Eric B.'s fondness for soul samples and became one of most quoted songs in hip hop.
