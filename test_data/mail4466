The Delaware River Region refers to an area in western New Jersey along the Delaware River border with Pennsylvania. It encompasses Burlington County, Camden County, Gloucester County, Mercer County, and Salem County. The area is primarily part of Greater Philadelphia with the exception of Mercer County, which is part of the New York City Metropolitan Area. It is one of six officially recognized tourism regions[where?], the others being the Greater Atlantic City Region, the Skylands Region, the Southern Shore Region, the Shore Region and the Gateway Region.[1] Coordinates: 394629N 751304W / 39.7747N 75.2178W / 39.7747; -75.2178
