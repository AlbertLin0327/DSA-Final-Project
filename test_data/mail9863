Eros is the working title[1][2][3] of an unreleased album by American alternative metal band Deftones with tentative release dates in 2008 and 2009. The November 2008 car accident of bassist Chi Cheng forced the band to initially hold off on releasing the album, and later shelve the album indefinitely in a creative decision to move forward. With Cheng in a coma, Deftones recruited former Quicksand bassist Sergio Vega and released Diamond Eyes instead in 2010. The band still intends to release Eros at some point. Beginning with the writing process and subsequent rigorous touring schedule to promote Deftones' 2000 album White Pony, the relationship among band members started to dissolve.[4][5] This tension carried over to the recording of the group's fourth studio album, Deftones, in 2003, which was a dark and depressing record. Deftones were not pleased with the album they created and did not tour much in support of it. They soon started work on what would eventually become Saturday Night Wrist, a record that was pieced together with the members emailing each other their own recorded parts and not written as a full band.[4][6] In the middle of recording Saturday Night Wrist, Moreno went on a three month tour with his side project Team Sleep.[4][7] Deftones were on the verge of breaking up due to the unstable personal lives of each member both inside and outside of the band. This time period in the band's chronology is referred to by Deftones as "The Dark Days."[4][8][9] Prior to the tour in support of Saturday Night Wrist, a meeting was held with Deftones and their management about the fate of the band. When asked if the members still wanted to continue as a band, "The answer was a unanimous, 'Fuck yeah we do,'" which resulted in a "huge powwow and hug session."[4] This meeting was a major turning point for the inner-band morale. Hoping for a rapid turnaround from their previous album, Deftones quickly started writing music for Eros as early as May 2007, only seven months after Saturday Night Wrist was released, and continued writing throughout the remainder of the year. During their tour with The Fall of Troy, Deftones set up a room backstage each night to jam together as a whole band.[10] Chino Moreno, Billboard[6] In October 2007, Deftones returned to their home in California and revamped their studio, The Spot. According to Carpenter, the studio became more of a clubhouse or "treehouse with a studio in it."[4][11] The band built a bar in the studio and would go there to drink, play cards and hangout before picking up their instruments each day.[4] Deftones used their pre-production time as therapy to vent about their lives in a positive environment. Several members were going through divorces at this time, going through custody battles over their children, money issues and other problems.[4][12] By the end of October, Deftones had half of an album written and continued to write throughout the rest of 2007 with intentions to self-produce the material in the following year.[7] The working title of "Eros" was announced in January 2008.[13] The tentative title stems from an inside joke between the band members. Drummer Abe Cunningham stated that while touring Germany, "There'd always be some sort of German porn, and they would always say [in heavy, lust accent], 'Eros.' it was just kind of funny, and it's been a joke for years."[3] Deftones officially entered the studio on April 14, 2008[14] with producer Terry Date and engineer Scott Olson. Deftones worked with Terry Date on their first four studio albums, from 1995's Adrenaline through 2003's Deftones. The band created a blog specifically to update fans on the progress of recording, the first time in the group's history.[15] In September 2008, Deftones started performing the new song "Melanie" during live performances.[16] Around this time Terry Date had begun mixing some of the songs at his home studio in Seattle, Washington.[17][18] They had also planned on releasing one video of studio updates online per week leading up to the album's release, but only released five before production was put on hold.[19] Bassist Chi Cheng was on his way home returning from his brother's memorial service on November 3, 2008 when he was involved in a serious car accident.[20] Chino Moreno had just left the studio after recording his vocal tracks for Eros, and was about half-way done with all songs on the album when the accident occurred.[4] Cheng was rushed to the ICU and was later announced to be in a coma. All production on the album halted, and the main focus of the band members was on Cheng's condition. With production on Eros still on hold, Deftones recruited former Quicksand bassist Sergio Vega to fill in for various festival shows and also fundraising concerts for Cheng's hospital bills in early 2009. Vega had previously filled during 1999 tours after Cheng underwent foot surgery. In July 2009, Deftones announced they had indefinitely shelved Eros in favor of work on a new album written with Vega.[21] Their decision to temporarily scrap the album and start over was a "purely creative" choice, and had nothing to do with the condition of the bassist. Instead of finishing what they had started and releasing the nearly complete Eros, which was described as a dark album, Deftones wanted to write an optimistic and uplifting album to help cope with their situation with Cheng.[22] The band used the same method of writing music as a group and avoiding Pro Tools that was used with the writing and recording of Eros.[22] The new album, titled Diamond Eyes, was released on May 4, 2010. Deftones supported this release throughout 2010 and 2011 with international tours, singles and music videos for the songs "Diamond Eyes," "Rocket Skates," "Sextape," "You've Seen the Butcher," and "Beauty School." With Eros still shelved, Deftones expect to write a second album with Vega during mid-to-late 2011 and release it in early 2012.[23] Eros saw several tentative release dates before it was shelved indefinitely. When the band started writing the album in 2007, Eros was expected for a late 2008 release.[7][24] As late 2008 began to approach, the tentative release date was pushed back to early 2009; or simply "winter" as seen in the teaser studio videos.[25] After Cheng's car accident, it was uncertain if the album would ever get released. But after Deftones began started playing shows in early 2009, a new tentative release date of October 2009 was announced.[26] However, Deftones started writing new music with Sergio Vega, and in June 2009 the band made the creative decision to hold off with releasing Eros indefinitely in favor a new album later to be known as Diamond Eyes.[21] The band still hopes to release Eros at some point down the road, but a specific or tentative date is unknown. As of 2011[dated info], there is no estimated release date for the album. Feeling that the album is attached to the tragedy surrounding Chi Cheng, the group would like to wait until enough time has passed for the songs to stand on their own merits.[27] Deftones would also ideally like for Cheng to come out of his comatose state before it gets released.[28] According to Moreno: Chino Moreno, MyYearbook interview[29] Contrasting to the lighter and more atmospheric sound of Saturday Night Wrist, Eros was expected to be a heavier album. In 2008, prior to recording, the album had been described as the band's "most unorthodox piece of work" containing "that good old 'Fuck you, I hope you die!' aggression."[14] On previous Deftones records, Moreno wrote some of the guitar parts with Stephen Carpenter; but Moreno stepped down from guitars to focus solely on vocals and lyrics, giving Carpenter full creative control over guitar composition.[7] Whereas Moreno writes slower more mid-tempo songs, Stephen Carpenter writes "snappier" more up-tempo songs.[7] The songs he wrote for Eros were described as "energetic" and "dance-y."[7] The album was also later described as a very dark and experimental album that pushed the each member's creative boundary.[22] Comparisons were drawn between the more experimental tracks and Pink Floyd's "lengthy spaced-out songs, psychedelic vibes and plenty of jamming" by Revolver.[4] The song "Dallas" was specifically compared to the "big sounding, real mid-tempo" song "Minerva" from Deftones' self-titled album.[4] In a 2010 interview with Sergio Vega, he described the Eros material as longer and more complex than the songs recorded for Diamond Eyes.[27] The working titles of all songs from the Eros sessions were named after strippers.[3] Deftones Production and recording
