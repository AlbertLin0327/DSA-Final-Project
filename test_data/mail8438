Steve Wright in the Afternoon is the name of the current afternoon show on BBC Radio 2, hosted by Steve Wright. The show is one of the most popular on the station, and is often referred to as The Big Show. The show is broadcast from 14:00 until 17:00 Monday to Friday. The show originally started on Radio 1 in the 1980s where it ran successfully for a number of years until ending in the early 1990s. Steve Wright then worked on other shows for the network until moving to Radio 2 in 1996. He started as a weekend presenter hosting a Saturday morning show (later taken over by Jonathan Ross) and Sunday morning's Steve Wright's Sunday Love Songs. Steve Wright in the Afternoon was revived in 1999 following a shake-up at Radio 2 and Wright now presents the show every Monday to Friday from 2:00pm to 5:00pm. It has built up a huge following[citation needed] and was given its own podcast in 2006 as part of a trial period. This is still available every week with highlights from the show. The Show follows the zoo format, with Steve Wright as the host, and co-presenters Tim Smith and Janey Lee Grace, as well as input from news and travel presenters on the day. There is also the character 'The Old Woman'. No one knows her identity, and there are many rumours circulating on the internet as to her true identity. Other spoof characters include 'Barry from Watford' (the octogenarian lifestyle coach - played by the actor Alex Lowe) and 'Elvis', who appears in the feature Ask Elvis. The show begins at 14:00 with the show's main theme. Unlike most shows, it is well established as being a "brand", with its own unique style of presentation, although Steve regularly uses the standard BBC Radio 2 jingles along with jingles unique to the show, written and performed by AJ Music Productions.[1] Guests regularly appear on the show, often to plug a new TV show or movie. There are no stand-in presenters for Steve Wright in the Afternoon per se, as the name and format is unique to Steve Wright and the show's production crew. Because of this, when Steve is not hosting the show, the stand-in host does very much their own thing, rather than replicating the normal show. The main theme and unique jingles are not played, and otherwise regular features (such as the factoids) are not present. In the past, stand in presenters have included Mark Radcliffe, Aled Jones, Craig Charles, Liza Tarbuck, Dale Winton, Richard Allinson and Patrick Kielty. More recently, the regular stand-in host has been Chris Tarrant. Some regular features include; This is along with entertainment news, music and chat, and news on the hour
