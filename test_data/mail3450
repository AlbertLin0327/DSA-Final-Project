The Devereaux House in Salt Lake City, Utah, also known as the Staines-Jennings Mansion, was built in 1857. It was designed by William Paul. It was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1971.[1] The grand house and its large yard have been preserved in the middle of the city without even resorting to a perimeter fence, so the yard has the appearance of a park. The house is surrounded by larger and newer structures including EnergySolutions Arena, the Triad Center, and the Salt Lake City Union Pacific Station and the surrounding Gateway District development.
