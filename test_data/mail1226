Crushed Butler were a British protopunk/hard rock band that existed between 1969 and 1971. According to 2008's Pretty Vacant: A History of UK Punk, the band "was, in many ways, Britain's first proto-punk band."[1] Band members went on to form Darryl Read's Beat Existentialists, The Gorillas and to pursue solo careers. Crushed Butler formed in 1969 with a line-up of Jesse Hector (guitar, vocals), Alan Butler (bass guitar) and Darryl Read (drums).[2] They initially played cover versions of other bands' songs, before writing their own original material.[3][4] In early 1971, the band changed their name to Tiger, and the line-up also changed to include Barry Wyles, formerly a member of an early version of Queen.[5] As Tiger they were managed by Neil Christian of The Crusaders, and Arthur Anderson joined the band on bass guitar. However, they still were unable to secure a record deal and the band split up in late 1971 when Read took up a job as a songwriter at Track Records.[2] Hector and Butler continued as Helter-Skelter and went on to form The Hammersmith Gorillas (later shortened to The Gorillas), while Read pursued a solo career, as well as working as an actor. Read's works have included three albums (Beat Existentialist (1991) and Freshly Dug (1999) with Ray Manzarek and Bleeding Paradise in 2007.[6] In 2000, Read starred alongside Jamie Foreman and Zoot Money in the feature film Remember a Day playing the leading role of Roger Bannerman, a reclusive rock star. He currently performs rock concerts with his group Beat Existentialists in Europe and the USA. His later literary works works have included a biographical novel, Stardom Road and SET, a collection of selected poetry works illustrated by George Underwood. Crushed Butler's recordings were eventually released in 1998 by Dig The Fuzz Records on the Uncrushed album.[2]
