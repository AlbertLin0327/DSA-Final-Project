Papeln con limn is a refreshing Venezuelan beverage made with papeln (raw hardened sugar cane pulp), water, and usually lime or sometimes lemon juice. It is usually served during the hottest hours of the day, and commonly offered with traditional Venezuelan food, such as arepas, cachapas or hervidos (rich chicken or beef stew). 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
