Fist of the Blue Sky (, Sten no Ken?, Souten no Ken) is a martial arts/noir manga series by Tetsuo Hara with plot supervision by Buronson that was serialized in the Weekly Comic Bunch from 2001 throughout 2010. It is a prequel to Fist of the North Star, which Hara originally illustrated and co-wrote with Buronson. Set primarily in Shanghai during the 1930s, the series centers around the 62nd successor of the Hokuto Shinken style, Kenshiro Kasumi, the namesake and predecessor of Kenshiro from Fist of the North Star. It has been adapted into a 26-episode anime series that aired from 2006 to 2007. The main protagonist of this story is Kasumi Kenshiro, better known as "Yan Wang" or "The King of Hell" (derived from the myth Yan Luo Wang). Kasumi is a laid back and chain-smoking Tokyo professor who is secretly the successor of the deadly Chinese assassin martial art Hokuto Shinken who travels to Shanghai after hearing the news of his Triad friend Pan Guang-Lin and his sister Yu-Ling (Kasumi's love interest) are in trouble. In Shanghai, Kasumi has to fight the three Hokuto families, the Hokuto Sankaken (based on the royal families of Romance of the Three Kingdoms). At the same time Kasumi has to help Pan's "Qing Bang" Triad gang against the immoral "Hong-Hua" Triads in gaining territory and influence in Shanghai. "North Dipper Divine Fist" (, Pinyin: Bidu Shnqun). Called "God Fist of the North Star" in the Raijin Comics translation. "North Dipper Sn Family Fist" (, Pinyin: Bidu Snjiqun), which specializes in Ki manipulation. The school also has a forbidden technique that displaces ones pressure points by altering ones own Ki and blood flow, but also shortens the user's lifespan. "North Dipper Co Family Fist" (, Pinyin: Bidu Cojiqun) "North Dipper Li Family Fist" (, Pinyin: Bidu Lijiqun). Same style as Hokuto Ryken (, lit. "North Dipper Lapis Lazuli Fist") from Fist of the North Star. According to Hokuto law, when there are no male successors for Hokuto Shinken, a student of the Rykaken style can be chosen to be the next successor. "Pole Cross Sacred Fist" (, Pinyin: Jshz Shngqun), an offshoot of Hokuto Rykaken. A relatively new style compared to the Hokuto styles, its astrological symbol is the constellation of the Southern Cross and uses stabbing techniques that destroys the body externally. It's assumed to be the precursor to the Nanto Seiken styles. "West Dipper Lunar Fist" (, Pinyin: Xdu Yuqun). A martial art of the Yuezhi people. Shuken studied this martial art and blended it with his Hokuto Ske no Ken (, lit. "North Dipper Lineage's Fist") to create Hokuto Shinken. Seito Gekken uses the Keiraku Hik, the same vital points used by Hokuto Shinken, to cause destruction, but does so through puncturing instead of pressure. Qng Bng (, Chinpan?) is the Shanghai "Green Gang". Shanghai's evil "Red Flower Gang" (, Kkakai?). Most of them were maimed in some way by Kenshiro during a previous visit to Shanghai prior to the start of the series. Based on the real life Shanghai Red Gang ( Hng Bng). Many of the plot points mentioned in the comic contain real historical facts, such as how Shanghai was controlled by the foreign concessions (the story focus mainly on the French settlement) during the 1930s. Also seen are Jewish refugees who escaped from Nazi persecution in Europe, and the invasion of China by the Japanese Army. Chiang Kai Shek and some historical Kuomintang figures appear in the story as well. Tetsuo Hara wanted the fights in the manga to look more like traditional Chinese martial arts, so the action is somewhat faster and more detailed than those in Fist of the North Star. Hara went to Shanghai in person to get his inspiration. Tetsuo Hara describes the protagonist Kenshiro Kasumi as a combination of the strength of Kenshiro, the good nature of Keiji Maeda from Hana no Keiji and the sarcastic attitude of the title character of Nakabo Rintaro. Fist of the Blue Sky has been in serialization in the Weekly Comic Bunch since the magazine's first issue, published with the cover date of May 29, 2001.[1] New chapters of Sten no Ken are published irregularly in the magazine. The manga concluded in 2010 with the final issue of Comic Bunch, lasting a total of 22 volumes. An English version of Fist of the Blue Sky was serialized in the now-defunct manga anthology Raijin Comics published by Gutsoon! Entertainment from 2002 to 2004. Four collected volumes were published by Gutsoon under the Raijin Graphic Novels imprint before the company went out of business and ceased publication of all their titles. A weekly anime series based on Sten no Ken aired on Japan's TV Asahi on Thursdays at 2:40am from October 4, 2006 to March 14, 2007. The series lasted only 26 episodes, but four of the episodes (16-18, and 21) did not air during the original run. The complete series has been released on DVD in Region 2 format by Universal Entertainment Japan, including unaired episodes and uncensored content. The series adapts the storyline from the beginning and up to vol. 8.
