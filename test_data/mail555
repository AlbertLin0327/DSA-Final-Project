1RJA, 2KGT Tyrosine-protein kinase 6 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the PTK6 gene.[2][3][4] Tyrosine-protein kinase 6 (also known as Breast Tumor Kinase, Brk) is a cytoplasmic non-receptor protein kinase which may function as an intracellular signal transducer in epithelial tissues. The encoded protein has been shown to undergo autophosphorylation.[4] Overexpression of this gene in mammary epithelial cells leads to sensitization of the cells to epidermal growth factor and results in a partially transformed phenotype. Expression of this gene has been detected at low levels in some breast tumors but not in normal breast tissue.[4] PTK6 has been shown to interact with STAP2[5] and KHDRBS1.[6]
