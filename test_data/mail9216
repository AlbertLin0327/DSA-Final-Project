St. Thomas established seven and half churches during his stay in India (Kerala) namely the church in Kodungalloor, Paravur, Palayoor, Kokkamangalam, Niranam, Chayal(NILACKAL) and Kollam. Thiruvithamkode (Thiruvamkode) in Kanyakumari district of Tamilnadu is accorded the status of a half church. The people and other valuable source reveal that St. Thomas arrived and built a church here, but due to the huge numbers of flying cockroach, the missionaries abandoned the place. Hence the Church construction was half done. It is a tourist destination with accommodation facilities. Owing to the difficulties in transportation and wildlife scare prior appointments is compulsory. The church is situated in the Hills and needs a long walk from the village through the Forest-Cum-Roads. There is a watchman always in the premises. Beware of the wild elephants that patrol these areas frequently. The highlight of the Church is the old Cross that is believed to be carried by the Saint himself. The cross is framed in a glass wooden frame. Govt. PHC, Chaithanya Hospital, Cosmo Hospital, Sabitha Medicals.
