Gate of the Orient (simplified Chinese: ; traditional Chinese: ; pinyin: dng fng zh mn) is the name of a 301.8 metre high skyscraper in the Chinese city Suzhou currently under construction. The building is located in Suzhou Industrial Park and to the west of Jinji Lake. The skyscraper has a very distinct form, at the base it consists of two towers that come together at the top to form an arch (or a gate). The 68 storey building is due to be completed by the end of 2012.
