Franklinton High School is located at 3 North Main Street in Franklinton, North Carolina. The school was built in 1923 to house all grade levels, replacing the older Franklinton Graded School on the north end of town. It was a gift to the Town of Franklinton from Samuel C. Vann, founder and original owner of the historic Sterling Cotton Mill which is also located in Franklinton. The main building is three stories. When built, the first floor was used as the elementary school, the second was the middle school, and the third was used as the high school. The school should be replaced by the new Franklinton High School which is under construction and is scheduled to hold its first classes 2011-12 school year with a capacity of 1,200 students Franklinton High School; Town of Franklinton (1992).
