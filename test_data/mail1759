Things Are What They Used to Be is the third full-length studio album by British alternative rock / electronica band Zoot Woman. The album spawned five singles, videos were created for "We Won't Break," "Memory" and "Saturation."  Things Are What They Used To Be was met with positive, yet mixed reviews. While Neil Condron from Clash magazine argued that "they've reworked their own template," others claimed the exact opposite, for example Tom Hocknell from BBC Music, who said that their music "remains platitudinal electro."
