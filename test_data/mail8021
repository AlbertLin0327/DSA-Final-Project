The European Beer Star is one of the most important beer competitions worldwide[citation needed], in 2011 it will take part for the eighth time. Consideration is given to types of beer which have their origins in Europe. All breweries can participate: Local, Regional, National and worldwide operating breweries, not only from Europe but also from all countries all over the world. The European Beer Star Award is solely concerned with those somewhat special, authentic beers. Prizes are awarded to the beers which best fulfill the respective type criteria, and whose taste and quality impresses the most. This award has been initiated by the associations Private Brauereien Deutschland, Private Brauereien Bayern and SIB - the association of small and independent breweries of Europe. The tasting is carried out by an expert-jury, which is a top-class, independent committee of renowned and experienced beer experts from across the world. The yardstick is not the technical laboratory analysis, but a rating from the consumer's viewpoint with all the senses. Key test criteria are exclusively those of sense and taste. The aim of the blind tasting is to find the beers, which best fulfill the type criteria of each category and whose taste as well as quality are the most convincing. In each category, the three best beers are awarded a gold, silver and bronze medal. Less than three prizes will be awarded if there are no three beers which meet the specified quality and category standards. Yet consumers who appreciate a good quality, fine tasting beer also have more than a word to say in the European Beer Star Award. Lastly it is them who vote for the Consumers' Favourite, an extra prize. Visitors to Brau Beviale, one of the most important trade fairs for the international beverage industry, held in Nuremberg, will have the opportunity to cast their vote which beer they prefer. From amongst the gold-medal winners it is they that choose the ultimate in product quality.
