The Farmer Baronetcy, of Mount Pleasant in the County of Sussex, was a title in the Baronetage of Great Britain. It was created on 19 January 1780 for George Farmer, in honour of his late father, Captain George Farmer, who was killed when commanding HMSQuebec in a naval battle with superior French forces off Ushant. The title became extinct on the death of the fifth Baronet in 1913.
