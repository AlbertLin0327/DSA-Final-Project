The 1996 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXVI Olympiad, were a summer multi-sport event held in Atlanta, Georgia, United States from 19 July to 4 August 1996. The 1996 Olympics are often considered the largest in history,[1] with a total of 10,318athletes from 197National Olympic Committees (NOCs), competing in 271events in 26sports.[2][3] Athletes from 79NOCs won at least one medal, leaving 118countries without a medal.[2] The United States won the most gold medals (44), as well as the most medals overall (101).[2][4] It also won its first medal in a women's' team sport,[5] the victorious gymnastics team later being referred to as the Magnificent Seven. Donovan Bailey of Canada set a world record in the men's 100m race (9.84 seconds). Michael Johnson of the United States also set a world record in the 200m race (19.32 seconds)[2] and Naim Suleymanoglu from Turkey also set the record of three consecutive Olympic titles in weightlifting.[6] Nigeria won its first individual olympic gold medal at the olympics in the women's long jump event. They also won the gold medal in men's soccer, defeating more fancied sides like Brazil and Argentina. Armenia, Belarus, The Czech Republic, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Slovakia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan were represented for the first time at a Summer Games. Of these, only Kyrgyzstan did not receive any medals.[4] The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC)[2] and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals won by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. Medals won in team competitions are counted only once, no matter how many athletes won medals as part of the team.[7] Host country (United States)
