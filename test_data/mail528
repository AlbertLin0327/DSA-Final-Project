Huntington Stadium (formerly Ryedale Stadium) is the stadium of English rugby league team York City Knights. The stadium was completed in October 1989 by contractors Birse Construction Ltd. It is situated two miles north of the city centre at Monk's Cross, close to the A1036 Malton Road. The stadium was financed by Ryedale District Council and was named the Ryedale Stadium. Huntington Stadium's record attendance for a rugby league match was set on 5 January 1990 when 4,977 turned up to watch a Division 2 match against Halifax. In 2011 the University of York will face Lancaster University in a first team rugby match, the first time the two sides have met in such surroundings. The game is part of the annual Roses sporting competition between the two universities. The stadium has a capacity of 3,428. Its facilities include a seated Main Stand incorporating executive boxes to the rear, a Popular Stand, floodlights, an electronic scoreboard and an athletics track. The stadium also has a large multi purpose sports hall, a fitness room and superb social facilities, including the Galtres Bar, which is open to season ticket holders on match days. However, Huntington Sports and Social Club is now in use as a pre-match venue for any fans attending games. There are 180 car park spaces available to the home and opposition supporters on match days. This match day car park is located at the end of the main Courtneys/Waterworld car park and costs 3. It has long been proposed that the Knights should share a new municipal stadium with York City F.C. and it was announced in July 2010 that the preferred location would be the site of the current Huntington Stadium.[1]
