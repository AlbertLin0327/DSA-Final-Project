Terence "Terry" John Cobner (born 10 January 1946)[1] is a former Welsh international rugby union player and British Lion. He was born in Blaenavon, Monmouthshire and currently lives in Pontypool. A back row forward, or flanker, he scored a try on his debut against Scotland in 1974 at the age of 28, and went onto gain a total of 19 caps for Wales and score a total of two tries, the second coming against France in 1975. Cobner also captained Wales against Australia in his final appearances in 1978. He toured with the British Lions in 1977 to New Zealand where he played in three of the four tests, and virtually took over as captain of the tour from Phil Bennett in its latter stages. He played his club rugby for Pontypool RFC from 1968 till 1981 and was captain of the side for 10 consecutive seasons from 1970 to 1979.
