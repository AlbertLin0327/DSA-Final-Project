Joel Allen Barber (January 17, 1809  June 17, 1881) was a U.S. Representative from Wisconsin.[1] Barber was born in the town of Georgia, Vermont, in Franklin County. After graduating from the Georgia Academy he attended the University of Vermont in Burlington, where he studied law. Upon graduation, Barber read law with George P. Marsh. He was admitted to the bar in 1834 in Prince Georges County, Maryland, where he was teaching school, and commenced practice in Fairfield, Vermont. Barber moved to Wisconsin in 1837, settling in Lancaster, where he continued to practice law. He served as county clerk for Grant County, for four years and as district attorney for three terms. He served as member of the first constitutional convention of Wisconsin in 1846. Barber was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1852, 1853, 1863, and 1864, serving as speaker in 1864. He served as member of the Wisconsin State Senate in 1856 and 1857. After establishing a law partnership with George Clementson in 1869, Barber was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Republican, serving in the Forty-second and Forty-third Congresses from March 4, 1871 to March 3, 1875.
