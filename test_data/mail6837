Diarra Traor (19351985) was a Guinean soldier and politician. He served as Prime Minister of Guinea from 1984 to 1985 as a member of a junta led by Lansana Cont. In 1985, after an attempted coup d'tat against him, Cont had Traor executed. At the death of Guinea's President Ahmed Skou Tour in March 1984, Traor was a colonel in Guinea's army.[1][2][3] On 3 April 1984, Traor supported a coup d'tat led by Lieutenant Colonel Lansana Cont.[4] The coup ousted interim President Louis Lansana Beavogui and dismantled the regime of the Democratic Party of Guinea. Cont made himself President, and he appointed Traor to be the Prime Minister. Cont, Traor, and others governed as a juntathe Military Committee of National Recovery (CMRN).[5] By July 1985, Cont had demoted Traor to Minister of State for National Education.[6][7][8] On 4 July 1985, soldiers loyal to Cont, who was attending a summit in Togo, thwarted a coup d'tat. Cont, a member of the Susu people (or Sousou), used the opportunity to eliminate rival soldiers from the Malink ethnic group, including Traor.[7] Cont's forces swiftly captured Traor, and showed him on television being brutally assaulted.[7] Cont's forces promptly executed Traor and approximately one hundred other military personnel, many of whom were Malink.[5][7][9][10]
