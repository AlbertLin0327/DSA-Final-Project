Reigate (play/raet/) is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. The constituency is located in Surrey, bordering with Greater London. It is centered on the town of Reigate from which it takes its name. The Boundary Commission boundary review prior to the 2010 general election moved the Preston ward from Epsom and Ewell into the Reigate constituency to increase the population of the seat which was the smallest in Surrey. At the public consultation stage of the boundary review there were a number of petitions for the constituency to be renamed Reigate and Banstead to bring it in line with the district, including ones from both the local MP and the borough council. However, the review rejected these petitions since it felt that that constituencies should be renamed only when they had undergone substantial boundary changes that render the existing name implausible, that the constituency contains only 70% of the district, that the seat is centred on Reigate but Banstead is in the extreme northeast corner, that other towns such as Redhill might have as much if not greater claim to be in the name, and that Banstead has a history of being moved between seats (it was in Epsom and Ewell prior to 1997) and may be moved again. This constituency was first created with the first election of Burgesses to Parliament in 1295, electing two members. It continued to elect two members until 1832 when its representation was reduced to one member by the Great Reform Act. In 1868 the constituency was disenfranchised for corruption, but was revived in 1885 by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 when the East Surrey constituency was abolished and broken up. In 1974, the seat saw major boundary changes which moved much of Eastern Surrey into the radically redesigned East Surrey seat and added the Banstead area to the seat. This constituency underwent boundary changes between the 1992 and 1997 general elections and thus change in share of vote is based on a notional calculation. George Gardiner changed party from the Conservative Party to the Referendum following his deselection by the local Conservative association.
