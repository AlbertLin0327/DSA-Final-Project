Pic Nic railway station, alternatively Pic-Nic[1] or Picnic, was a railway station in Melbourne, Australia. It was located on the Hawthorn line (now the Alamein, Belgrave and Lilydale lines) on the Melbourne side of the Hawthorn Railway Bridge bridge,[2][3] between Church Street (now East Richmond) and Hawthorn stations. The line to the station was opened by the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company on 24 September 1860, and extended to Hawthorn in 1861 with the completion of the Hawthorn Railway Bridge across the Yarra River. The station closed on 19 July 1898. Coordinates: 374937S 145056E / 37.82694S 145.01556E / -37.82694; 145.01556
