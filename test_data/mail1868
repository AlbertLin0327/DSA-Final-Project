The Ghana Road Network is maintained by the Ghana Highway Authority, which was established in 1974 to develop the country's trunk road network totaling 13,367km. This makes up 33% of Ghana's total road network of 40,186km[1]. The road system consists of National roads, Regional roads, and Inter-Regional roads, all of which link major popular centers in Ghana. National Roads in Ghana are trunk roads, forming the major routes between major urban centers. Essentially, they are the backbone of the backbone of the Ghana road network. This category of roads is designated with the letter N followed by a number indicating the specific route[2]. Odd-numbered routes run east to west, while even-numbered routes run north to south. Regional roads, designated with the letter R, are a mix of primary and secondary routes that link major settlements. They also serve as feeder routes to National Roads. Major Regional roads are indicated by an R followed by a two-digit number, and minor Regional roads are indicated by an R followed by a three-digit number. Inter-Regional roads, designated with the prefix IR, connect major settlements and regional capitals across regional borders. Running east to west are odd-numbered routes, while north-south routes are even-numbered.
