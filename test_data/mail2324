German submarine U-20 was a Type IIB U-boat of the Nazi German Kriegsmarine. Her keel was laid down August 1 1935, by Germaniawerft of Kiel. She was commissioned on 1 February 1936. During World War II, she conducted operations against enemy shipping. U-20 went on 17 war patrols, sinking 16 ships totalling 39,637 tons and damaging one more of 1,846 tons. To serve in the 30th U-boat Flotilla, she was transported overland and on the Danube to the Black Sea. On 26 June 1943, U-20 was attacked with depth charges in the Black Sea by a convoy escort. The damage was such that she had to return to base. She was scuttled on 10 September 1944, in the Black Sea off the coast of Turkey.[2] On 3 February 2008, The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that U-20 had been discovered by Seluk Kolay, a Turkish marine engineer, in 80 feet (24m) of water off the coast of the Turkish city of Zonguldak.[3]  Coordinates: 4110N 3047E / 41.167N 30.783E / 41.167; 30.783
