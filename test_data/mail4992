Calgary General Hospital was the name given to a series of medical facilities in the city of Calgary. Calgary General Hospital #4 became the oldest hospital located in the city of Calgary by the time of its demolition in 1998. The facility was known in its later history as the Bow Valley Centre of the Calgary General Hospital after it was merged with the Peter Lougheed Centre, developing into a 960-bed hospital providing a wide array of in-patient and out-patient services.[2] The facility was located in the community of Bridgeland in northeast Calgary, situated minutes away from Calgary City Centre. The Calgary General Hospital was demolished as a result of provincial government policy in the mid-1990s, and its services transferred to the nearby Peter Lougheed Centre.[2] The demolition was controversial in the wake of continued health care demands in Calgary. Proponents of the demolition argued that the facility was aged and unable to provide efficient service for the money required to operate it, "(b)ut the decision left Calgary without an emergency department downtown and destroyed a "state of the art" facility that would (10 years later) be very much in demand". [3] The hospital building was demolished by implosion of October 4, 1998.[4] Coordinates: 510317N 1140246W / 51.05472N 114.04611W / 51.05472; -114.04611 (Bow Valley Centre of the Calgary General Hospital)
