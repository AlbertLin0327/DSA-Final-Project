The War Is Making You Poor Act (H.R. 5353), introduced by Rep. Alan Grayson on May 20th, 2010, is a bill which aims to cut separate funding for the Iraq War and Afghanistan War, and use the proceeds to eliminate federal income taxes on every American's first $35,000 of income. The bill has garnered the support of 18 co-sponsors in congress including Ron Paul (R-TX), Walter Jones (R-NC), John Conyers (D-MI), Lynn Woolsey (D-CA) and Dennis Kucinich (D-OH).[1][2] Only $159.3 billion in war spending would be affected; the $548.9 billion base war budget would remain in place, as would the approximately $75 billion black budget.[3]
