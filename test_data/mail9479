The Khatril are a tribe found in Pakistan, almost exclusively in Rawalpindi District. They were included among the Dhund Abbasi in the 1921 census. According to the 1911 Census of India, they were located mainly in Gujar Khan Tehsil and were classified as Jats. According to some sources Khatrils claims descent from Manaf, and as such claim to belong to the famous Abbasi family, as do the neighbouring tribes, such as Dhund Abbasi and Jasgam.[1] They also claim that the land they now occupy was under Gakhar rule, therefore they represent themselves as Dhunds. They did not join the Dhund Abbasi in their attempted raid on Murree in 1857 and in physical appearance they resemble the Satti people. Historically they intermarried both with the Jasgams and Dhund Abbasi's. [1] They are found mainly in Gujar Khan Tehsil, especially around the town of and Mandrah. Mohri Khatril, Dhok Khatril and Dulmi Khatril in Rawalpindi District are important villages of the clan.
