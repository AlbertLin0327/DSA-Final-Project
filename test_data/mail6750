Cabarita Ferry Wharf is the commuter wharf serving the suburb of Cabarita in Sydney Australia. It is part of the Sydney Ferries network. It is located on the Rydalmere ferry route travelling between Rydalmere and Circular Quay ferry wharves. The wharf has a single jetty used for docking of RiverCat ferries. As of 2011, it is the busiest and fastest growing wharf on the river.[1] Wharf 1 Cabarita Ferry Wharf is also served by buses. The adjoining bus stop is served by route 466 which runs between the wharf and Ashfield Railway Station via Burwood Railway Station, Enfield and Croydon Park. The bus connection and route replaced a tram service which closed in 1954.[2] Coordinates: 335027.49S 151659.32E / 33.8409694S 151.1164778E / -33.8409694; 151.1164778
