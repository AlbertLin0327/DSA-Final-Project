The British (Open) Tag Team Championship is the top tag team championship contested for throughout the British wrestling circuit. It is currently being contested for in Brian Dixon's All Star Promotions. Many versions of the British Tag Team Titles exist in the independent circuit of the United Kingdom at any given time but the scene is usually dominated by one companies version. When another company becomes dominant the title often manages to unify itself or is brought into that company. "Chippendale" Mikey Whiplash and new partner, Robbie Dynamite defeated the UK Dream Team (Kid Cool and Dean "2 Xtreme" Allmark) on 25 February 2006 in Staffordshire to win the titles and were defended as recently as April 2009.
