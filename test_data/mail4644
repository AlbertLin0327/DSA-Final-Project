Change! is the second full-length album by the Black Swans. It is a follow up to 2004's Who Will Walk in the Darkness with You? and their 2006 EP, Sex Brain. Harp Magazine described the album as a tip of the hat to Charles Simic, the Left Banke, and Fred Neil.[3] The cover of the CD release is a painting, "Untitled", by Debbie Porchetti, a member of Arc Industries North Workshop, a branch of Franklin County Board of MRDD. The workshop provides services to 300 adults with developmental challenges and recognize their talents by offering an environment that reinforces their confidence and self expression. Change! was also released in a limited edition vinyl featuring original, one of a kind artwork by workshop members who applied their expression to 500 blank album sleves.[3][4] All songs written and composed by Jerry DeCicca, except "Blue Moon #9" by DeCicca, Faulkner & Forbes.
