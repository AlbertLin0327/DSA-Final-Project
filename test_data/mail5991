Vellayambalam is a prominent junction in the city of Thiruvananthapuram and is situated on the Rajapatha (Royal Path) that stretches from Kowdiar to East Fort. This junction is in the state of Kerala, India. It connects the arterial roads connecting Kowdiar, Sasthamangalam, East Fort, Thycaud and Thampanoor.

The road leads from Kowdiar Square to the Fine Arts college, Vellayambalam. Museum and Rama Rao Lamp was considered during early 1930s and Charalkonna (Copper Pod tree, or Peltophorzion Pterocarpium) brought from Sri Lanka was planted as avenue trees. Before the widening, the Vellayambalam junction was a tiny place, where four narrow roads met. A Wayside Inn (Vazhiambalam) of the revenue department occupied the south east corner of that junction at the foot of the diamond hill. As the Maharajah often passed through that junction, the inn was kept clean and whitewashed. Because of that white wayside inn (Vella Vazhi Ambalam ) that junction came to be known as  Vellayambalam (shortened form of Vella Vazhi Ambalam) and in due course the locality around was also named Vellayambalam.
