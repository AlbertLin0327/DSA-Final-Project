David L. Lindsey is an American novelist, working primarily in the mystery and crime fiction genres. He has published fourteen novels in a writing career spanning 29 years. Lindsey was born in Kingsville, Texas in 1944. [1] He spent his childhood in the Texas Rio Grande Valley and in West Texas, near San Angelo. Lindsey graduated from North Texas State University with a degree in English literature. Lindsey moved to Austin, Texas in 1970 and has lived there ever since. During the 1970s, Lindsey worked as a book editor at a number of small publishing houses in Austin. At one point he operated his own publishing firm, Heidelberg Publishers. [2] During his years in publishing, Lindsey had an interest in writing, but felt it would be fiscally "irresponsible". [3] Finally, in 1980 his wife urged him to "go for it".[2] Lindsey decided to write mystery fiction because of its general marketability.[2][3] His first two novels appeared in 1983: Black Gold, Red Death and A Cold Mind. The latter work introduced Houston homicide detective Stuart Haydon, a cultured, independently wealthy protagonist who would appear in four subsequent novels. By 1994 Lindsey had over two million books in print.[2] By 2004, his novels had been translated into 20 languages.[3] His 1990 novel Mercy was adapted into a movie of the same name in 2000.
