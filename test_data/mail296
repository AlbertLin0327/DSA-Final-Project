Helmdon was a railway station serving the village of Helmdon in Northamptonshire on the former Great Central main line (GCR). The GCR main line was the last main line to be constructed from the north of England to London[1] and opened for passenger services on 15 March 1899 (goods services beginning in April).[2] The station, originally named Helmdon, opened with the line on 15 March 1899.[3] From the station the line continued northwards on an embankment before crossing the valley on the nine arch Helmdon Viaduct[4] over the River Tove. In 1928 the station was renamed Helmdon for Sulgrave,[3] to indicate its proximity to Sulgrave Manor. The station was closed to passengers on 4 March 1963,[3] and to goods on 2 November 1964.[5] Demolition occurred in 1966.[6] [update]The viaduct remains, having seen its last train more than 40 years ago.
