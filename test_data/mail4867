Sarah Groff (born November 27, 1981[1]) is an American athlete who competes in triathlon. She will represent the United States in triathlon at the 2012 Summer Olympics after a qualifying seventh place finish at the World Championship Series race in London.[2] Groff is the winner of the 2007 ITU Aquathlon World Championships.[3] Groff competed in cross country and swimming in high school at Cooperstown High School and Deerfield Academy.[1] After spending a year in Valencia, Spain, Groff went on to attend Middlebury College where she was a member of the swim team and competed in middle distance and distance freestyle events. Groff was named to the All-NESCAC and All-American teams for her accomplishments.[4] After graduating, Groff found it difficult to choose between swimming and running for her future athletic pursuits. After having some success in some amateur triathlon competitions she decided to pursue the sport of triathlon further.[5] Groff began her International Triathlon Union (ITU) racing in 2005, competing in various World Cup and Pan American Cup races.[6] In 2007, Groff had her first notable finish, winning the 2007 ITU Aquathlon World Championships.[3] That same year she placed 4th at the ITU World Cup race in Edmonton and was a member of the runner-up USA squad at the ITU World Team Championship. The following year, with coach Siri Lindley, she placed 2nd at the 2008 World Cup race in Huatulco and placed 7th at the ITU World Championship in Vancouver. At the first 2008 USA Triathlon Olympic Trials in Tuscaloosa, Groff placed third, and at the end of the year she finished as the top American woman and 4th overall in the ITU World Cup season series.[7] In 2009, Groff had three top 10 finishes in ITU racing, including 9th place finishes in the newly revamped World Championship Series (WCS) events in Madrid and Washington, D.C. She was the 2nd ranking American woman in the WCS series.[6][7] In 2010, she joined up with coach Darren Smith and would go on to take 12th at London, 10th at Kitzbhel and 8th at Hamburg in WCS racing events.[6][7] She also took 2nd at the USA Triathlon Elite Championship and 5th at the US Open Toyota Cup finale in Dallas.[7] For 2011, Groff was third at the 2011 WCS race in Kitzbhel, achieving the first-ever podium finish for a U.S. woman. A month later, she would place 7th in London, a designated World Qualification Event for the 2012 Olympics, putting her on the American Olympic team with second place finisher Gwen Jorgensen.[2] Her performances for the entire 2011 WCS series earned her an overall third place finish in the World Championships Series standings,[8] the best showing by an American triathlete in the three year history of the series.[9]
