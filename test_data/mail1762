The Hoary Banksia (Banksia incana) is a species of small shrub in the plant genus Banksia. It occurs on sandplain heathland between Badgingarra and Eneabba in Western Australia, with outlying populations as far south as Perth. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take around 14 days to germinate.[1]  
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
