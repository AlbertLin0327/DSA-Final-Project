Content:
Bleeding Me is a song by the heavy metal band Godsmack from their fourth studio album IV and was written by vocalist Sully Erna. On an interview on XM Radio, lead singer Sully Erna talked about his fame and how he cheated on his girlfriend for many years while the band was touring. She decided to stay with him, but it seemed like she would bring the cheating up whenever they had an argument. The song is about him saying, "I have screwed up and I have paid for it but you continue to bleed the life from me when you bring the subject up." He gave her credit during the interview, saying that it was a huge pill for her to swallow and he appreciates her for that.
