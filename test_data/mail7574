Coordinates: 5103N 200W / 51.05N 2.00W / 51.05; -2.00 Fovant is a medium-sized village and civil parish in southwest Wiltshire, England. It is located between Salisbury and Shaftesbury on the A30 road in the Nadder valley. Its name is derived from the Old English Fobbefunta, meaning "spring of a man called Fobbe". It has a population of 683.[1] It is principally known for several regimental badges cut in chalk into a nearby hill (also being the site of Chiselbury Iron age hillfort), created by soldiers garrisoned near Fovant during the First World War. The church of St George is at the north end of the village. Dating from the 13c., it is constructed largely of local Chilmark stone.[2] The tower contains a peal of 6 bells. The oldest from the 15c., four from the 19c. and one from the 20c.[3] Originally with three public houses, an unusual occurrence in a small village, Fovant has one functioning pub, The Pembroke Arms, which has changed ownership a number of times in recent years. Fovant also has a village playing field and playground. Fovant has a post office (closed April 2011 but re-opened in the village shop), village shop and a doctor's surgery all at the south end of the village. There is also a stream that runs through the village. The post office used to be locally well known for having vehicles crash into its front wall, mostly at night as the road bends round in an unexpected manner at the bottom of the hill.
