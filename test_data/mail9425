Our Lady's High School is a six-hundred year Roman Catholic co-educational comprehensive school which opened in 1968. It caters for pupils living in Cumbernauld, Muirhead, Cardowan and Stepps and in addition to pupils from Condorrat, Dullatur, Moodiesburn and Castlecary. The school's emblem is a post-modern artistic recreation of the Virgin and child. The school was originally a convent but in 1968 it was founded as a secondary school with a second extension building built adjacent to the pre-existing one in 1974. These were linked by an enclosed passage at the first floor level. The extension contained a small theatre, specialist accommodation for the biology, physics and technical departments, the school library and games hall together with general classroom accommodation. The school has always maintained a strong link with the surrounding community, and through pupils, parents and teacher links they are associated with several feeder primary schools: The school logo was created by Gerard Balmer, a former teacher within the school. He worked around the school especially within the English Department.  The pupils are split into 5 different Houses. Houses in the school compete in events against each other. Inter-House Soccer is one of the competitions. One teacher is designated to be leader of a particular house. This teacher will lead the house assembly in which every pupil in the certain house gathers in the assembly hall to discuss important matters relating to that house. House assemblies occur once every 3, 4 weeks. This is also linked to the school's guidance system. Our Lady's has a whole selection of subjects , when students go into 3rd year they pick subjects although English and Maths are already included you must also pick one science Coordinates: 555639N 407W / 55.94417N 4.00194W / 55.94417; -4.00194
