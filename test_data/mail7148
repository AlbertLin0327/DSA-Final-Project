Blain is a borough in Perry County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 252 at the 2000 census. It is part of the HarrisburgCarlisle Metropolitan Statistical Area. Early settlement began around the mill built by James Blaine in 1778, from whom the borough took its name. The final "e" was dropped at some point, although there are records of county newspapers using the "Blaine" spelling through at least 1868. Early in the 1800s, Blaine's mill came into the possession of William Douglas, who had a post office established with the name "Douglas' Mills". A subsequent owner of the mill, Anthony Black, had the name of the post office changed to "Multicaulisville", after the mulberry tree (morus multicaulis), in which he had a financial interest during a speculative bubble in the tree. Lots were platted for sale in 1846 and the name of the post office was changed to "Blain". At one time, Blain was noted for being the smallest borough in Pennsylvania to own its own water plant and electric street lighting system. Jacob Wentz was instrumental in the construction of the first water plant in about 1869 or 1870. The borough was incorporated by an order of the Perry county court on November 3, 1877.[1] Blain is located at 402014N 773038W / 40.33722N 77.51056W / 40.33722; -77.51056 (40.337233, -77.510525)[2].
