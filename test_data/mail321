Frederick George Lee (b. 6 January 1832 in Thame, Oxfordshire; d. 22 January 1902 at Lambeth, London) was a priest of the Church of England, author, and founder of the Order of Corporate Reunion. Lee was trained in Cuddesdon Theological College and ordained to priesthood in 1856 by the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce. Lee became, together with Ambrose de Lisle and others, a co-founder of the Association for Promoting the Union of Christendom (APUC). In Aberdeen he had difficulties with the bishop concerning his ritualistic practices and later became vicar of All Saints' Lambeth, London.[1] Lee founded a clandestine Anglo-Papalist society, the Order of Corporate Reunion, to continue the work of the APUC and to restore an apostolic succession recognised by the Roman Catholic Church, through reordinations, as a means for reunion. Lee is believed to have been secretly consecrated as a bishop by some Roman Catholic prelates whose names were kept secret. Later, however, Lee became disillusioned and recognized that he had made a mistake.[2] Lee was received into the Roman Catholic Church on 11 December 1901, shortly before his death.
