A chalkboard eraser is a special type of eraser specifically used to erase chalk markings on slating paint (used on chalkboards and slates). It is most commonly made of felt strips attached to a handle. Chalkboard erasers were first invented around 1863 by John L. Hammett, who owned some stores that sold and created school products in Rhode Island and then later in Boston. Mostly slates were sold there as well as chalk and so on. At the time, rags or old cloths were used to erase and get rid of the chalk markings on slates in schools, offices, and everywhere. Hammett created the chalkboard before the invention of the chalkboard eraser by creating slating paint. It was when Hammett nearly "discovered" instead of intentionally created a substitute for rags when he was giving a presentation on his chalkboard when instead of using a rag, used wool felt strips to wipe off the chalk writing. After he realized how much better the wool worked, he gathered with a team and created the custom eraser to sell. That was a success for Hammett, and later in the late years of the 19th century, he created a company and sold more than erasers. He made inexpensive school supplies for teachers and schoolhouses available for use such as paper, ink, etc. The company went on selling all of the supplies and chalkboard erasers until Hammett sold the entire company and ownership to someone else. The idea spread, and it still is currently.
