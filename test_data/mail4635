145 Adeona is a rather large main-belt asteroid. Its surface is very dark, and probably composed of primitive carbonaceous material.[citation needed] The Adeona family of asteroids is named after it. It was discovered by C. H. F. Peters on June 3, 1875, from the observatory at Hamilton College, Clinton, New York. Peters named it after Adeona, the Roman goddess of homecoming, because he had recently returned from a journey across the world to observe the transit of Venus. Peters also discovered 144 Vibilia on the same night.[1] Adeona has been observed to occult a star once, on July 9, 2002.[citation needed]
