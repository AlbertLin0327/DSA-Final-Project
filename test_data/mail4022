"Stuck in the Middle" is Clea's second single single. It was released in the UK on 16 February 2004 and giving them their second Top 30, charting at #28. The girls performed this song in many shows, like Top of the Pops. The song appears on their international debut album, Identity Crisis, and was re-recorded for their UK debut album: Trinity. Clea filmed a video for this single, in black and white. The four girls are featured doing sexy moves and apparently hiding or looking for someone. The "Stuck in the Middle" video was edited in 2006, removing the scenes where the old member, Chloe, appeared in. The re-recorded version of the song is played and new scenes can be seen with only the three remaining girls. This video was used as the promo for the Europe release of the double-a-side single with "I Surrender".
