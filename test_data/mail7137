"Fight for Right" is a song written by the English composer Edward Elgar, with words taken from The Story of Sigurd the Volsung by William Morris. It was published by Elkin in 1916, and dedicated to Members of the Fight for Right Movement. There are nine introductory bars of music, followed by the first four lines of the poem sung Quasi recit. ad lib. The next two lines are accompanied a tempo, then repeated as a chorus. FIGHT FOR RIGHT Quasi recit. ad lib. a tempo Chorus
