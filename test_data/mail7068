The Beatles' recording sessions are highly sought after by fans, as their outtakes and demos are seen as collectables and have historical significance. The Beatles' studio session tapes are kept at Abbey Road Studios, formerly known as "EMI Studios" until 1970, where The Beatles recorded most of their music. Some outtakes and demos are very common, such as those released with The Beatles Anthology. Most have never been officially released; however, some are available on bootlegs. Some unreleased studio recordings were used in The Beatles: Rock Band video game before and after songs, as background noise and to give faded songs endings. All songs written by LennonMcCartney except where noted. All single and album releases are for the United Kingdom. In the spring or summer of 1958, The Quarrymen (The Beatles' original name) recorded two songs at Phillips' Sound Recording Services in their hometown of Liverpool. The recordings were pressed onto a mono 10-inch 78rpm shellac disc and the sessions tapes were erased to be used with new customers. Due to the low quality and age of the recordings, the songs are filled with hiss but are still listenable. It was the group's first recording session, for which they paid 17s 6d (87.5p or 15.24 now[1]). The record was not intended for release but for The Quarrymen's personal use.[2][3] In 1981, Lowe sold the record to McCartney for an undisclosed figure. McCartney had audio engineers attmept to improve the sound quality.[2][3] The Quarrymen recorded several low-quality homemade mono demo tapes. Those known to still exist are: As they did when they were The Quarrymen, The Beatles recorded several low-quality homemade mono demo tapes. The tapes are the only known recordings featuring their former bass guitarist Stuart Sutcliffe. From the 16 known demos made in early 1960 at McCartney's house, only three have been released.[4][5][6] On 15October 1960, in Hamburg, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison recorded a song as the backing group for Lu Walters, the bassist from Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. The Beatles' drummer, Pete Best, was not present, and Hurricanes drummer Ringo Starr played instead. It was the first time John, Paul, George and Ringo recorded music together. Sutcliffe was present at the session but did not play. The song was recorded in the small Akustik studio, in a similar arrangement to The Beatles' recordings at Phillips' Sound Recording Services. The song, with a spoken advertisement as the B-side, was pressed onto nine mono 78rpm acetate discs. After the song was recorded, Walters, Starr, Ty Brian and Johnny Byrne, all in the Hurricanes, recorded "Fever" and "September Song". None of the recordings made were ever released. The session tapes were most likely erased and none of the discs are known to have survived.[7] On 22June, in Hamburg, The Beatles (under the name "The Beat Brothers") recorded several songs with English rock and roller Tony Sheridan, for an album called My Bonnie. After recording the songs with Sheridan, The Beatles recorded two songs by themselves. The session tapes have since been destroyed, but the songs have been issued on numerous singles and albums, both official and unofficial. Sheridan made more recordings with different backing musicians, resulting in some debate over which songs The Beatles are on. They are generally believed to appear on seven tracks.[8] On 1January, The Beatles recorded an audition for Decca Records in London. The Beatles did not pass the audition but their manager, Brian Epstein, kept the reel-to-reel tapes to present to other record producers. The recordings were pressed onto a mono acetate disc and were later heard by Parlophone producer George Martin. The likely order of the songs was:[12] After hearing the Decca audition recordings, Martin decided to give The Beatles an audition at EMI Studios in London. The audition on 6June, between 6 and 8pm, also acted as their first EMI recording session. They recorded in Studio 2 or 3, with Studio 2 later becoming the studio in which they recorded most of their music. The session tapes were destroyed per standard protocol; however, at least two mono recordings have since been discovered. Most documentation from the session has been destroyed; however, it is known that four songs were recorded in an unknown amount of takes. The Beatles passed the audition; however, Martin was not satisfied with Best's drumming and wanted him replaced. It would be his only recording session at EMI before he was replaced with Ringo Starr.[14] 90 days after their audition, they returned to EMI Studios, with their new drummer, to record their debut single in Studio 2, between 7 and 10pm. They began work on Mitch Murray's "How Do You Do It", which Martin had chosen for them, but they disliked the song and wanted to release an original composition. At least two takes of "How Do You Do It" and at least 15 takes of "Love Me Do" were recorded, and the best take of each song was mono mixed and pressed onto an acetate disc for Epstein to hear. The session tapes were later destroyed as was common practice then. This session's version of "Love Me Do" was released as The Beatles' first single; however, it was later replaced with a version recorded seven days later and the original was destroyed. When the original was later released on the compilation Past Masters, Vol. 1, it had to be sourced from a mono 45rpm single.[15] Concerned with Starr's drumming, the producers hired session drummer Andy White for another attempt at recording The Beatles' first single. Between 10am and 1pm, in Studio 2, they recorded three songs with White drumming. The best takes of "Love Me Do" and "P.S. I Love You" were mono mixed. An unknown number of takes of "Please Please Me" were also recorded but none were used. The session tapes were later destroyed, thus there are no true stereo versions of the songs, although at least one mono recording has been discovered.[16] Although the previous session's version of "Love Me Do" was released as the single, following the release of The Beatles' Hits EP, it was replaced with the version from this session and destroyed.[17] "Love Me Do" and "P.S. I Love You" were mixed in duophonic "fake stereo" on 25February 1963, in Studio 1, between 2.30 and 5.45pm.[18] Although they were originally released in fake stereo on the stereo version of Please Please Me, the 2009 remastered stereo version contains the songs in mono. Between 7 and 10pm, in Studio 2, The Beatles recorded their second single. They also performed an original composition, "Tip of My Tongue", but Martin was unhappy with the arrangement. They never recorded it again and, instead, gave it to Tommy Quickly, another artist managed by Epstein. "Please Please Me" and "Ask My Why" were mono mixed on 30November, in Studio 2. An edit and stereo mix of "Please Please Me" and a new mono and a stereo mix of "Ask Me Why" were made on 25February 1963, in Studio 1, between 2.30 and 5.45pm, for inclusion on the mono and stereo Please Please Me albums.[19][18] Between 10am and 10.45pm, in Studio 2, they recorded their debut album, Please Please Me. In 1963, the convention of destroying session tapes after the final mixes were made mostly ceased; however, this session's takes of "Hold Me Tight" were destroyed, as the song was left unused until they re-recorded it for their next album.[20] On 20February, in Studio 1, between 10.30am and 1pm, Martin recorded overdubs for "Misery" and "Baby It's You". The album was edited and mixed on 25February, in Studio 1, between 10am and 1pm and 2.30 and 5.45pm. The song "Seventeen" was later retitled "I Saw Her Standing There".[18] 10am 1pm 2.306pm 7.3010.45pm Between 2.30 and 10pm, in Studio 2, The Beatles recorded their third single. They also wanted to record "What Goes On" and "The One After 909", later retitled "One After 909". In the end, only the latter was recorded but the song remained unused until it was re-recorded during the Get Back sessions. "What Goes On" was later re-recorded for Rubber Soul. On 13March, in Studio 2, Lennon recorded a harmonica overdub for "Thank You Little Girl", later retitled "Thank You Girl", the single's B-side, and the song was edited and mixed. The A-side, "From Me to You", was edited and mixed on 14March, in Studio 2, between 10am and 1pm.[21] 2.305pm 710pm Studio 2, 10am 1pm On 1 July 1963, in studio 2, the Beatles recorded their fourth single. The number of takes recorded is unknown as the documentation and session tapes were later destroyed. The songs were edited and mixed in mono on 4 July 1963. No stereo mixes were ever made from the master recordings.[23] There are no take numbers since they were not formal studio recording sessions, but rehearsals filmed for Let It Be. Some of the songs were released on later Beatles or solo records. Songs (arranged by artist): Numerous improvisations were also recorded during these sessions. Let It Be was put together from the above Get Back sessions, thus some of the songs do not have formal take numbers. Songs: Paul McCartney: During the Get Back sessions, McCartney also previewed several new compositions that he would later include on his solo albums. John Lennon: Lennon also recorded several songs that he would later release during the Get Back sessions. George Harrison: Harrison was also one to submit new material during the Get Back sessions. The albums released as part of the The Beatles Anthology Anthology 1 (1995), Anthology 2 (1996) and Anthology 3 (1996) and the coinciding singles "Free as a Bird" (1995) and "Real Love" (1996) are the only official releases containing some of The Beatles' studio sessions and demo tapes. The Beatles Anthology documentary also includes unreleased recordings, as well as live performances, interviews and film and television footage.
