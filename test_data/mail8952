Elliot John Gleave (20 June 1982) better known by his stage name Example, is a British singer and rapper signed to Data Records. His name arose due to his initials being E.G., which is an abbreviation of the Latin phrase "exempli gratia", which means "for example".[1] Example first found success with the release of his second album, Won't Go Quietly, which peaked at number 4 on the UK Albums Chart.[2] The album had two top 10 singles, Won't Go Quietly and Kickstarts.[3] His third album Playing in the Shadows was released on 4 September 2011.[4] The album debuted at number 1 on the UK Album Charts with two number 1 singles, Changed the Way You Kiss Me and Stay Awake.[5] Elliot Gleave was born at a West London Pub, Hammersmith, the elder of two children, and attended All Saints Primary School in Fulham. He later went on to attend ADT College (now Ashcroft Technology Academy) in Wandsworth. Gleave has claimed in interviews that the main reason he started rapping was due to his introduction to hip-hop through albums by Wu-Tang Clan and Snoop Dogg  the latter's album purchased primarily for "the cool cover art". In 2000, Elliot attended Royal Holloway, University of London to study film directing. While at university, he started garage MCing to make some money. It was during this period that he met Joseph Gardner, AKA Rusher, the producer whom he would later go on to work with. Gleave and Gardner made a concept album in the audio booth of the University film department which would go on to be Example's first white-label vinyl release, "A Pointless Song". Following graduation, Gleave worked in Australia for a year in the props departments of films such as Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. He returned to the UK and became a voiceover artist and editor for the Paramount Comedy Channel (now Comedy Central),[6] also working as an editor at MTV Networks.[7] After releasing three singles through his own label "All The Chats", including the original 7" version of "I Don't Want To" in January 2006, Example received attention from Pete Tong, Zane Lowe and others at Radio 1. Example also caught the attention of people at four major record labels  perhaps most significantly Mike Skinner (of The Streets), owner of The Beats label. After signing a deal in April 2006 with The Beats, Example put out a response to Lily Allen's No.1 hit "Smile" entitled "Vile" and received Radio 1 airplay from Zane Lowe, Jo Whiley and Chris Moyles. His first 'proper' release on The Beats was "What We Made" in November 2006, the video for which was filmed in Chernobyl, Ukraine (see below). Example's second official Beats single entitled "You Can't Rap" was released in March 2007, followed by a re-release of "I Don't Want To" on 11 June 2007. "I Don't Want To" was followed by the single "So Many Roads" (famously sampling The Carpenters "We've Only Just Begun") which eventually turned out to be the opening track on Example's full-length studio debut. After the demise of The Beats label at the end of 2007 Example self-released his next single "Me + Mandy" on 10 March 2008 through his original imprint All The Chats. The video for "Me + Mandy" was shot over 4 days and nights in London, in over 30 locations with over 40 extras. Impressively all this was done at a cost of just 1000. It was directed by Example's friend Caran Melly who also made the promos for "Who Needs Sunshine?", "Vile", "You Can't Rap" and "I Don't Want To". In February 2008 Example also tried his hand at stand-up comedy as part of BBC2's The Culture Show. Mentored by English comic Richard Herring, Example spent six weeks writing and practicing his own stand-up routine which culminated in his first ever stand-up show in front of 60 paying customers in a Covent Garden pub. A week later he appeared on the bill under Richard Herring, Phill Jupitus and Harry Hill at the Lyric Hammersmith  interestingly Example had performed in the same venue ten years earlier whilst a student at ADT College. Example made his first chart appearance in September 2009, when he released "Watch the Sun Come Up" as the lead single from his second album Won't Go Quietly through Data Records. The single debuted at number 20 on the UK Singles Chart, rising to number 19 the following week. The single was followed by a release of "Won't Go Quietly", released on 18 January 2010. The single debuted at number 6 in the United Kingdom, marking Example's first appearance within the top 10. It also peaked 36 in Ireland. The announcement was then made in April 2010 that the second album Won't Go Quietly would be released on 21 June 2010 and would be preceded by the single "Kickstarts". Receiving its radio debut on 13 April by BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe, the song was produced by Sub Focus. "Kickstarts" was released on 20 June, where it debuted at number 3. Released the following week, the album Won't Go Quietly debuted at number 4 on the UK Albums Chart. On 12 September, Example released "Last Ones Standing" as the fourth cut from the album, where it reached a peak of number 27 in the United Kingdom and 37 in Ireland. On 14 November 2010, he released the final single off the album "Two Lives", though it only peaked at 84 on the UK Singles Chart. On the other hand, it was able to peak at number 10 on the UK Dance Chart. It was revealed in January 2011 via Example's Twitter that work on the third album had begun. During an interview, Example revealed the forthcoming album would remain dance orientated, although he would make a gradual move into electronicgenres.[8] The lead single from the album is named "Changed the Way You Kiss Me" and was released in June 2011.[9] On 24 March 2011 "Changed the Way You Kiss Me" debuted on BBC Radio 1 as Zane Lowe's Hottest Record in the World. In an interview with Lowe he revealed that his third album would be released in September 2011, entitled Playing in the Shadows. Example described the album as a darker record than previous album Won't Go Quietly. Example's second United Kingdom tour began in February 2011, with support acts including Wretch 32 and Neon Hitch. On 5 June 2011 he released his first single from his third album, "Changed the Way You Kiss Me" where it debuted at number one in the UK. The song also charted in many European countries and Australia, where it was also certified Platinum. The second song of the album "Stay Awake", which was produced by Nero, was debuted on Friday 1 July 2011 on BBC Radio 1 by Annie Mac. It was released on 28 August, and also debuted at number 1. His third single will be "Midnight Run" was released on 4 December 2011 and reached number 36 in the UK singles Chart. His third studio album, "Playing in the Shadows" debuted at number one in the UK albums chart and also charted in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
