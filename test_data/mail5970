Kadrenci is a small settlement in the Municipality of Cerkvenjak in northeastern Slovenia. It lies in the Slovene Hills (Slovene: Slovenske gorice), on the south side of the regional road leading east from Cerkvenjak to Sveti Jurij ob avnici. The area was part of the traditional region of Lower Styria and is now included in the Drava statistical region.[2] Administrative centre: Cerkvenjak
