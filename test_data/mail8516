Mara bar ("son of ") Serapion, sometimes spelled Mara bar Sarapion was a Stoic philosopher from the Roman province of Syria. He is noted for a letter he wrote in Syriac to his son, who was also named Serapion.[1][2] The letter was composed sometime between 73 AD and the 3rd century, and may be an early non-Christian references to the crucifixion of Jesus.[1][3][4] The letter refers to the unjust treatment of "three wise men": the murder of Socrates, the burning of Pythagoras, and the execution of "the wise king" of the Jews.[1][2] The author explains that in all three cases the wrongdoing resulted in the future punishment of those responsible by God and that when the wise are oppressed, not only does their wisdom triumph in the end, but God punishes their oppressors.[4] The letter includes no Christian themes and the author is presumed to be a pagan.[2][3] Some scholars see the reference to the execution of the "wise king" of the Jews as an early non-Christian reference to Jesus.[1][2][3] Criteria that support the non-Christian origin of the letter include the observation that "king of the Jews" was not a Christian title, and that the letter's premise that Jesus lives on based on the wisdom of his teachings is in contrast to the Christian concept that Jesus continues to live through his resurrection.[3][4] Scholars such as Robert Van Voorst see little doubt that the reference to the execution of the "king of the Jews" is about the death of Jesus.[4] Others such as Craig A. Evans see less value in the letter, given its uncertain date, and the possible ambiguity in the reference.[5] Mara Bar-Serapion's letter is preserved in a 6th or 7th century manuscript (BL Add. 14658) held by the British Library, and was composed sometime between 73 AD and the 3rd century.[1] The beginning of the letter makes it clear that it is written to the author's son: "Mara, son of Serapion , to my son Serapion , greetings."[3] The key passage is as follows: In this passage the author explains that when the wise are oppressed, not only does their wisdom triumph in the end, but God also punishes their oppressors.[4] The context of the letter is that the Romans had destroyed Mara's city in a war, taking him prisoner along with others. The letter was written from prison to encourage the author's son to pursue wisdom. It takes the form of a set of rhetorical questions which ask about the benefits of persecuting wise men.[3][4] Mara hints that the occupation of his land will in the end bring shame and disgrace on the Romans. His letter advises the pursuit of wisdom to face the difficulties of life.[4] The letter includes no Christian themes and the author is presumed to be a pagan.[2][3] The non-Christian origin of the letter is supported by the observation that "king of the Jews" was not a Christian title during the time period the letter was written.[3][4] The statement in the letter that the wise king lives on because of the "new law" he laid down is also seen as an indication of its non-Christian origin, for it ignores the Christian belief that Jesus continues to live through his resurrection.[3][4] Given that the gospel portraits of Jesus' crucifixion place much of the blame for the execution of Jesus on the Roman procurator Pontius Pilate (with the Jewish mob merely acting as agitators), the letter does not reflect an awareness of Christian teachings.[3] And referring to "king of the Jews" rather than the Savior of Son of God indicates that the impressions of Bar-Serapion were not formed by Christian sources.[3] Scholars such as Robert Van Voorst see little doubt that the reference to the execution of the "king of the Jews" is about the death of Jesus.[4] Van Voorst states that possible reasons for Bar-Serapion to suppress the name of Jesus from the letter include the ongoing persecutions of Christians at the time and his desire not to offend his Roman captors who also destroyed Jerusalem.[4] Others such as Craig A. Evans sees less value in the letter, given its uncertain date, and the possible ambiguity in the reference.[5] Bruce Chilton states that Bar-Serapion reference to the "king of Jews" may be related to the INRI inscription on the cross of Jesus' crucifixion, as in the Gospel of Mark (15:26 paragraph 1).[3] Van Voorst states that the parallels drawn between the unjust treatment of three men, and the destruction of Athens and Samos leads to the conclusion that Bar-Serapion viewed the destruction of Jerusalem as punishment for the Jewish rejection of Jesus.[4] Critics of this interpretation, however, argue that unlike the references to Socrates and Pythagoras, bar Serapion does not explicitly mention Jesus by name, thereby rendering the actual identity of the "wise king" in the letter less than certain.[5]
