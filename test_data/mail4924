Paul Lendvai (born 1929 as Pl Lendvai) is a Hungarian-born journalist who became an Austrian citizen. After various communist party activities in Hungary, he went to Austria in 1957, working as an author and journalist. Lendvai was born on 24 August 1929 in Budapest. In the late 1940s early 1950s (also known as the Rkosi era) Lendvai worked as a journalist in Hungary starting from 1947[1] he was also member of the interior special police for a time. The unit in which he served was a part of the State Protection Authority (VH) [2] Lendvai wrote for Szabad Np and was also chief of foreign reporting in the Hungarian news agency (MTI).[3] Lendvai's books in the 1950s include "Tito the enemy of the Hungarian people" (1951) and "France at a crossroads" (1955), with 50,000 copies.[4] Lendvai was a member of the communist party, but he did not participate in the suppression of the Revolution of 1956. After the revolution Lendvai participated in putting together the so-called "White Books", aimed at defaming and discrediting the revolution of 1956 [5] talking about "the horrors of the counter revolution". Lendvai later claimed he took part out of "cowardice and opportunism".[6] He left Hungary on assignment to report from Poland and in 1957 he went to Vienna, Austria." After arriving in Vienna, Lendvai soon started looking for work, at first limited by lack of sufficient language skills. While in this early period he helped foreign correspondents with matters relating to Hungary and wrote smaller articles under aliases such as "Gyrgy Holl", "rpd Bcs" or "Paul Landy". Lendvai soon overcame early difficulties and was naturalized in Austria in 1959, and became a journalist and commentator on Eastern Europe. He was the correspondent for Eastern Europe of the daily Die Presse and the Financial Times for twenty two years. He also contributed to The Economist and wrote columns for Austrian, German and Swiss newspapers and radio stations. In 1982 Lendvai became editor-in-chief at the Eastern Europe department of the ORF public broadcasting company and intendant of Radio sterreich International in 1987. His weekly columns are published by Der Standard newspaper. In 1985 a Cultural Forum, dubbed the East-West summit was organized by the Hungarian communist leadership to which 900 politicians, writers and other notable people were invited. At the same time a "counter cultural forum" was planned with the expected participation of "dissidents and opposition groups" Gyrgy Konrd was one of the indended speakers.[7] When Lendvai learned of the counter-forum, he went to Jnos Nagy, the Hungarian ambassador in Vienna at the time. Lendvai provided various information about the counter-forum including documents about the planned program of the event to Hungarian authorities. This was revealed in 2010 when an investigation, "corroborated by five documents in the foreign ministry archives" showed that Paul Lendvai collaborated with the Communist regime.[8] Socialist ex-prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsny came to Paul Lendvais defence, saying " As for me, I support him in his struggle to make a case for his decisions of yesteryear.[] And weve got to stop digging up the past.[9] Gyrgy Konrd one of the indented speakers of the opposition event, said "If this was how things were, then it is very sad" about Lendvai providing the information.[10] Lendvai while admitted to providing the documents about the opposition's forum, but said that his conversation at the embassy was misrepresented in the reports sent to Budapest and overstated the amount of verbal information he provided. Jnos Nagy the ambassador, who Lendvai talked to at the time, was interwieved about the matter on Klubrdi and insited that his reports always faithfully rendered what was said.[10] An article printed in left-wing Npszabadsg agrees with Lendvai's defense that he was not an agent, but calls him a willing collaborant.[11] On 19 March 2011 Lendvai presented the Hungarian translation of his latest book Mein verspieltes Land ("My squandered country") in Budapest.[12] In his memoir, Lendvai portrays a picture of ethnic hatred, political turbulence and antisemitism in 20th century Central Europe. In the 1990s Lendvai tried to obtain the secret service file on himself in a face-to-face meeting with Socialist Prime Minister Gyula Horn but wasn't successful at that time. While being honoured in the Hungarian Parliament Lendvai said "I'd rather get my files than the award".[13] Originally the file was classified until February 15, 2042 but with many other documents they were declassified based on a 2003 law.[14] In 2006 Lendvai requested and received the documents from the archives of the Hungarian secret services and described some of their contents to the public in an article carried by literary weekly let s Irodalom (ES), including naming several spies working on his case.[15] Lendvai writes that the files on him [16] are over 300 hundred pages long and refer to Lendvai under the codename "Cole Michael". Lendvai presents his article on the topic with the subtitle "the story of an unsuccessful recruitment" [17] saying the Hungarian services wanted to enlist him as an agent but failed. While according to the file, Lendvai was never recruited as a spy, in a July 24, 1963 report, the archived documents refer to Lendvai as "one of the best contacts" [18][19] of the intelligence services at the time. Lendvai in his article describes several aims he wanted to achieve by contacting the Hungarian authorities, the ability to travel to Hungary for reporting, travel visa for his mother, and revocation of his Hungarian citizenship enabling him to work in eastern bloc communist countries. He managed to obtain some of these goals he says by bringing Hungarian officials such as Gyula Ortutay to Austrian striptease shows. According to Lendvai both times he brought Ortutay to such a show he would intervene on his behalf. In one case Lendvai writes that the reports of "Urbn", identifying Lendvai as a source of information on various topics were falsified, containing material invented by Urbn himself.[20]
