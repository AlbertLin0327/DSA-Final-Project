The down stream projects of ISP are Omkareshwar, Maheshwar and Sardar Sarovar Project. The Project envisages construction of a 92 m high and 653 m long concrete gravity dam. It provides Irrigation in 1,230 square kilometres of land with annual production of 2700 million units in the districts of Khandwa and Khargone in Madhya Pradesh and power generation of 1000 MW installed capacity (8x125). The reservoir of 12,200,000,000 m3 (9,890,701 acreft) was created. The dam, built as a joint venture between Madhya Pradesh irrigation and National Hydroelectric Power Corporation is the source of the Indra Gandhi canal.

Ha on a Culturable Command Area (CCA) of 1.23 Lac. Ha. Total Catchment Area at the Dam site is 61642km2. Indira Sagar Project is the mother project for the downstream projects on Narmada Basin with largest reservoir in India, having 12.22 Bm3 storage capacity. All the eight units commissioned by March 05 ahead of schedule while generation from first unit was started from Jan.'04. The powerhouse is the second largest surface powerhouse in India.
