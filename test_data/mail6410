The 1999 Big Ten tournament was played from March 4, 1999, to March 7, 1999. The tournament was held at the United Center in Chicago, and won by the Michigan State Spartans. Due to NCAA sanctions, Michigan and Ohio State have vacated the records from this tournament. Similarly, Minnesota's appearance in this tournament was voided. All Big Ten schools play in the tournament. Teams are seeded by conference record, with a tiebreaker system used to seed teams with identical conference records.
