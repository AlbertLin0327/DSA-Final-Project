Disney's PK: Out of the Shadows, also known as Disney's Donald Duck PK or simply PK, is an action-adventure video game released in 2002 by Ubisoft. It stars Donald Duck as Paperinik or "PK" as he battles the Evron Empire. Donald Duck works as a security guard in the Ducklair Tower. He falls asleep and starts dreaming of Daisy Duck and his nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie teasing him. He wishes he was a superhero. An artificial intelligence agrees to help him. He is given a future technological weapon, a new voice and the new name PK. PK is out to stop the aliens named Evronians and save the earth. The game got mostly negative reviews.
