Intellitech Corp. is an electronic design automation (EDA) software company. It is headquartered in Durham, New Hampshire[1] with a development office in Bangalore, India and sales/support offices in Mountain View, California, Ottawa (Canada), and Munich, Germany.[2] The company was incorporated in the US in 1988 and is privately held.[2] Intellitech Corporation owns the trademark "Intellitech" in the US, EU and other countries. [2] Intellitech develops an integrated solution of application software, soft IP and integrated circuits that lower the cost of deploying electronic products. For example, to test more JTAG-based circuits at a time, the company has patented a technique called "Concurrent JTAG" enabling simultaneous test of multiple targets over JTAG (IEE 1149.1) without incurring the penalty of longer JTAG shifting sequences. To enable PCB self-test, the company has patented self-contained on-board JTAG BIST.[3]
