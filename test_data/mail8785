Paul Keeler (born April 17, 1971) is an American rugby union coach.[1] Keeler began playing rugby for Canisius College in Buffalo, New York and later for the Buffalo Old Boys RFC and Rockaway RFC mens clubs. Keeler moved on to become a stalwart of Old Blue RFC and their Rugby Super League team, playing in four play-off experiences, including two semi-finals. Keeler was also a MetNY and NERFU select player during this period. Keeler moved into coaching as a player/coach and was assistant coach to the renowned Australian coach Geoff Mould of Australian schoolboys fame. From 2003 through 2005 Keeler coached Old Blues Division One side, securing consecutive play-off appearances in the Sweet 16. Keeler coached the Super League side of the Old Blue (New York) in 2006 and 2007, guiding them to an appearance in the Super League semi-finals in 2006 and quarter finals respectively. Keelers rep side coaching experiences include being the MetNY select side coach since 2004, and the unbeaten Northeast Select Developmental XV known as The Beagles since 2005. In January 2008 Keeler became the full-time Director of Rugby and Head Coach of San Francisco Golden Gate RFC. In his first year he led the club to a playoff berth, losing to eventual champions the New York Athletic Club. In 2009, with Keeler and the aid of assistant coaches and long time club stalwarts Grant Wells and Karl Thomson, the San Francisco club continued their winning ways with a near perfect season, having lost only one match against rival Belmont Shore. The club secured a berth into the playoffs, where an easy rout of the Dallas Harlequins and a dramatic injury time defeat of the Denver Barbarians earned their way into the Final to face Life University. The club went on to win their first championship by defeating Life 23-13.
