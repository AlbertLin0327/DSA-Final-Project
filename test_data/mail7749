Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias were a comedy rock band, formed in Manchester, England in 1973. Their story is told in the book When We Were Thin (published 2007 by Hotun Press). The name of the band is a corruption of the Latin American band, Alberto y Los Trios Paraguayos. Created in 1973 by former member of Greasy Bear - Chris "C.P." Lee and Jimmy Hibbert (vocals, bass) and Bob Harding (vocals, guitar, bass), the comedy sketch outfit became a musical group in 1974 and was joined by former Greasy Bear drummer Bruce Mitchell (drums), with Les Prior (vocals), Simon White (steel guitar, guitar), Tony Bowers (bass, guitar) and Ray "Mighty Mongo" Hughes (second drummer). They became a popular support act, supporting Hawkwind on their 1974 tour. The group mercilessly parodied the major rock names of the 1970s - "Anadin" was a reworking of Lou Reed's "Heroin" / "Sweet Jane". By 1975 they were topping the bill in their own right and were supported by such acts as The Police, The Stranglers and Blondie. As with many comedy ensembles, the Albertos belied their comic aspirations by their exemplary musicianship,[citation needed] and they released three albums and a variety of spoof discs, culminating in the musical play, Snuff Rock. Snuff Rock, inspired by the then recent film, Snuff, and the concept of snuff movies, but carrying the idea to a band who killed themselves for entertainment, was their musical play presented at London's Royal Court Theatre and Round House, and was famous for the role of the comic disc jockey played by Les Prior. The accompanying EP, "Snuff Rock", released on Stiff Records, poked fun at the punk rock phenomenon, targeting the Sex Pistols ("Gobbing On Life"), The Damned ("Kill") and The Clash ("Snuffin' Like That") as well as myriad reggae bands in "Snuffin' In A Babylon". For once, the Albertos' act was successfully transferred to vinyl. They hit the UK Singles chart with the Status Quo spoof, "Heads Down No Nonsense Mindless Boogie" in 1978. Les Prior died in January 1980 from leukemia, which left a large gap in the group. After their nationally networked TV show Teach Yourself Gibberish and a crack at America with Sleak, the Albertos called it a day in 1982. The band's brand of spoof rock was in the same tradition as that of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and National Lampoon[citation needed].
