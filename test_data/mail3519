Tumalo Falls is a 97-foot (30m) waterfall on Tumalo Creek, in the Cascade Range west of Bend in the U.S. state of Oregon.[2] Additional waterfalls are upstream along Tumalo Creek and a tributary, Bridge Creek.[2][3] All of these falls are within the Deschutes National Forest.[2] The United States Forest Service manages the Tumalo Falls Day Use Area about 14 miles (23km) from Bend by forest roads. In addition to waterfall views, the day-use area has picnic sites and a toilet and offers access to trails for hiking and mountain biking.[3] Using the site requires a Northwest Forest Pass or payment of a fee.[4] Tumalo Falls Trail leads from the picnic area to a viewing platform above Tumalo Falls, about 0.25 miles (0.40km) upstream. The trail continues beyond the falls. About 1.25 miles (2.01km) further upstream, it reaches a second waterfall, Middle Tumalo Falls, a two-tiered cascade totaling 65 feet (20m) in height.[4]
