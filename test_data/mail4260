Carideo was born in in Mount Vernon, New York. He attended the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, where he played quarterback for coach Knute Rockne's Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team from 1928 to 1930. As a college football player he was considered so good, that even Rockne said he was the best quarterback ever. During the 1929 and 1930 seasons, the Fighting Irish posted a perfect 190 record with him as the starter, and he is remembered as a "big play maker." Carideo was also an assistant coach at Purdue in 1931, at Mississippi State from 1935 to 1938, and at Iowa from 1939 to 1942 and 1946 to 1949.
