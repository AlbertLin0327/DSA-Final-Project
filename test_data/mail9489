Art Vandelay was a planned studio album by Australian punk rock band Short Stack, rumored to have a scheduled release in 2012. The album was recorded at The Grove Studios. It was reaching completion, just before the band split up, halting the production of the album. Along with the announcement they released their last ever song and music video, "S.O.U.L.". This also halted the making of Art Vandelay and concluded Short Stack forever. It has not been released since. Both the title and the track listing were revealed on the documentary The Story of Short Stack. Although the album has never been released, a single was released, planned to be on the album. Titled "Bang Bang Sexy", the single was officially released on iTunes on September 19, 2011. Also, a song was released that was originally planned off the album, titled "S.O.U.L.". It was released on 30 March, 2012, as a music video on YouTube. It was the final song and music video by Short Stack. All songs written and composed by Short Stack.
