Social Media[1] has influenced how individuals interact with others and with brands. No longer does one-to-one communication take place behind closed doors. It now takes place in the wide-open spaces of the World Wide Web. It takes place on Facebook, Twitter, blogs and other social platforms. Organizations have begun participating by offering customer support solutions, ratings and reviews and direct venues for social engagement with their target audiences. Smart organizations initially invest heavily in listening posts before they act in the social media universe.[2] In this way they can understand the social conversations taking place and they can significantly enhance their social brand image. The purpose of the ROI of social media is to help social marketers make better decisions, integrate their actions with traditional media and to justify their budgets through the measurement of past success. Measuring the ROI of social media has been a challenge because of the indirect link between social media engagement and outcomes such as purchasing behavior, loyalty and recommendations. [3] Important to brands operating in social media is their impact on their target audiences. Only with the right engagement, messages and response can brands improve their brand image, their brand value and the likelihood that they will have a tangible impact on their bottom line. Along with these objectives[4] organizations must measure their success in order to make certain they are improving their position with their target audiences, driving increased value in terms of their brand image and of course increased profit, all of which drive increased social media budgets. Social media accountability is now a key component of social media marketing activities. Social marketers must make certain they are measuring the right things in order to make certain they are delivering on these objectives. The media engagement framework provides this structure as it relates to how social marketers can engage with the right audiences in the right way to drive increased brand value. These audiences break down into three primary personae: The media engagement framework describes this measurement structure to make certain that increased value is delivered for the brand. The media engagement framework has three levels: Lastly, critical to a complete picture of the media engagement framework is the competitive set within which a social marketer must compete. These are: In the past many social media marketers consider their actions in social media as a standalone activity separate from their actions in traditional media. This is now changing and the topic of the ROI of Social Media is to make certain to consider social media an equal peer with traditional media. Just as traditional media is made up of many channels  TV, radio, print and digital  so, too, is social media composed of many channels  Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and blogs. It is the full integration of these two spheres of marketing into a comprehensive marketing strategy that can deliver the best results for the brand. The measurement framework must support this framework so that marketers can make significantly better strategic and tactical marketing decisions. The media engagement framework is a key component to understanding this key concept.
