The MKT Mod 72 is an Albanian circular metal cased anti-tank blast mine, a copy of the Russian TM-46. Two versions of the mine are produced, the PX designated version of the mine is fitted with a secondary fuze well in the base of the mine that accepts an MUV type anti-lifting device. The mine uses a mechanical pressure fuze similar to the Russian MV-5. The mine is found in small numbers in Kosovo.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
