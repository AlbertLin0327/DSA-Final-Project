Pen y Clawdd Castle was a Norman-era motte and bailey style castle protected by a double moat, near Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, in southern Wales. The exact origins of the castle are unknown, but some believe it may have been constructed by Roger de Hastings during the 11th century. The original timber structure is long gone, leaving only a mound and the remaining moat ditches, but adjacent to the castle still stands Pen y Clawdd Court, a 15th-century Tudor manor house and gardens that at one time operated as a country inn. The dwelling is thought to have been originally built around 1625 and added to later. Coordinates: 515231N 30014W / 51.8753N 3.0039W / 51.8753; -3.0039
