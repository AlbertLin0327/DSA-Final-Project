"One" is a song by American recording artist Sky Ferreira. The song was written by Ferreira, Christian Karlsson, Magnus Lidehll, Marit Bergman and Pontus Winnberg, and produced by Bloodshy & Avant. The song was released on August 23, 2010, as the first European single of her upcoming debut album.[1] "One" was written by Sky Ferreira and Marit Bergman in less than 30 minutes,[2] and produced by Bloodshy & Avant, responsible for some of Britney Spears' hits such as "Toxic", "Piece of Me" and "Radar".[3] Sky described the song's meaning as "being numb and wanting to feel love, happiness, sadnessanything, really. Its kind of like someone wanting - needing a heart."[2] In an interview with DigitalSpy, Sky further explained the meaning behind "One": "It's about that point where you don't feel anything - you don't feel happy, you don't feel sad but you want to feel something. It's a situation I was in and I think everyone's been in. There's always someone in a relationship who wants more attention and starts trying too hard to please the other person. The thing is, the more you try to please that person, the less effort they make because they know you'll do anything they want. It's that stage I'm singing about on 'One'."[4] "One" entered the UK Singles Chart on August 29, 2010 at #64. The music is directed by photographer Rankin and was released to the Parlophone YouTube channel on 2 July, 2010. The scenes are mostly close-ups of Ferreira in a red outfit on a flashing floor, singing into a shadeless lamp in a white room, jumping in slow motion, and pulling on a white parachute.[1]
