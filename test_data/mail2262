Turbolinux is a Japanese Linux distribution targeting Asian users. The Turbolinux distribution was created as a rebranded Red Hat distribution by (then) Pacific HiTech employee Scott Stone. Scott was the lead release engineer through version 3.6. Turbolinux is notable for including licensed copies of CyberLink PowerDVD and Windows Media binary codecs.[1] Turbolinux (the company) was founded in 1992 as Pacific HiTech in Sandy, Utah by Cliff and Iris Miller.[2] PHT changed its name to Turbolinux in June 1999 to better identify with its flagship product. The Millers were "terminated without cause" from Turbolinux in July 2000 [3] after a disagreement with venture capitalists.[4] After several rounds of layoffs, Turbolinux sold its name and distribution to Japanese software corporation SRA in September 2002.[5] The former headquarters at Brisbane, California closed its doors shortly thereafter and all operations were relocated to Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan.[6] Turbolinux successfully completed an IPO on the Osaka Stock Exchange in September 2005[7] underwritten by Nikko Citigroup, Livedoor Securities Co. Ltd., and Mizuho Investors Securities Co., Ltd. Turbolinux is a member of the Interop Vendor Alliance.[8][9]
