State Route 5 marker Georgia State Routes Former State Route 5 (SR5) is a route that bisects northern Georgia. It passes through the county seats of Blue Ridge, Ellijay, Jasper, Canton, Marietta, and Douglasville. Along the way, it overlaps one of metro Atlanta's freeways, I-575. From the Cherokee/Pickens County line to Blue Ridge, Georgia 5 is cosigned with SR515. It also shares routing with US76 from Ellijay to Blue Ridge. This route parallels the Marietta and North Georgia Rail Line. SR5 begins at the Alabama state line in Carroll County. It travels as a strictly rural route from there to the Douglasville area. It is concurrent with US78/SR8 from Douglasville to Austell. It has short concurrencies with SR92 in Douglasville and US278 in Austell. It heads northeast to the Marietta area where it intersects I-575. It is concurrent with I-575 all the way to the freeway's northern terminus, near Nelson. It has a long concurrency with SR515 from the Ball Ground-Nelson area[citation needed] to Blue Ridge. It winds its way through the North Georgia mountains and the above-mentioned county seats. It has a concurrency with US76/SR2 from Ellijay to Blue Ridge. SR5 ends at its northern terminus at the Tennessee state line in the bordertown of McCaysville. In October 2007, SR5 was rerouted through Marietta. Prior to the rerouting, the road went south from the split with I-75 through downtown Marietta, and joined the SR120 Loop southward. Currently, the road exits I-75 onto a ramp for US41, and joins US41 going south for a few miles, then going west on SR120 ALT until the road becomes east bound SR120), following the same routing of the old SR120 Loop, which was decommissioned at the same time. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, Interstate 575 and SR515 were constructed. SR5 between Canton and Marietta had become a congested and dangerous route. This new freeway would alleviate these problems. Upon completion, the signage for SR5 was removed from the state roads it signified and placed alongside the I-575 and SR515 shields; thus forming "Old Highway 5". Throughout the 1990s, parts of Old SR5 from Sixes Road at I-575 in Toonigh to SR5 Spur in Marietta were assigned the inventory route number SR754 to complete state projects planned for the route before it was completely turned back. However, at that point, the entire route was already maintained by the respective counties. The southern terminus of this route is just north of the Marietta square where Cherokee Street joins Canton Road. However, because of The Zell Miller Mountain Parkway (SR515) that begins at I-575's northern terminus, Old SR5 stretches all the way to northern Ellijay, forming a continuous stretch of former routing over 60 miles (97km) long. North of that point, the new four-lane highway was built along the existing road and older routings are in pieces north of there including parts in Whitepath, Cherry Log, and Blue Ridge. SR5 over its history has contained a tremendous number of bannered routes. The current and notable former ones are as follows: Follows part of Barrett Parkway from US41/SR3 to I-575/SR5]]/SR417. Established in 1999 along a new connector road from SR140 to SR5 BUS. This short route was originally slated to be a new location of SR140. Established in 1987 on a limited-access connection to Old SR5 (Canton Road) on what had been SR5 Connector prior to the relocation of mainline SR5 to I-575 in 1985. Two sections of Old SR5 were retained as SR5 ALT in Jasper and Ellijay while the new route was under construction. The Jasper portion was first formed in 1981, extended in 1984, and deleted in early 1986. The Ellijay portion was first formed in 1984 and deleted when work was completed on the new route in 1986. SR5 BUS was established in 1986 along the former SR5 when SR5 was relocated to I-575. The route extends actually west and north of the downtown of Woodstock, but is the major commercial strip for the city. All but 2 miles (3.2km) of the highway are actually parts of SR20 and SR140. SR5 BUS in Ball Ground is mostly SR372, but resulted in 1 mile (1.6km) of new route in 1989 to make a full business route for the city, though it actually runs west of downtown. The highway follows the former SR5 and part of the old Jasper By-Pass. SR5 BUS in Blue Ridge maintained Old SR5 through Blue Ridge as a state highway, but was deleted in 1989 along with its overlapping route, US76 BUS.
