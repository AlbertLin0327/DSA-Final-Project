Sunchyme is the title of a song by English dance trio Dario G. It was released in September 1997 as the lead single from the album, Sunmachine. The song reached the top 5 position in many European music charts. It also topped the Billboard Top Dance Music/Club Play chart following its US release in May 1998. In the United Kingdom, the song peaked at number 2 whilst Elton John's "Candle in the Wind" was at number-one. A record was achieved by this: the largest amounts of sales difference between a number-one and number 2 song in the UK Singles Chart. The song features a sample from English dream pop band, The Dream Academy, using their song, "Life in a Northern Town". The music video of this song features a tribe of African people having their bodies covered with colourful paint to portray animals like in their native land. Later, they jump into a river to wash away the paint. Sunchyme is famous for having only two lines of lyrics "hey um mum mum ma" and "little lion" in reference to Africa.
