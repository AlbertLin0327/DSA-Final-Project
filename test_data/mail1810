Live: The Beautiful Soul Tour is the name of a live album and live DVD by American pop singer Jesse McCartney. It features live performances of songs from his debut studio album Beautiful Soul. Two songs from the studio version, "Come To Me" and "Why Is Love So Hard To Find", are replaced with "Best Day of My Life" and "Good Life".
