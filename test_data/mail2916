Air Vice-Marshal Sir Edward Hedley 'Mouse' Fielden, GCVO, CB, DFC, AFC, (b. December 1903 - d. 8 November 1976) was a Royal Air Force pilot and World War II veteran. He was born in Bracknell, Berkshire, the son of a doctor. He was educated at Heatherdown School, Ascot, and Malvern College. He obtained a short service commission with the Royal Air Force in 1924, flying with No. 25 and then No. 23 Squadron in 1925 and 1926. He was posted to the meteorological flight at Duxford in September 1926. After his five-year commission he was posted to the Reserve as a Flight Lieutenant. Fielden figured largely in the flying activities of the Royal Family for more than three decades, and most important royal flights were subject to his scrutiny and recommendation. His discretion and self-effacement earned him the nickname of "Mouse". His association with the Royal Family began in 1929 when the then Prince of Wales (later to become King Edward VIII), who had acquired a Gipsy Moth, appointed Fielden as his personal pilot. In October 1933 the Prince appointed Flight Lieutenant Fielden as his Chief Air Pilot and Extra Equerry. With the death of King George V on 20 January 1936 Edward VIII succeeded to the throne and on 21 July that same year Fielden was appointed Captain of the King's Flight. Edward's reign was short-lived and he abdicated on 11 December 1936 to be succeeded by his brother George VI. Fielden was retained as Captain of the King's Flight and his role was expanded. He was charged with the carriage not only of members of the Royal Family but also members of the Air Council and other important State personages. Fielden had remained in the RAF Reserve and was promoted to Wing Commander in 1936. He returned to the Service when World War II broke out and at the beginning of 1942 he was given command of 161 Squadron based at RAF Tempsford. In October 1942 he was promoted to Group Captain and took command of RAF Tempsford, where 138 (Special Duties) Squadron was now also based. Fielden played an important role in directing operations in support of the Resistance movements in Europe. He was awarded a DFC in April 1943. Later that same year his services to the Royal Family were recognised by his appointment as a CVO. Early in 1945 he was appointed commander of the base at RAF Woodhall Spa. After the war in May 1946 the King's Flight was reformed with Fielden once again its Captain. He was created a KCVO in 1952. Following the death of King George VI on 6 February 1952, he was confirmed in his royal appointment and the unit was renamed as the Queen's Flight soon after the accession of Queen Elizabeth II. He retired from the Queen's Flight in 1962 and at the same time he was appointed Senior Air Equerry to the Queen and promoted to Air Vice-Marshal. He was advanced to GCVO in 1968 and retired as Senior Air Equerry in 1969. Fielden died on 8 November 1976 in Edinburgh, Scotland, at the age of 72. Fielden married Mary Angela Jodrell, the daughter of Lieutenant Colonel H. R. Jodrell, in 1940. He had a son, who predeceased him, and a daughter.
