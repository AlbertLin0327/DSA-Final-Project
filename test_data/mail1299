The World Trade Institute (WTI) is a center of advanced studies of the University of Bern. It is located in Berne, Switzerland and directed by Professor Thomas Cottier. The institute was founded in 1999 by the Universities of Bern, Fribourg and Neuchtel within the framework of the BeNeFri convention, which calls for closer cooperation between the three universities of the Swiss Mittelland.[1] Dedicated to capacity building and raising global awareness of international economic law and economics, the institute maintains close ties to the Institute of European and International Economic Law (IEW) at the University of Bern. The WTI provides graduate studies and a forum for interdisciplinary research and teaching in international trade law and economics.[2] Fostering interaction between students and professionals, the Institute allows researchers and practitioners to establish networks and pool expertise. The WTI offers a graduate master's programme in international trade law and economics (MILE), an annual summer academy, WTO accession training, an executive education programme, and tailor-made courses in trade regulation and economics. In 2005 the WTI became the leading research center for the Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research - NCCR Trade Regulation - which is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.[3] The WTI also hosts an annual World Trade Forum conference where interdisciplinary speakers and scholars from the fields of law, economy, political science and international relations discuss contemporary topics of the world trading system.[4] Papers, comments and conclusions from these conferences are published in the World Trade Forum Book Series by Cambridge University Press. The Master of International Law and Economics (MILE) is the flagship programme of the WTI, established in 1999. The programme combines perspectives in law, economics and international political economy and allows students to pursue in-depth studies with a strong applied perspective on international trade regulation. The MILE is a programme of advanced studies in the field of international trade regulation and WTO Law and maintains close ties to research carried out within the NCCR Trade Regulation. In addition to the resident faculty, the MILE Programme invites leading practitioners and experts from law firms, international organisations, policy research institutes and top universities to lecture and train students. The MILE student body is both multidisciplinary and multinational in character, with the annual intake of 35 to 40 students typically representing over 25 countries. Many MILE students have prior training or professional experience in the field of international trade. The programme is an intensive academic year of interdisciplinary learning with emphasis on the acquisition of practical skills in trade diplomacy and policy analysis. The WTIs Summer Academy addresses issues of trade regulation to professionals, NGO and government officials, scholars and students. Each year the programme covers topics in the field of international trade by providing lectures, tutorials, practical exercises or simulations lead by academics and practitioners, the majority of whom are drawn from the ranks of the MILE faculty. Students take part in a multicultural, interdisciplinary environment and establish contacts with professionals from all over the world. The programmes field trip to Geneva and other extracurricular activities are integral to the Summer Academy. The WTI offers a Distance Learning Programme providing activities aimed at bridging the knowledge gap and redressing existing negotiation asymmetries between developed and developing countries. E-learning and training allows students to access the expertise, information and knowledge available at the World Trade Institute without spending study time abroad. Flexible interaction with experts, tutors, WTI academic staff and other participants via the internet allows participants to efficiently maximise study time. The Distance Learning Programme aims to provide knowledge of the contemporary legal framework governing the world trading system and is designed for public and private sector professionals, academics, civil society leaders as well as interested students who wish to broaden their knowledge base in the field of trade regulation. The WTI has delivered tailor-made courses on subjects as diverse as trade and agriculture, contingency protection, trade in financial services, investment rule-making, WTO dispute settlement and many other topics falling within the broader perimeter of trade rule-making.
