Polar (original release) PolyGram (1992 - 1997) "Like an Angel Passing Through My Room" by ABBA is the closing track from the group's final studio album, The Visitors. It was written by Benny Andersson and Bjrn Ulvaeus. Work began on this track on 26 May, 1981 in Polar Music Studios. [1] At first, the track was given the title, "Another Morning Without You". In later recording sessions it was re-titled "An Angel Walked Through My Room", "An Angel's Passing Through My Room" and also "Twinkle Twinkle". At one point the song was turned into a disco track but this idea was eventually abandoned as the group felt it sounded too similar to "Lay All Your Love on Me".[2] Initially the track featured vocal parts from both Agnetha Fltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad but the final version of the song featured Anni-Frid as soloist. It is the only ABBA song to feature just one vocalist. [3] Unlike many other ABBA songs, the final mix of the track was sparsely produced - the entire track consisting of the soloist's treated vocals, synthesized strings, and a music box melody (also synthesized). The sound of a ticking clock, also heard throughout the track, was produced by Andersson's MiniMoog. The designer of the album sleeve for The Visitors, Rune Sderqvist, was partly inspired by this song's theme when he conceived the idea of photographing the group standing before Julius Kronberg's painting of an angelic-looking Eros.[4] On April 23rd 2012 a Deluxe version of The Visitors was released. One of its bonus tracks was a demo medley of 'Like an Angels Passing Through My Room' called 'From A Twinkling Star To A Passing Angel' put together by Benny Andersson, who feels that the song is one of the best that he and Bjrn wrote during the ABBA years, but is uncertain whether the final version is the ultimate one. His view is shared by Agnetha Fltskog who described listening to the song as waiting for something that never comes. The compilation showed the experimentation of ABBA with the track, ranging from a full-tempo version (featuring the famous ABBA harmonies) that was later abandoned because it sounded too much like something ABBA had already recorded, to a rather sober synthesized version close to the version that was eventually released. Early lyrics resembled the traditional 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star', although these lyrics were meant as temporary to accompany the melody. Benny was also involved in Anne Sofie von Otter's version of this song which was released on her album with Elvis Costello, "For the Stars" in 2000.
