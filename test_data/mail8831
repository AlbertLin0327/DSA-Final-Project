The Marquess of Shn (?  771 BCE) (Chinese: ; pinyin: Shn Hu) was a ruler of the State of Shn during the Zhu Dynasty period of Chinese history. A vassal state of the Zhu Kings, Shn state covered the area of modern day Nanyang City in Henan Province. One of the Marquess of Shn's daughters married King Yu. As Queen Shn, she gave birth to Crown Prince Yji before Bo S persuaded the king to banish Queen Shn and make her own son, Bf, crown prince. Furious at the treatment of his daughter and grandson, the Marquess of Shn allied with the State of Zng (/) along with Qunrng nomads to attack the Zhu capital at Hojng. King Yu lit beacons to summon his nobles in defence, but none came and he was subsequently killed at the foot of Lshn near modern day X'n. Thereafter, the Marquesses of Shn and Zng, together with Marquess Wn of X enthroned Yji as King Ping of Zhu in the State of Shn.[1][2] This marked the end of the Western Zhu Dynasty and the beginning of the Eastern Zhu Dynasty. The Marquess of Shn died in 771 BCE.
