Maria di Rohan is a melodramma tragico, or tragic opera, in three acts by Gaetano Donizetti. The Italian libretto was written by Salvadore Cammarano, after Lockroy and Edmond Badon's Un duel sous le cardinal de Richelieu, which had played in Paris in 1832. It premiered at the Krntnertortheater, Vienna on June 5, 1843. The comte de Chalais, lover of Marie de Rohan, intercedes with the king, Louis XIII, to save the life of the duc de Chevreuse, condemned to death for having killed in a duel a nephew of Cardinal Richelieu. But Chalais discovers that Marie has secretly married the duke, when he takes part in a duel with Armand de Gondi. And Chevreuse, deciding to replace his benefactor in the duel, discovers that his friend has been the lover of his wife.
