Gracie and Zarkov were pseudonymous sexual pioneers of dimethyltryptamine and other psychedelic tryptamines.[1][2] Their experiences were documented in Notes from Underground. According to Sisters of the Extreme: Women Writing on the Drug Experience, Gracie's name was chosen in homage to Gracie Allen, Grace Slick, and the "gratuitous grace" that Huxley found in the psychedelic experience.[3] 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
