Rogue Status is a clothing company based in Los Angeles. Created by designers Johan Esbensen and Rex Holloway in 2005, it was soon endorsed by celebrity investors Travis Barker and Rob Dyrdek and Scott Emmer. Profits from the clothing line go across seas to American soldiers so they can send out letters to their friends and family. The brand mostly features printed t-shirts and uses controversial designs in order to generate response and dialogue. Their most recognizable "Gun Show" print features the silhouettes of a variety of firearms grouped together to form parallel stripes. Products also include sweatshirts, shorts and other accessories, such as backpacks, belts, and wallets. Rogue Status also owns its own drift team which competes across the USA.
