Michael Brent Abernathy (born September 23, 1977 in Atlanta, Georgia) is a former professional baseball infielder. He played in the major leagues from 2001 to 2003, and again in 2005. He was awarded the Dial Award for the national high-school scholar-athlete of the year in 1995. Abernathy was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the second round of the 1996 Major League Baseball Draft. In 2000, he was traded to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for pitchers Steve Trachsel and Mark Guthrie. He played for the gold-medal winning United States team in the 2000 Olympics, and went on to make his debut in the majors with Tampa Bay and later played with the Kansas City Royals and the Minnesota Twins. He has not been in the majors since 2005. Brent was the sole Tampa Bay Devil Rays player to reach base against the Boston Red Sox on April 27, 2002, on a walk. This plate appearance broke up Derek Lowe's bid for a perfect game. Lowe did finish the game, however, with a no-hitter. On April 7, 2008, Abernathy signed with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League. His last season in professional baseball was 2009, when he played with the Camden Riversharks.
