Captain David James Hughes (born 16 April 1899, date of death unknown) was a World War I flying ace credited with five aerial victories.[1] When Hughes completed pilot's training, he became an instructor for a while. He was then assigned to 3 Squadron to operate a Sopwith Camel. He ran up a total of two enemy airplanes destroyed, two driven down out of control, and one captured, between 8 August and 23 October 1918.[2] Above the Trenches: a Complete Record of the Fighter Aces and Units of the British Empire Air Forces 1915-1920.
