The Mansi language (also Vogul, although this is obsolete, and "Maansi") is a language of the Mansi people. It is spoken in territories of Russia along the Ob River and its tributaries, including the KhantyMansi Autonomous Okrug and the Sverdlovsk Oblast. According to the 1989 census, there were 3,184 Mansi-speaking people in Russia. The base dialect of the Mansi literary language is the Sosva dialect, a representative of the northern dialect; the discussion below is based on the standard language. Fixed word order is typical in Mansi. Adverbials and participles play an important role in sentence construction. The written language was first published in 1868 and in 1937 was revised using a form of Cyrillic. The Mansi language is subdivided into four main dialects which are to a large degree mutually unintelligible, and therefore best considered four languages. Northern Mansi (Sosva, Upper Lozyvin) has strong Russian, Komi, Nenets, and Northern Khanty influence. There is no accusative case; that is, both the nominative and accusative roles are unmarked on the noun. *// and *// have been backed to [a] and [a]. Western Mansi (Pelym, Vagily, Middle and Lower Lazyvin) went extinct ca. 2000. It had strong Russian and Komi influences. Long vowels were diphthongized. Eastern Mansi (Kondin) is spoken by 100200 people. It has Khanty and Tatar influence. There is vowel harmony, and for *// it has [], frequently diphthongized. Southern Mansi (Tavdin) went extinct ca. 1900. It had vowel harmony and a strong Tatar influence and displayed several archaisms such as retention of /y/ (elsewhere merged with *//), /ts/ (elsewhere deaffricated to /s/), and /a/ (elsewhere raised to /o/). The first publication of the written Mansi language was a translation of the Gospel of Matthew published in London in 1868. In 1932 a version of Latin alphabet was introduced with little success. The former Latin alphabet: In 1937, Cyrillic replaced the Latin. Mansi is an agglutinating, SOV language.[2] There are two articles in Mansi: definite  (a), which also means "now" when placed before verbs, and indefinite  (ak), literally "one".[3] There is no grammatical gender. Mansi distinguishes between singular, dual and plural number. Six grammatical cases exist. Possession is expressed using possessive suffixes, for example -, which means "my". Example with:  /put/ (cauldron) Missing cases can be expressed using postpositions, such as  (alnl, 'of, out of'),  (sait, 'after, behind'), etc. Mansi conjugation has three persons, three numbers, two tenses, and four moods. Active and passive voices exist. Intransitive and transitive conjugations are distinguished. This means that there are two possible ways of conjugating a verb. When the speaker conjugates in intransitive, the sentence has no concrete object (in this case, the object is nothing or something like something, anything). In the transitive conjugation, there is a concrete object. This feature also exists in the other Ugric languages. Mansi uses suffixes to express the tense. The tense suffix precedes the personal suffix. The language has no future tense; the future is expressed in other ways. There are four moods: indicative, conditional, imperative and precative. Indicative mood has no suffix. Imperative mood exists only in the second person. The suffixes are the following: Thus, the conjugation of the verb  (lat. mina [go]), in past tense (remember the suffix -): Verbs have active and passive voice. Active voice has no suffix; the suffix to express the passive is --. Verbal prefixes are used to modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways. For example, with the prefix - (el-) (away, off) the verb  (mina) (go) becomes  (elmina), which means to go away. This is surprisingly close to the Hungarian equivalents: el- (away) and menni (to go), where elmenni is to go away l(a)  'forwards, onwards, away' ot  'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity' Numbers 1 and 2 also have attributive forms:  (1) and  (2); compare with Hungarian kt, and Old Hungarian "kit").    .  I went fishing (literally "I fish catch went"). Here are some invented sentences in Northern Mansi (IPA transcription) and Hungarian. They demonstrate well the relationship between Hungarian and Mansi.
