Content:
T mesons are hypothetical mesons composed of a top quark and either an up (T0 ), down (T+ ), strange (T+ s) or charm antiquark (T0 c).[1] Because of the top quark's short lifetime, T mesons are not expected to be found in nature. The combination of a top quark and top antiquark is not a T meson, but rather toponium. Each T meson has an antiparticle that is composed of a top antiquark and an up (T0 ), down (T ), strange (T s) or charm quark (T0 c) respectively.
