S.A.G.A.P.O. was the Greek entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2002, performed in English by Michalis Rakintzis. Officially, this was the first occasion on which the Greek entry had not featured any lyrics in Greek, however the title is a transcription of the phrase "I Love You" in Greek, "S'agapo". The song was performed fourth on the night (following Austria's Manuel Ortega with "Say A Word" and preceding Spain's Rosa with "Europe's Living A Celebration"). At the close of voting, it had received 27 points, placing 17th in a field of 24. Michalis and his backing singers were all dressed in black, robotic outfits, for their Eurovision appearance. The song deals with the surest way to cheer Rakintzis up, for his lover to tell him how she feels about him. This is described as being "the password" throughout the lyrics. It was succeeded as Greek representative at the 2003 Contest by Mando with Never Let You Go.
