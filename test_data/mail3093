Misplaced Childhood is the third studio album of the neo-progressive rock band Marillion. It was released in 1985 and has been their most commercially successful album, reaching number one in the UK album charts in June 1985 and spending a total of 41 weeks on the chart, the longest chart residency of a Marillion album. [1] The album features the band's two most successful singles, the guitar-led "Kayleigh", which reached No. 2 in the UK and was a worldwide success, and the piano-led "Lavender", which reached No. 5. The name Kayleigh was devised by Fish to slightly obscure the name of a former girlfriend named "Kay Lee" (with "Lee" being the middle name), whom the song was mostly about. Misplaced Childhood was the band's first full concept album, consisting of two continuous pieces of music on the two sides of the vinyl. In live concerts preceding the album, Fish had originally claimed as a teaser that the next album would consist of only two tracks, 'Side One' and 'Side Two'. Then, during the Misplaced Childhood tour, Fish would announce "Now there is time for one more track... the name of the track is 'Misplaced Childhood'", and the band performed the entire album in sequence. The story has thematic elements of lost love, sudden success, acceptance, and lost childhood, along with an upbeat ending. As Fish explains, he conceived the concept during a 10-hour acid trip.[2] Several of the songs and titles contain notable autobiographical references; one example is that track 2 ("Kayleigh") references past girlfriends. Another example is track 5 ("I was born with the heart of Lothian"), which is a reference to a traditional region of Scotland - Fish himself being from Midlothian - and a reference to the Heart of Midlothian (Royal Mile) - a mosaic heart in the pavement of Edinburgh's Royal Mile. A 2-CD remastered version with additional B-sides and demos was released in 1998. The album was originally released on Cassette, vinyl LP, 12" Picture Disc and CD. In 1998, as part of a series of Marillion's first eight studio albums, EMI re-released Misplaced Childhood with remastered sound and a second disc containing bonus material, listed above. The remastered edition was later also made available without the bonus disc. The album contains several references to song titles or lyrics by Marillion and other artists. These include: The boy on the front cover is Robert Mead, then a ten-year-old who lived next door to the sleeve artist Mark Wilkinson. Mead also appeared in the video for "Kayleigh" and was portrayed on the sleeves for all three of the singles taken from the album, "Kayleigh", "Lavender" and Heart of Lothian. The album topped the 1985 readers' poll for best album in Sounds magazine and came sixth in Kerrang! magazine's Albums Of The Year 1985.[4] The album came fourth in Classic Rock's list of the 30 greatest concept albums of all time. [5] In the Q & Mojo Classic Special Edition Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock, the album came #17 in its list of "40 Cosmic Rock Albums". [6] The album was the inspiration for comedian Will Smiths Edinburgh Fringe show Misplaced Childhood in 2005, which also led to a successful tour in 2006.
