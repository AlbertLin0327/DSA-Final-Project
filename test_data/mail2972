Follow the Boys is a 1963 comedy film. Directed by Richard Thorpe and shot on location on the French and Italian Riviera, Follow the Boys was MGM's second film vehicle for its label's top recording artist Connie Francis following 1960's Where the Boys Are. While Francis role in the earlier film had been somewhat secondary she had a distinctly central role in Follow the Boys playing Bonnie Pulaski, a newlywed traveling the Riviera visiting ports-of-call in hopes of a rendezvous with her naval officer husband (Roger Perry) who was summoned to active duty from their honeymoon. Missing the original point and time of rendezvous in the port of Nice by a few minutes, Bonnie Pulaski follows the ship to Italy in a somewhat rickety and battered pink 2 CV accompanied by veteran navy wife Janis Paige and two sailors' girlfriends - played by Francis' Where the Boys Are co-star Paula Prentiss and by Dany Robin - likewise intent on romantic reunions. Happy endings for each of the ladies are delayed by a series of romantic and comedic misunderstandings. Paige's husband is played by Ron Randell, Richard Long and Russ Tamblyn are the respective love interests for Robin and Prentiss. Follow the Boys was the first instance of Prentiss and her husband Richard Benjamin performing in the same screen production although Benjamin's part as Aide to the Admiral did not make the final cut.
