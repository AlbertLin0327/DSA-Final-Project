Giovanni Urbani (March 26, 1900  September 17, 1969) was an Italian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Patriarch of Venice from 1958 until his death, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1958. He was considered to be overly dependent upon his advisers.[1] Giovanni Urbani was born in Venice to Angelo and Elisabetta (ne Borghi) Urbani, and was an artilleryman during World War I.[2] After studying at the Patriarchal Seminary, he was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Pietro La Fontaine on September 24, 1922. Urbani then did pastoral work in Venice until 1925, furthered his studies for a year, and taught at the seminary from 1927 to 1945. He was raised to the rank of Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness on November 12, 1936, and later Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on June 5, 1943. On October 26, 1946, he was appointed Titular Bishop of Axomis. Urbani received his episcopal consecration on the following December 8 from Cardinal Adeodato Giovanni Piazza, OCD, with Bishops Giovanni Jeremich and Carlo Zinato serving as co-consecrators, in St. Mark's Basilica. Until 1955, he served as secretary and national counselor of Azione Cattolica's Central Commission, which included instructing Italian parishes against Communism.[3] Urbani was promoted to Titular Archbishop of Sardes on November 27, 1948, and was later made Bishop of Verona, with the personal title of "Archbishop", on April 14, 1955. Pope John XXIII named Urbani to succeed him as Patriarch of Venice on November 11, 1958. He was the first native Venetian to become Patriarch since Cardinal Ludovico Flangini Giovanelli (18011804), and was created Cardinal-Priest of S. Prisca by Pope John in the consistory of December 15 of that same year. His cardinalatial title was later changed to Cardinal Priest of S. Marco on March 19, 1962. From 1962 to 1965, the Cardinal attended the Second Vatican Council. He was also one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1963 papal conclave, which selected Pope Paul VI. Because of his moderate views, Urbani was widely seen as papabile at the conclave.[4] In 1964, he prohibited Venetian priests and nuns from attending the Venice Biennale due to the nudism in its exhibitions.[5] Urbani died from a heart attack in Venice, at age 69.[4] He is buried in St. Mark's Basilica.
