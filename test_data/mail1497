Fallout was the debut album released by The Mayfield Four, an American rock band. The album spawned two singles: "Don't Walk Away" and "Always." "Inner City Blues" is a cover of a Marvin Gaye song, "Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)." This album features a much more soul-influenced sound than their second album, Second Skin, which moved the band's music into a more hard rock direction. All songs written and composed by Myles Kennedy.
