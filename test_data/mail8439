Content:
The ERM protein family consists of three closely related proteins, ezrin,[2] radixin[3] and moesin.[4][5] The three paralogs, ezrin, radixin and moesin, are present in vertebrates whereas other species have only one ERM gene. Therefore, in vertebrates these paralogs likely arose by gene duplication.[6] ERM proteins are highly conserved throughout evolution . More than 75% identity is observed in the N-terminal and the C-terminal of vertebrates (ezrin, radixin, moesin), Drosophila (dmoesin) and C. elegans (ERM-1) homologues.[7] ERM molecules contain the following three domains:[5] Ezrin, radixin and merlin also contain a polyproline region between the central helical and C-terminal domains. ERM proteins crosslink actin filaments with plasma membranes. They co-localize with CD44 at actin filament-plasma membrane interaction sites, associating with CD44 via their N-terminal domains and with actin filaments via their C-terminal domains.[5][8] ERM proteins are highly regulated proteins. They exist in two forms[6][7]: In culture cells, ERM proteins mainly exhibit the folded conformation (about 80-85%[9]). The current model for ERM proteins activation is a two-steps mechanism:[10]
