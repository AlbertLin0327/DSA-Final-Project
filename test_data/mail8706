Zina Garrison-Jackson was the defending champion but did not compete that year. Meredith McGrath won in the final 26, 64, 64 against Nathalie Tauziat. A champion seed is indicated in bold text while text in italics indicates the round in which that seed was eliminated. The top eight seeds received a bye to the second round.
