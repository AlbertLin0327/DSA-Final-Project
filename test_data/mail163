The Kansas Motorcycle Museum is a historic motorcycle museum in Marquette, Kansas on the southeast corner of Washington (the main drag) and Third Street in downtown Marquette. The museum was founded in 2003 by racer Stan Engdahl, a native of Marquette who died in 2007, and features over 100 vintage and rare motorcycles of all various makes and models as well as numerous other motorcycle memorabilia and artifacts. "Stan the Man" Engdahl was a motorcycle racing legend and five time National Racing Champion. Stan's wife LaVona currently serves as curator of the museum. Admission is free, but donations are welcome. The museum is open year-round and most holidays. The museum is a popular biker destination.[1]
