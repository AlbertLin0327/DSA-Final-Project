Coordinates: 402633N 795715W / 40.442583N 79.954033W / 40.442583; -79.954033 Hillman Library is the largest library and the center of administration for the University Library System (ULS) of the University of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States.[1] Located on corner of Forbes Avenue and Schenley Drive diagonally across from the Cathedral of Learning, Hillman serves as the flagship of the approximately 6.2 million-volume University Library System at Pitt.[2] The University Library System (ULS) is the University of Pittsburgh's largest library organization and is administered by the Hillman University Librarian and Director, ULS.[1] The organization in its current form dates back to 1982, when the University combined the administration of its libraries for the Graduate Schools of Business, Public and International Affairs, and the School of Library and Information Sciences with that of the Hillman Library and its branches. From the early 1980s the library system adopted many new services and resources alongside the evolution of computer technology including, most notably, the installation and unveiling of its first online catalog based on the NOTIS integrated library system.[3] In addition to the Hillman Library, the ULS includes the following libraries and collections on the Pittsburgh campus:[4] The Library Resource Facility, located three miles from the heart of the Pittsburgh campus, houses many of the ULS' back-office operations in addition to the Archives Service Center and the Library Collections Storage Unit, a high-density book storage facility with a capacity of 2.7 million volumes.[5] The libraries on the University's four regional campuses at Bradford, Greensburg, Johnstown, and Titusville also belong to the ULS.[1] A member of the Association of Research Libraries,[6] the ULS ranks 23rd out of the ARL's 126 member libraries, placing it in the top 20% of North America's largest academic libraries.[7] The ULS has been commended for its use of technology, including the digitization of its unique collection and improving the accessibility of its online resources. Duane Webster, executive director emeritus of the Association of Research Libraries, notes that the ULS has "transformed not only [its own] school's library but also the future of research libraries."[8] The ULS has also been noted for its publication of new digital content[9] in its D-Scribe Digital Publishing program.[7] The ULS partners with other University of Pittsburgh libraries including the Barco Law Library and the Health Sciences Library System, both located on the Pittsburgh campus. The ULS shares a single online system with these partner libraries, collaborates with them to provide facilitated access to all collections, and cooperates on other projects to serve the University.[10] Hillman Library was built on land that had bordered Forbes Field and was donated in the 1950s to Pitt by coal magnate John H. Hillman, Jr. When Forbes Field was razed in 1971, three other buildings were planned as a cluster for the site: Wesley W. Posvar Hall, David L. Lawrence Hall, and the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. Design of Hillman Library was led by Celli-Flynn and Associates who served as coordinating architects.[11] Kuhn, Newcomer & Valentour served as associated architects with Harrison & Abramovitz acting as consulting architects to the university.[12] Dolores Miller and Associates consulted on the interior design, and Keyes Metcalf served as a library consultant.[13] Constructed began in June 1965,[14] and the library opened on January 8, 1968,[15] while its formal dedication was held on September 6, 1968.[16] It is named for John H. Hillman, Jr. Both the Hillman family and the Hillman Foundation gave millions toward its construction. The facade consisting of Indiana Limestone alternated with rows of Max Abramovitz designed the oriel windows. The floor-to-ceiling windows were placed at a bay window angle in order to be inconspicuous on the plane surface of the outer wall while still providing light.[17] With five floors, seating for 1,539 students, and holding 1.9 million volumes, Hillman is the largest of the 17 libraries on the Pitt campus. In 1996, architect Celli-Flynn and Associates and Kuhn, Newcomer & Valentour won the Timeless Award for Enduring Design from the Pittsburgh chapter of the American Institute of Architects for its design of Hillman Library.[18][19] Hillman Library contains many different collections and reading spaces. Among them are: [1] A rotating selection of John James Audubon prints from the university's copy of The Birds of America, one of only 120 complete collections in existence, is on view in the librarys ground floor display case. Individual plates from this collection are exhibited for two weeks at a time in order of plate number.[21] Many other graphic and sculptural works are nestled among the stairways and study areas on the buildings upper floors, some of which are on loan from the Carnegie Museum of Art. Several works of Virgil Cantini are in the library, including a wood and metal sculpture of an arrow-pierced St. Sebastian, located in the first floor stairwell, and a wooden sculpture of the Virgin Mary holding a lamb.[22] Flanking the wall opposite the first floor reference desk are two abstract works: Modern Warfare by Kes Zapkus and Arcing Light by Albert Stadler. A large bust of Confucius by Chinese artist Li Guangyu and a stone sculpture, The Sound of Autumn, by Masayuki Nagare are on the second floor. Near the special collections reading room on the third floor is a selection of early 20th century illustrations in watercolor, charcoal and crayon created to accompany the work of mystery writer Mary Roberts Rinehart. Also on the third floor are works by winners of the A.J. Schneider Studio Arts Award, selected from among entries in the annual student exhibition. Winners agree to allow their work to be displayed for one year in the reading room.[2] In addition, a folk music concert series entitled The Emerging Legends Series is performed in The Cup & Chaucer caf on the ground floor of Hillman Library. The series, a collaboration between the University of Pittsburgh Library System and Calliope: The Pittsburgh Folk Music Society, is free and open to the public.[23][24] Tony Smith's 1971 painted steel sculpture Light Up! can be found outside Hillman library in Forbes Quad between the library and Posvar Hall.[3] 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics track and field 800-meter gold medalist John Woodruff, a 1939 alumnus of the University of Pittsburgh, donated his gold medal to the university in 1990. Woodruff insisted on it being displayed in the university's library where it would be appreciated not just as an athletic achievement, but in its social and historical context.[27] For years the medal was displayed in an inconspicuous location on the ground floor of Hillman Library.[28] Woodruff's 800 m win in the 1936 games was the first for an African American in front of Adolf Hitler and was achieved in what has been called "the most daring move seen on a track" when he stopped in mid-race in order to break out of a pack of runners and then retook the lead in a sprint to the finish, thereby becoming the first American to achieve gold in 800 m in 24 years.[29] In 2008, the medal was removed for loan to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., where it was part of the exhibit "State of Deception: The Power of Nazi Propaganda."[30] After the medal's return to the university, it was placed in a new, six-foot tall wood-and-glass display on the first floor of the library. The display was unveiled during a dedication ceremony on October 14, 2011, in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of Woodruff's win. The medal, appraised at $250,000,[27] is securely housed under bulletproof glass on a rotating illuminated pedestal. The display also contains interactive multi-media content including a touchscreen that features film narratives, a photo gallery, and selections of the Woodruff family's personal scrapbook.[31] Hillman Library is a primary setting for The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, a novel by Pitt alumnus Michael Chabon, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2001.
