Weymouth Quay is a disused[4] railway station in Weymouth, Dorset, England at the terminus of the Weymouth Harbour Tramway. Until September 1987 it was the regular terminus and starting point for boat trains, linking to the ferry services with street running along the streets of the town. After the regular boat trains were ended, the station was still occasionally used for special services, the last being a Pathfinder railtour on 2 May 1999.[3] The track and station are no longer used at all, although they are still part of the rail network. The station buildings are now offices for Condor Ferries which operates a ferry service to the Channel Islands. The line was designated "Out of Use (temporary)" for a period of 2 years by Network Rail on 15 January 2007,[5] and again on 1 April 2009.[6] Closure of the branch has been proposed by Weymouth and Portland Borough Council, who are proposing to acquire the trackbed.[7] Coordinates: 503631N 22654W / 50.60863N 2.44828W / 50.60863; -2.44828
