Tony Tenser (10 August 1920  5 December 2007[1]) was an English-born film producer of Lithuanian-Jewish descent. He specialised in producing Exploitation film movies and founded his own production company Tigon British Film Productions in 1966, which also made more mainstream films such as Witchfinder General and other horror films. He was also responsible for producing Roman Polanski's first two films in English, Repulsion and Cul-de-sac.
