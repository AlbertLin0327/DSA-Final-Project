Cebu based airline, Mid-SEA Express (MSE). Started as air charter operator and non-scheduled air taxi headquartered at Mactan-Cebu International Airport in Lapu-Lapu City in Central Visayas, in the Philippines. Its slogan is "Bridging the islands". The airline will be operating from two main bases; Mactan-Cebu International Airport in Cebu and Tagbilaran City Airport in Bohol. Mid-SEA Express (MSE) represents its name as Middle of South East Asia founded by Capt. Ronan D. Villanueva, that started its operation as Island Helicopter Services, that was established in the year 2008. After seeing the need to service the neighboring islands around Cebu, he acquired an aircraft with a Short Take-off Landing Capability, a BN-2A Islander. Starting a daily flight schedule from Cebu to Tagbilaran City, Bohol, then a month after, Cebu Bantayan island was also opened. Then it was successively followed by flights to Camiguin and Siquijor islands. The re-opening of this new routes has further developed its eco-tourism potential and further improved the access not only for the tourist but also for the local Filipino communities. All this air services will further boost its tourist arrival and provide a faster convenient air access. Mid-Sea Express vision of Bridging the Island has been achieved through their consistent adding of unserved routes to both Filipino citizens and foreign travelers alike. The goal of Mid-Sea Express is to further promote the tourism potential of this smaller islands while still serving the routes and destinations that are in high demand. With the large and ever-increasing tourist demand in Bohol, the Cebu-Bohol flights are helping increase the islands chances of making a name among the worlds travelers, just as Boracay recently did in a recent worldwide publication. MSE is now expanding its operation and adding new routes to connect Cebu-Tagbilaran City, Bohol-Davao and Cebu-Bohol, Bohol-Cagayan de Oro, and Cagayan de Oro-Zamboanga, utilizing its new British Aerospace (BAE) Jetstream 32EP. In 2011, the Mid-Sea Express begun operations for non-scheduled air transportation, initially covering Cebu-Tagbilaran as its launching route. It launched an 8-seater Britten-Norman Islander which proved convenient and affordable to passengers in terms of time and cost. Tagbilaran City is a short distance to Mactan City. In the month following its launched, it began flights to Bantayan island in eastern Cebu. Currently, the airline serves six routes. Mid-Sea Express serves the following destinations:
