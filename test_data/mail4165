RayGo was formed in November 1964 by Ray Roettger and Gordon Garis who wanted to provide the construction industry with quality products based on sound engineering practices. The first product was a Rascal Roller introduced in May 1965 and it was an immediate success with subsequent orders coming in from all around the world. Other products were added to the line and RayGo soon had Multi wheel rollers, Tandem Rollers, Single drum rollers, 4 wheel Compactors as well as soil stabilizers and Road Recyclers, A small front end loader and a small grader. Raygo machines were all painted a light green colour which was unusual as most construction machinery was yellow.
