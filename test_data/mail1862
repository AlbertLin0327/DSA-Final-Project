Nocturne is the debut album by American metal band The Human Abstract. It was recorded at The Basement in Rural Hall, North Carolina and Trax East in South River, New Jersey. On the band's MySpace page, as well as in the Metal=Life compilation CD, the last 30 or so seconds of "Desiderata" are included as part of the intro to "Vela, Together We Await The Storm". Music videos were made for "Crossing the Rubicon" and "Vela, Together We Await the Storm". Nocturne has sold roughly 40,000 units in the USA since its release in August 2006'. Meperidine Cathedral, Winter Fevers, and The Science Of Deduction are songs that were featured on the band's four song demo album, along with material that wasn't produced for Nocturne. They were recorded with their previous singer, Nick, and featured different lyrics and vocal melodies. The demo was recorded by Jonny Santos (Spineshank) and Logan Mader (Machine Head, Soulfly).
