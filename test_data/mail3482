State Route 4 marker State Highways in Washington Interstate US State Former PSH 1964 renumbering Former State Route 4, also known as the Ocean Beach Highway, connects U.S. Route 101 at Johnson's Landing, Washington (a few miles west of Naselle) with Interstate 5 in Kelso-Longview. It runs along the north bank of the Columbia River and serves as Washington's counterpart to U.S. Route 30 in Oregon. At Naselle, the spur State Route 401 connects SR 4 south to the AstoriaMegler Bridge. The route was once the western leg of U.S. Route 830, which ran from Johnson's Landing in the west to Maryhill in the east. US 30 and US 830 never intersected. State Route 4 starts at U.S. 101 near the town of Chinook. It then passes by State Route 401 in Naselle. After several miles of trees, SR4 passes by the Deep River, then through Rosburg where a small store, school, and cemetery are located. The route then runs through the towns of Grays River and Skamokawa. The road goes into Cathlamet, the county seat of Wahkiakum County. After Cathlamet, the road turns quite scenic. The Columbia River can be seen from the south, and big Douglas Fir trees to the north. It passes by a little village called Stella, continues through Longview, then ends in Kelso at I-5.  State Route 402 was a proposal for a state route in the U.S. state of Washington. It would have been an auxiliary route of State Route 4. It was plan to start at SR 4 and end at SR 6. In 1964, SSH 12G became SR 402. The proposal for SR 402 was later abandoned in 1971.[2]  State Route 407 was a state route in the U.S. state of Washington. It was an auxiliary route of State Route 4. It started at SR 4 and went east to Elochoman State Forest. In 1964, SSH 12D became SR 407. SR 407 was later removed in 1992.[3]
