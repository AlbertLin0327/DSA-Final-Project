Coordinates: 394344N 1045926W / 39.7288N 104.9906W / 39.7288; -104.9906 Denver Health Medical Center, formerly named Denver General Hospital, was founded in 1860. The name was sometimes abbreviated to Denver General or DG, nicknames that persist in common parlance. It is one of four Level I Trauma Centers in Colorado.[1] The hospital is located near Cherry Creek, in Denver.[2] Denver Health is one of the primary teaching hospitals in Denver and is affiliated with the University of Colorado Denver. Denver Health is an integrated health care system that consists of: Denver's Department of Environmental Health(DEH), a City and County of Denver agency, manages and oversees the operating agreement to contract with Denver Health and Hospital Authority (DHHA) to provide services related to the medical investigations and medical services for disease control (including clinics)and the administration of vital birth and death records. DEH and Denver Public Health work together to conduct communicable disease reporting, investigation, and control for Denver. Public and environmental health functions and regulatory authority remains with DEH. DHHA provides communicable disease surveillance and medically-oriented public health functions through their Denver Public Health (DPH) department. Through numerous grant-funded programs, DPH conducts important research on infectious diseases, including hepatitis surveillance; tuberculosis clinical trials; HIV/AIDS prevention, counseling, testing and treatment; and vaccine trials. Denver General was established in 1860. The hospital was originally founded near 11th and Wazee, but in 1873, a new medical center was built at the corner of 6th Avenue and Cherokee; this is where Denver Health is located to this day.[citation needed] The hospital was well known for founding the first nursing school west of the Mississippi and for being one of the earliest facilities for treating Tuberculosis.[citation needed] The hospital employed many health care visionaries, including, Florence Sabin, who was instrumental in creating a functional Public Health department.[citation needed] On January 1, 1997, Denver General became a quasi-state agency and was renamed Denver Health Medical Center. In 1989 a book was written about The Denver General ER, The Knife and Gun Club, Scenes from an Emergency Room by photographer Eugene Richards which received an Award of Excellence from the American College of Emergency Physicians. The book is a collection of stories taken from the Emergency Room and ambulances.[3] Denver Paramedics is a hospital based paramedic service that is based out of Denver Health. Denver Paramedics are contracted to provide the 911 medical services to The City and County of Denver, The City of Glendale, and Denver International Airport.[4] The Denver Health Paramedic Division has a fleet of 31 ambulances.At peak times Denver Paramedics has 14 Advance Life support Ambulances available, that are staffed by two Paramedics.[5] and 6 Basic Life Support Ambulances available, that are staffed by two Basic EMT's. Denver Paramedics respond to an average of 80,000 calls for service a year, an average of 219 calls a day. More than 46,000 patients are transported to Denver area hospitals a year by Denver Paramedics.[6] The largest number of emergency calls that Denver Paramedics respond to are auto accidents, alcohol intoxication, altered mental status, psychiatric emergencies, falls, chest pain, and shortness of breath, followed by assaults, abdominal pain, seizure, and overdose. Cardiac arrest calls account for one half of one percent of all emergency calls.[7][8][9][10]
