Evgeniy Gabrilovich is a prominent Computer Scientist at Yahoo! Research,[1] specializing in Information Retrieval, Machine Learning, and Computational Linguistics, and a Senior Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). In 2002, Gabrilovich published a research paper documenting the possibility of an IDN homograph attack, with fellow researcher Alex Gontmakher. In 2005, Gabrilovich earned his PhD degree in Computer Science from the Technion  Israel Institute of Technology. In his Ph.D. thesis, he developed a methodology for using large scale repositories of world knowledge, such as Wikipedia, as a basis for improvement of text representations. On November 6, 2007, Gabrilovich was granted a US patent for a new method for personalizing newsfeeds, via an analysis of information novelty and dynamics. Later that year, Gabrilovich also published, together with Prof. Shaul Markovitch, a series of articles suggesting a possible synergy between Wikipedia and Artificial Intelligence.
