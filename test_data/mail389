"And No Matches" is a single by German techno group Scooter. It was released as the second single from their 2007 album Jumping All Over The World. The And No Matches music video features the Sheffield Jumpers performing Jumpstyle to the chorus while shots of H.P. Baxxter comprise the lyrical parts of the music video.
