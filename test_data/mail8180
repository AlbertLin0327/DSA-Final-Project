Sultan Abdulmajeed Al-Hebshi (born 31 January 1985) is a Saudi Arabian shot putter. His personal best was set at the 2009 Doha meeting, throwing a new area record of 21.13m and finishing in third, only behind Olympic champion Tomasz Majewski and World Champion Reese Hoffa.[1] http://www.iaaf.org/athletes/biographies/country=ksa/athcode=184926/index.html
