Dee Shipman is a songwriter who has worked with Charles Aznavour and Petula Clark, with whom she wrote the 1990 West End musical Someone Like You. Dee Shipman began her professional career as an actress and singer, both in the theatre, and on TV, where she appeared in series such as The Avengers (Propellant 23) and Emergency - Ward 10. She then went on to a very successful career in radio, including co-presenting a weekly series for the BBC Teen Scene, and having two series of her own for Radio Luxembourg Ready Steady Radio and Kids Like Us. During this period Dee was signed to Decca Records, and released a single of Mel Torms classic "Comin Home Baby!" Dee also wrote for the magazine Pop Weekly, in which she had her own weekly column. As a singer, Dee recorded a twelve track LP that was produced by Norman Newell. The album featured such evergreen standards as "What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?", "The Way You Look Tonight" and "One Hand, One Heart". The album was finally released in July 2008 by Stage Door Records. Titled 'She Isn't Me' the album concludes with a new recording from Dee Shipman and Roger Webb's musical 'Emma'. Dee has made several films, which included starring as Mrs. Burke in the 1972 motion picture Burke And Hare opposite Harry Andrews and Derren Nesbitt, and which Dee described as Glamorous no! Culture no! But fun? YES! Dee first started writing lyrics when she began her song-writing collaboration with composer Roger Webb. Their considerable output included writing "Sad Song Lady" for Blossom Dearie, "The Rainbow Bridge" for Danny Williams and "Making It By Myself" for the Kenneth Tynan and Clifford Williams musical Carte Blanche at the Phoenix Theatre in London ... the show wasnt well reviewed - but the song got rave notices! Dee and Roger also composed music and lyrics for three musical concepts A Kid For Two Farthings (based on the 1955 film of the Wolf Mankowitz modern classic story); The Last Touring Love Show; and Emma (based on the life of Emma Hamilton). Dee went on to write songs with Marc Wilkinson (for the nude review Carte Blanche, 1976),[1] Werner Becker, George Garvarentz, Albert Van Dam, Ralph Lewin, and Herbert Chappell. In 1976, Dee began a very important partnership with Charles Aznavour, which still continues. Their songwriting partnership produced the Aznavour cult favourite "Pretty Shitty Days" as well as "A Very Private Christmas" and "You Make Me Hungry For Your Loving" amongst many others. It was Aznavour who introduced Dee to Petula Clark, and Dee and Petula wrote their first song together in 1978, and have been friends and partners since then. The Clark  Shipman partnership produced the original stage musical Someone Like You which toured the United Kingdom and transferred to the West End in 1990. Dee and Clark have also written over 50 songs together for Clarks commercial albums and singles plus their second, uncompleted musical Zola, based on the life of Emile Zola. Two songs from the score can be heard on the CD In Her Own Write, released by Sepia Records in 2007. In 1989, while continuing to write all Aznavours English lyrics, and also working on two musicals with Clark, Dee wrote the script and co-produced the TV docudrama Petain, charting the life of Philippe Ptain. The film featured Harry Andrews as Petain, in his last film role. (Portions of the film's score, composed by Clark, can be heard on In Her Own Write.) Aznavour and Dee together also devised and wrote the songs for a musical workshop of Molly Bloom's soliloquy from James Joyces Ulysses, which was performed at the Edinburgh International Festival by Eartha Kitt. Charles Aznavours musical Lautrec, with English lyrics by Dee, premiered at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth in March 2000 before transferring to the Shaftesbury Theatre, London. Currently Charles and Dee are working together on several new songs to be included in a US and Canadian production of the show. Dee is an NLP (Neuro-linguistic programming) Master Coach, Trainer, and Master Practitioner, and is a partner with Paul Jacobs in New Oceans. Together they run regular Life, Business, Education, Coaching, and Performing & Creative Arts trainings, workshops, and seminars, and are also extremely successful life coaches. In 2006, Dee and Wes McGhee co-wrote the CD NLP Songs For Change, a unique musical introduction to the tools and techniques of NLP. Dee has also written three books of short stories, based on her NLP experiences:- The Sunbeam Collection Vol.1, The Sunbeam Collection Vol.2, and All We Are Is Our Stories. Vol.1. Dee is currently writing Volume 2. of All We Are , and also The Book Of Inspirational Parenting.
