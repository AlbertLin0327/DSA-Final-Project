United Express Flight 2415 operated by a BAe Jetstream 31 N410UE of North Pacific Airlines on 26 December 1989 was a commuter flight in the United States from Yakima, Washington to Pasco, Washington.[1] The aircraft was approaching Tri-Cities Airport at around 22:30. The crew executed an excessively steep and unstabilized ILS approach. That approach, along with improper air traffic control commands and aircraft icing, caused the aircraft to stall and crash short of the runway. Both crew members and all four passengers were killed.[1]
