El Rancho de las Golondrinas (The Ranch of the Swallows) is a former ranch in the northern part of the U.S. state of New Mexico that has been recreated as a "living museum". Going north it was the last camping place (paraje, cf. caravanserai) on the Camino Real before reaching Santa Fe, New Mexico and a day's journey south of Santa Fe. Today, its 200 acres (0.81km2) is located just north of La Bajada Hill in the Caja del Rio on Los Pinos Road about 12mi (19km) southwest of the Santa Fe city limits. The ranch was founded by Miguel Vega y Coca in 1710.[2] The "living museum" recreates 18th Century Spanish colonial ranch life.[3] Guides are dressed in period clothing and demonstrate how people lived for example grinding their own flour, making their own tools, shoeing horses. There are two annual festivals at El Rancho de las Golondrinas, one in the Spring and one in October.[3] Its acequia system (irrigation ditch complex) is on the Register of Historic Places for New Mexico.[1]
