Mola ramsayi, known commonly as the southern ocean sunfish or southern sunfish, is a fish belonging to the family Molidae. It is closely related to its cogener, the large Mola mola, and is found in the Southern Hemisphere. Mola ramsayi has a relatively small mouth and its teeth fused into a parrot-like beak. It can reach up to 3.3 metres (11ft) in length.[2] Mola ramsayi is found in the Southwest Pacific, especially around Australia and New Zealand and the Southeast Pacific around Chile. Its range also extends to the Southeast Atlantic near South Africa.[3]
