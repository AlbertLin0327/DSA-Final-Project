David John Kinsley Quibell, 1st Baron Quibell (21 December 1879  16 April 1962) was a British builder, contractor and Labour Party politician. Quibell was the son of David John Quibell, of Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, and was educated at the Messingham Church of England School in Lincolnshire. He worked as a builder and contractor.[1] Quibell was elected Member of Parliament for Brigg in Lincolnshire at the 1929 general election. He lost his seat two years later, when Labour split over the decision of its leader, Ramsay Macdonald, to form a National Government, but was re-elected at the 1935 general election. He was a signatory to "Post-war Forest Policy" published by the Forestry Commission in 1943. He retired from the House of Commons at the 1945 general election,[1][2] when he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Quibell, of Scunthorpe in the County of Lincoln,[3] in recognition of his "political and public services".[4] In 1953 he was Mayor of Scunthorpe.[1] Lord Quibell was twice married. He married as his first wife Edith Jane, daughter of J. Foster, in 1900. After her death in March 1953 he married as his second wife Catherine, daughter of J. C. Rae, in 1954. He died in April 1962, aged 83, when the barony became extinct.[1] Quibell's contribution to the Scunthorpe area is remembered for Quibell Park in East Scunthorpe, a venue for the Scunthorpe Family Weekend.[5] The park also contains a cycling stadium.
