The Alveolararterial gradient (Aa gradient), is a measure of the difference between the alveolar concentration of oxygen and the arterial concentration of oxygen. It is used in diagnosing the source of hypoxemia.[1] The equation for calculating the Aa gradient is: Where: In its expanded form, the Aa gradient can be calculated by: On room air ( FiO2=0.21, or 21% ), at sea level ( Patm=760mmHg ) assuming 100% humidity in the alveoli, a simplified version of the equation is: The Aa gradient is useful in determining the source of hypoxemia. The measurement helps isolate the location of the problem as either intrapulmonary (within the lungs) or extrapulmonary (somewhere else in the body). A normal Aa gradient for a young adult non-smoker breathing air, is between 510 mmHg. Normally, the Aa gradient increases with age. For every decade a person has lived, their Aa gradient is expected to increase by 1mmHg. As a quick calculation, a normal Aa gradient is less than the (patient's age divided by 4) + 4. Thus, a 40 year old should have an Aa gradient less than 14. An abnormally increased Aa gradient suggests a defect in diffusion, V/Q (ventilation/perfusion ratio) mismatch, or right-to-left shunt.[3] Because Aa gradient is approximated as: (1505/4(PCO2))PaO2 at sea level (0.21x(760-47) = 149.7 mmHg for the alveolar oxygen partial pressure, after accounting for the water vapor), the direct mathematical cause of a large value is that the blood has a low PO2, a low PCO2, or both. CO2 is very easily exchanged in the lungs and low PCO2 directly correlates with high minute ventilation; therefore a low arterial PCO2 indicates that extra respiratory effort is being used to oxygenate the blood. A low PaO2 indicates that at the patient's current minute ventilation (whether high or normal) is not enough to allow adequate oxygen diffusion into the blood. Therefore the Aa gradient essentially demonstrates a high respiratory effort (low arterial PCO2) relative to the achieved level of oxygenation (arterial PO2). A high Aa gradient could indicate a patient breathing hard to achieve normal oxygenation, a patient breathing normally and attaining low oxygenation, or a patient breathing hard and still failing to achieve normal oxygenation. If lack of oxygenation is proportional to low respiratory effort, then the Aa gradient is not increased; a healthy person who hypoventilates would have hypoxia, but a normal Aa gradient. At an extreme, high CO2 levels from hypoventilation can mask an existing high Aa gradient. This mathematical artifact makes Aa gradient more clinically useful in the setting of hyperventilation.
