A Dark and Stormy (or Dark 'n' Stormy) is an alcoholic highball style cocktail popular in many British Commonwealth countries, such as Bermuda and Australia. It consists of dark rum and ginger beer over ice. It is optionally accompanied by a slice of lime. The local rum is usually used, for example, Goslings in Bermuda or Bundaberg in Australia.[1] In Bermuda, Dark 'n' Stormy is a registered trademark of Gosling's Brothers Limited.[2] It is described as "Bermuda's National Drink",[3] a description often applied to the Rum Swizzle as well.   Bermuda has played host to Australian rugby players in its annual Classic Tournament since the early 1970s.[4] It is popularly believed that following one of these tournaments, the cocktail was brought back to Australia, where it also proved popular.[5] In Queensland, Australia, Bundaberg Distilling Company Pty Ltd, distillers of Bundaberg Rum have produced a pre-mixed version of the Dark and Stormy since 1993. It is sold in stubbies and 375ml cans.[6] The ginger beer component is produced locally by Bundaberg Brewed Drinks Pty Ltd.[7] The Dark N Stormy gained popularity through the sailing community up and down the east coast of the US, having been brought home by various sailors who frequented Bermuda. Most bars in port towns from Portland, ME to Newport, RI to Annapolis, MD and beyond have Dark N Stormy's on their menu, made with various brands of Ginger Beer. While the Dark 'n' Stormy is traditionally made with dark rum, one variation nicknamed the Light 'n' Stormy uses 10 Cane, a light rum. Another variation on the Dark 'n' Stormy, called the Ginger Bush, swaps Rum for Bourbon. When ginger beer is unavailable, beer may be substituted. This is known as a Small Craft Advisory after the National Weather Service severe weather warning. For several years, Gosling's has been a sponsor of the annual yachting regatta Chester Race Week in Chester, Nova Scotia. The Dark 'n' Stormy is the special drink of the night each year, made with ginger beer brewed by local Halifax, NS brewery Propeller Brewery. Rum mixed with ginger wine is a particularly strong combination, known as a Turbo Dark N' Stormy, and is a favourite tipple of Pembroke College Boat Club (Oxford) The definitive NYT article from July 2009
