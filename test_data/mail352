The men's standing high jump was a track and field athletics event held as part of the athletics at the 1912 Summer Olympics programme. It was the fourth and final appearance of the event. The competition was held on Saturday, July 13, 1912. Ray Ewry, who was the three-time defending champion in the event, did not compete in 1912. The silver medalist from 1908, Konstantinos Tsiklitiras, took bronze. Platt Adams, the fifth-place finisher four years earlier, won the event. Benjamin Adams finished second. Each of the three standing high jump medalists also medaled in the standing long jump, though in a different order. Eighteen high jumpers from nine nations competed.
