Sa'adat Abad (Persian:  ) is an affluent neighborhood located North of Shahrak-e Gharb. It is considered as one of the most upscale neighbourhoods of North Tehran. Kaj Square in Saadat Abad, although incomparable with Shahrake Gharb district's Malls, is famous for its large number of restaurants,[citation needed] you can find as many as 30 fast food restaurants and Coffee Shops in a 100 meter Distance heading north and south from Kaj Square. However, shopping for food in Saadat Abad can be a very expensive experience as it houses a large community of wealthy Iranians. North of Kaj, the Saadat Abad Boulevard houses some of the designer label and luxury shops such as Boss,and Villeroy et Boch. Similar designer stores are present further down from Kaj, at the southern end of Saadat Abad Boulevard. Sa'dat Abad has better air quality in comparison to many other Tehran's neighbourhoods, though it has become more congested with traffic in recent years. This area is also close to the Evin district which contains the biggest prison in Iran Evin Prison. Sa'adat Abad also contains the Tehran International School (Boys Section) located in Farhang square. The school consists of three hundred students and is a registered I.B (International Baccalaureate School). Sa'adat Abad once housed the cheapest residential properties in Northern Tehran. However, now property values (especially in the eastern districts of Saadat Abad such as Dashte Behesht) are now on par with that of neighborhoods such as Elahieh, Kamranieh, Farmanieh and Niavaran. Land prices in Saadat Abad have now passed the 40 to 50 million Rials (IRR) per square meter mark, making it one of the most expensive parts of northern Tehran to live in and buy property.
