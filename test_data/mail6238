The locomotives of SD's Class E 426.0 (D's Class 113) are essentially SD Class E 458.0 locomotives redesigned to work from the 1500 V DC overhead wire electrification system. They are retained for use on line 202 from Tbor to Bechyn. When delivered, the class E 426.0 locomotives ran at half the power of an E 458.0, reflecting the lower line voltage. During 1992, 113 002-0 was modified to allow parallel connection of the traction motors. This allowed operation at the full power rating (800kW). Locomotives 113 001-2 and 113 003-8 were similarly modified. The remaining locomotive (113 004-6) has not been modified.[1] Similarly, as improvements were made to the locomotives (and their E 458.0/110 cousins), their maximum speed rating was improved from 50km/h (31mph) to 80km/h (50mph). The line speed on the route to Bechyn is restricted to 60km/h (37mph).[1] The two remaining locomotives (113 005-3 and 113 006-1) are now used as 3000V DC system locomotives. During 2004, they were renumbered as 110 205-2 and 110 206-0 respectively.[1]
