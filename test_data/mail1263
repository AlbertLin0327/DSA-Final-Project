Saint Vincent Academy (SVA), is a four-year, Catholic, college preparatory school for women located on West Market Street in Newark, New Jersey, United States. It operates under the supervision of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark.[4] The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Secondary School since 1990.[2] As of the 2009-10 school year, the school had an enrollment of 310 students in grades 9-12, and 27.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a studentteacher ratio of 11.5.[1] The academy was founded in 1869 by the Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth, and named for St. Vincent de Paul. Saint Vincent Academy currently holds the distinction of being the only private high school for women in the city of Newark in New Jersey. The current administrative team consists of Sister June Favata, S.C., Sr. Margaret Killough, S.C., and Ms. Mary F. Nolan. This school has one of the highest graduation rates of any other schools in Newark and Essex County. [5] Down the street from Saint Vincent Academy is Science Park High School, Essex County College, History High, Saint Benedict's Preparatory School and next to that school is Arts High. Saint Vincent Academy now competes in the Super Essex Conference, following a reorganization of sports leagues in Northern New Jersey by the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA).[6]
