The Kalingarayan Canal is a 90-mile long irrigation canal in the Erode region of Tamil Nadu, India. It was constructed by Kongu chieftain Kalingarayan and completed in the year 1283. This runs parallel to Cauvery River. The canal was designed with a meandering route to maximize the amount of land which benefited. It starts with a minor Dam called Kalingarayan Dam-Reservoir on River Bhavani, near Bhavani and flows through entire Erode and terminates at a place near Kodumudi. Recently the canal has suffered from pollution.[1] In 2007 a 12-crore (120 million) rupee programme to develop the canal was announced, funded by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development.[1] Local farmers have asked for a wall to be built on the right bank, to prevent nearby textile workshops and tanneries from discharging waste. This runs along East of Erode, while the Lower Bhavani Project Canal runs along the west.
