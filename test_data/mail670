The Knockout Stage of the 1994 Federation Cup Americas Zone was the final stage of the Zonal Competition involving teams from the Americas. Those that qualified for this stage placed first, second and third in their respective pools. The twelve teams were then randomly drawn into a two-stage knockout tournament, with the winners qualifying for the World Group. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
