Clitterhouse Recreation Ground or Clitterhouse Playing Fields is a park and Local Nature Reserve[1] in Brent Cross in the London Borough of Barnet. It is a large area of mown grass with a children's playground, bordered by thick hedges. Clitterhouse Stream (or Clitterhouse Brook), a tributary of the River Brent, runs along its eastern border. The 4.5 billion Brent Cross Cricklewood development includes spending several million pounds on improving the park, including extensive landscaping, sports facilities and a nature park.[2][3][4] There is access to the park from Claremont Road, Prayle Grove, Purbeck Drive, Hendon Way, and by a subway from Ridge Hill.
