De Luxe Records was a Linden, New Jersey, United States based record label formed in 1944 by brothers David and Jules Braun. The label flourished in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1947, Syd Nathan, the founder and owner of King Records, purchased a majority interest in De Luxe. In 1949, Nathan moved the label to Cincinnati, Ohio and in 1951 he bought out the Braun brothers completely.[1] Otis Williams and the Charms recorded for De Luxe.
