Newborough is a town in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria, Australia which shares a border to its west, mostly along the Narracan Creek, with the town of Moe. It can be divided into three areas, Old Newborough, East Newborough and North Newborough. The latter two areas were developed by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria in the 1950s as residential housing for workers at the nearby Yallourn coal mining, power generation and briquette making works. Newborough now has a higher than average proportion of retirees and aged residents, and it has been suggested that it owes its generally quiet character to this fact. At the 2006 census, Newborough had a population of 6584. Newborough Post Office opened on 1 October 1942 and Newborough East Post Office opened on 1 March 1951. A Newborough North Post Office opened on 1 July 1965 but was closed a little more than a year later.[2] The town is also home to a vibrant artist community, perhaps drawn by the picturesque Gippsland area and the quiet country lifestyle the town offers. Many artists and crafts partisans have set up small businesses.[3] Newborough is serviced by the Princes Freeway and is within a few kilometres of the Yallourn Power Station and the township of Yallourn North Large sporting events are held locally at the Sports and Recreational Centre on Old Sale Road. The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Mid Gippsland Football League. The town also has 2 Football clubs (Newborough/Yallourn and Monash) competing in the Gippsland Soccer League. Golfers play at the Yallourn Golf Club on Monash Road or the Moe Golf Club on Thompsons Road.[4], both of which adjoin the town. Newborough is the closest town to Lake Narracan, a storage reservoir for the nearby power stations, but also a popular recreational area.
