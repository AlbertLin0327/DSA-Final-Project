[2] This faction, led by Clawster, an extremely durable rock-like entity, repair and utilize machines taking from Warworld to conquer 'Underworld', a society of outcasts living under the streets of Metropolis. They are brought to the attention of Superman when they take over an underground power station and threaten Lois Lane. Clawster is later detained at Project Cadmus, a scientific facility.

Believing it to be a human conspiracy, they arm themselves with the fictional 'Toasmaster' rifles, weapons made by the corrupt company Amertek and designed by John Henry Irons for the military before he left after the weapons fell into the hands of terrorists and were used to kill innocent civilians. Clawster leads an attack Metropolis; the city is already being literally torn apart by various other crises.
