Coordinates: 520426N 12400W / 52.074N 1.400W / 52.074; -1.400 Wroxton is a village and civil parish in the north of Oxfordshire about 3 miles (5km) west of Banbury. Wroxton Abbey is a Jacobean country house on the site of a former Augustinian priory.[2] Wroxton is recorded as having a church in 1217, but the present Church of England parish church of All Saints is early 14th century. A Perpendicular Gothic clerestory and porch were added early in the 15th century. The bell tower was added in 1748, paid for by Lord North, who owned Wroxton Abbey.[3] The tower has a ring of five bells, all cast by Henry I Bagley of Chacombe in 1676.[4] All Saints is now one of eight ecclesiastical parishes in the Ironstone Benefice.[5] The Roman Catholic church of Saint Thomas of Canterbury was built in 1894. It is unusual in having a thatched roof. Goodman Methodist Church was built in 1935. It is a member of Banbury Methodist Circuit. An ironstone quarry northwest of the village was opened in 1917 and worked heavily during the Second World War. It had its own railway, the Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway, that linked it to the Great Western Railway near Banbury. The quarry and its railway closed in 1967. A newer quarry close by is now served by road haulage only. Wroxton has two public houses: the North Arms in Mills Lane controlled by Greene King Brewery[6] and the White Horse Inn on Stratford Road. There is also the Wroxton House Hotel, owned by Best Western.[7] Wroxton Church of England Primary School is in Lampitts Green.[8] Media related to Wroxton at Wikimedia Commons
