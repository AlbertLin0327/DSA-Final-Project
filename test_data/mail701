The Cross Road is a 2008 film written and directed by Alexandra Thompson. Starring Shenae Grimes as Bridget and Garen Boyajian as Salaam, it is the story of love and intolerance. The Cross Road is a modern Romeo and Juliet type of story. The Syrian Ahmed family has recently immigrated to the States and chooses to live in Middle America. The family is confronted by the Monroes, an American family who has a great distrust of foreigners, particularly Arabs. Walker Monroe (Bruce Gooch) wants to drive the Syrian family out of their town. Meanwhile Salaam (Garen Boyajian), the young son of the immigrants has fallen in love with the American family's daughter Bridget (Shenae Grimes). Walker recruits a fatherless teen next door to help him drive the Ahmeds out of his town but in doing so he jeopardizes Salaam's life and his own daughter's happiness.
