A worksheet is a sheet of paper, or on a computer, on which problems are worked out or solved and answers recorded. Students in a school may have 'fill-in-the-blank' sheets of questions, diagrams, or maps to help them with their exercises. Students will often use worksheets to review what has been taught in class. A worksheet generator is a software program that generates problems, particularly in mathematics or numeracy. Such software is often used by teachers to make classroom materials and tests. In accounting a worksheet often refers to a loose leaf piece of stationery from a columnar pad, as opposed to one that has been bound into a physical ledger book. From this, the term was extended to designate a single, two-dimensional array of data within a computerized spreadsheet program. Common types of worksheets used in business include financial statements, such as profit and loss reports. Analysts, investors, and accountants track a company's financial statements, balance sheets, and other data on worksheets. In the Microsoft spreadsheet program Excel, a single document is known as a 'workbook' and by default each workbook contains three arrays or 'worksheets'. One advantage of such programs is that they can contain formulae so that if one cell value is changed, the entire document is automatically updated, based on those formulae.
