Depil is a village in the Faroe Islands. Depil is located on the east side of Boroy between Nordepil and Nortoftir. The village has only two inhabitants. The Farmsetead in Depil In the early 19th century the village of Depil was practically derelict. The farmers had left the place, the ownership of the land was in the hands of outsiders, and half the cultivated soil had turned into wilderness again. At the census in 1801, there were only three old people left, and the village was probably abandoned for some years up to 1815. But in the fall of 1815, a man called li rantsson, born 1766, and his wife Anna ladttir moved from Nortoftir to Depil, and life returned to the ancient village. The story tells, that it was Guttorm Guttormsson who in 1815 built the oldest part of the farmstead in Depil. The lowest part of the house is younger, and the upper part was built by Tummas  Depli in 1823, who used driftwood as building material.
