The 1954 World Sportscar Championship season was the second season of FIA World Sportscar Championship motor racing. It featured a series of six endurance races for sportscars, contested from January 24 to November 23, 1954.  Note: The Tourist Trophy was awarded to the DB of Paul Armagnac and Gerard Laureau, which was the winner of the Dundrod race on handicap.[1] World Championship points were awarded on the overall race results rather than the handicap results.[1] Championship points were awarded for the top 6 finishing positions in each race in the order of 864321.[1] Only the highest placed car of each manufacturer was eligible to score points,[1] no points being awarded for positions filled by additional cars from the same manufacturer. Only the best 4 results for each manufacturer counted towards the championship results.[1] Discarded points are shown within brackets in the table below. The following models contributed to the nett championship pointscores of their respective manufacturers.[3]
