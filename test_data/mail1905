Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson won re-election to a second term.[1] Thurmond was the underdog in trying to become the first African-American to serve Georgia in the U.S. Senate. Thurmond claimed "Polls are irrelevant. As everyone knows, the only poll that counts is the election on November 2."[5] Isakson has defended his record saying "Big business is not evil. If you didn't have big business, you wouldn't have jobs in America today."[6] Despite the fact all political prognasticars classified the race as being safe for Isakson by August 20,[7] he stated that Thurmond was a potentially formidable candidate, and that he would take nothing for granted.[8]
