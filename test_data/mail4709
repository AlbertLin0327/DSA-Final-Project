Pedro Alvarado Torres of Parral, Chihuahua was a worker and philanthropist who operated the Palmilla mine near Parral in Chihuahua Mexico that was one of the country's richest silver mines. He was married to Virginia Griensen Zambrano. The family became friends and supporters of Doroteo Arango (A.K.A. Francisco Villa) and looked after Villa's family after his assassination.
