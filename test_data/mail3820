The 2007 Fort Dix attack plot involved a group of six radical Islamist men who conspired to stage an attack against U.S. Military personnel stationed at Fort Dix, New Jersey.[1] The alleged aim of the group was to "kill as many soldiers as possible".[2] The men were arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on May 8, 2007, and were prosecuted in federal court in October 2008.[3] On December 22, 2008, five were found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder in their intentions to kill U.S. military personnel; four received life sentences, while one received 33 years in prison. The remaining member was thought to have had a minor role in the plot and was sentenced to five years in prison for weapons offenses.[4] The FBI's use of two paid convicts, one of whom was fighting deportation, as informants in the case has led some to accuse the FBI of entrapment and the Dukas are appealing.[5][6] The six men traveled to the Poconos, where they allegedly practiced firing "semi-automatic weapons"[13] at a shooting range in Gouldsboro, Pennsylvania[10] The shooting range, at Pennsylvania State Game Land 127,[14] is operated by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.[15] A group of ten men[16] had recorded video footage of themselves shooting weapons and shouting Allahu Akbar ("God is greater").[17] On January 31, 2006, the men took the video to the Circuit City in Mount Laurel, New Jersey to convert it to a DVD. An employee of the store, Brian Morgenstern, alerted authorities, and a full-scale investigation was initiated.[10][18] An informant from the FBI infiltrated the group to gather information.[19] The group's planning was caught on video and audio tape by federal authorities. They also trained in Cherry Hill, New Jersey.[13] US Attorney Chris Christie stated that one of the suspects was able to draw a detailed map of Fort Dix from memory.[20] The men continued to hold normal jobs. The Duka brothers, Eljvir, Dritan, and Shain (Albanians), operated a roofing business known as Qadr. Inc., Colonial Roofing and National Roofing. Agron Abdullahu (Albanian), Serdar Tatar (a Turkish legal immigrant), and Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer (a U.S. citizen from Jordan) held a variety of jobs, including that of a taxi driver and clerk for 7-Eleven.[10] Five of the men arrested, according to news reports, intended to attack the Fort Dix military base and kill as many servicemen as they could.[2] The sixth man arrested, Abdullahu, has been charged with aiding and abetting in the possession of firearms by the Duka brothers.[12] The group revealed to the FBI informant (a conversation that was recorded) that the five other men intended to "hit a heavy concentration of soldiers [...] You hit four, five or six Humvees and light the whole place [up] and retreat completely without any losses".[10] The men attempted to purchase weapons from an FBI informant, including AK-47s, M16s, M60s, rocket propelled grenades, rockets, semi-automatic Sig Sauer 9 mm handguns, Smith & Wesson 9mm, C-4 plastic explosive, and nitroglycerin. The informant told them that the weapons would come from an underground military dealer from Baltimore, Maryland who had recently returned from Egypt.[13] One of the men in the Fort Dix plot was recorded on a now widely broadcast surveillance tape commenting on a lecture by Anwar al-Awlaki, a controversial American Muslim cleric who was targeted for killing by President Obama in 2010[citation needed]. On that tape, Shain Duka exclaimed You gotta hear this lecture ... it's the truth, no holds barred, straight how it is! [21] The six suspects were indicted on June 5, 2007[22] and were arraigned in federal court in Camden on June 14 where they pled not guilty.[23] The U.S. District Judge Robert B. Kugler called it "an unusual case" and called for the trial to begin by early October, adding, "If the government is not able to prove this case, they should not be in jail. I want to get this resolved."[24] Agron Abdullahu, suspected of having the smallest role in the attack plot, accepted a plea bargain with a limit of 5 years in prison for his weapons offenses. Prosecutors say that while Abdullahu supplied weapons to the other five men, he resisted the idea of attacking the military base.[25] Opening arguments were presented on October 20, 2008. Assistant U.S. Attorney William Fitzpatrick asserted that the defendants were inspired by jihad, saying "Their motive was to defend Islam. Their inspiration was Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. Their intention was to attack the U.S."[26] Prosecutors presented recordings of the plot obtained by two paid FBI informants during a 16-month undercover investigation as well as suspicious videos that were found on one defendant's computer. Defense attorneys countered that the videos, alleged by the prosecution to be terrorist training videos, merely showed the defendants on holiday exhibiting "false bravado". They also attacked the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses.[3][4] On December 22, 2008, the plotters were found guilty on charges of conspiracy to harm US military personnel. However, they were acquitted on the charge of attempted murder.[4] During sentencing, Dritan and Shain Duka received life sentences for the conspiracy conviction with an additional 30 years for related weapons charges.[27] Eljvir Duka and Mohamad Shnewer both received life sentences and Serdar Tatar was sentenced to 33 years in prison.[28] A 2011 NPR report claimed some of the people associated with this group were imprisoned in a highly restrictive Communication Management Unit. [29] Dritan Duka is currently serving his life sentence at the United States Penitentiary, Florence ADX, a supermax facility where the most dangerous inmates in the federal prison system are held. It is part of the Florence Federal Correctional Complex in Colorado.[30] Shain Duka is currently serving his life sentence at the United States Penitentiary, Florence, a high security facility which is also part of the Florence Federal Correctional Complex in Colorado.[31] Eljvir Duka is currently serving his life sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Terre Haute, a medium security facility which is part of the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute in Indiana.[32] Mohamad Shnewer is currently serving his life sentence at the United States Penitentiary, Marion, a high security facility in Illinois.[33] Serdar Tatar is currently serving his 33-year sentence at the United States Penitentiary, Tucson, a high security prison in Arizona; he is scheduled for release in 2036.[34] Agron Abdullahu was released from federal prison on March 24, 2009.[35] On the hard drive of a retrieved laptop, the downloaded last will and testament of two September 11 hijackers[19] and militant Islamist recruiting speeches given by Osama bin Laden and others were allegedly recovered.[13]
