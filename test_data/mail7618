Eden of the East (, Higashi no Eden?) is a Japanese anime television series, which premiered on Fuji TV's noitaminA timeslot on April 9, 2009. Created, directed and written by Kenji Kamiyama, it features character designs by Chika Umino and animation production by Production I.G. Based on an original story by Kamiyama, it is the first original noitaminA series.[1][2] A compilation of the TV series, Eden of The East Compilation: Air Communication, had a limited theatrical release on September 26, 2009.[3] Two other theatrical films have also been released. Eden of the East Movie I: The King of Eden was released in Japan on November 28, 2009 and the second movie, Eden of the East the Movie II: Paradise Lost, was released on March 13, 2010.[4][5][6] The TV series and both films have been licensed for release in North America by Funimation Entertainment.[7][8] On December 27, 2010, the series made its North American debut on the FUNimation Channel.[9] On Monday, November 22, 2010, ten missiles strike against uninhabited areas of Japan, claiming no victims. This apparent terrorist act is referred to as "Careless Monday" and disregarded by most people. The series begins three months later, on Sunday, February 13, 2011, when a young Japanese woman named Saki Morimi visits Washington D.C. as part of her graduation trip. When she gets into trouble, a mysterious Japanese man, who introduces himself as Akira Takizawa, helps her through it. The man appears to have no memory and is completely naked, carrying only a gun and a cell phone charged with 8.2 billion in digital money. While they are coming back to Japan, they learn that a new missile has hit their country. Akira discovers that his phone is part of a game created by a "Mr. Outside", and that he himself is one of the participants. The game consists of twelve individuals, dubbed Seleo (Portuguese: "Selection"), who are given 10 billion to "save" Japan in some way. The Seleo are able to use the phone operator, Juiz (Portuguese: "Judge"), to fulfill any kind of order for a price. However, if the money is used up completely or for selfish purposes, the individual will be eliminated by the Supporter, the anonymous "twelfth man" of the group, actually revealed to be Seleo No. 12. The title of the series comes from the name of a cell phone application developed by several of Saki's friends, which provides an advanced online image recognition and social networking service. The Eden of the East software can almost immediately recognize and provide details about nearly any object, allowing users to submit images and comments to use as data for future recognition. As the series progresses, Akira discovers that Juiz is a computer system. He also learns one of the Seleo was the one who ordered missiles to be fired in Japan and the reason he erased his own memories was linked to Careless Monday. The same Seleo member decides to launch missiles towards Japan again, but is stopped by Akira, who orders missiles to intercept the incoming missiles, utilizing Eden to provide interception data. Akira decides that the only way to save Japan is to lead it, and uses his money to crown himself "King of Japan" and erase his own memory. The first film starts with Saki arriving in New York to look for Akira. She muses over the past six months, revealing that Akira disappeared after brainwashing himself again, leaving her only his Seleo phone and a message to meet him where their journey began. As she searches for Akira, the viewer learns that several Seleo are monitoring him as well. Number 6 is revealed to be a film enthusiast who is trying to orchestrate Akira's death and catch it on camera. Saki's friends from the Eden of the East project have found their software turned into a successful small business due to global recognition of the software's role in stopping the missile attacks. Images of Akira pointing at the missiles and instructing for them to be shot down have widely circulated across the globe, making him a folk hero dubbed the "Air King". Saki visits Brooklyn overlooking the East River, where the Twin Towers used to be. She tries to re-create the scene from a picture Akira took on his cellphone in Japan when they were on a ferry and the background reminded them of the 9/11 site and encounters him there. She explains his past and role as a Seleo, and his quest to become King of Japan. After Number 6 repeatedly attempts to assassinate Akira and Saki, the pair are rescued by Number 11. Shortly after, Number 1 discovers the location of a truck convoy carrying individual Juiz units for each Seleo member, and orders several of them to be destroyed via missile. Number 11 sacrifices her truck to save Akira's, cutting her link to the game. The film ends with Saki and Akira on a flight back to Japan. Akira and Saki return to Japan, immediately meeting Chigusa Iijima, the wife of the last Prime Minister. In the previous film, Takizawa was accused of being the illegitimate son of Prime Minister Iijima, Chigusa snatching some of Takizawa's hair to get a DNA test. Akira is separated from Saki but asks her to track down his mother, using his pet dog Annie to identify her through Eden of the East's website. Takizawa manages to escape his escort by trading places with one of the 20,000 NEETs he involved in his fight against the "Careless Monday" attacks. Takizawa makes contact with the Eden staff, planning to rescue his version of Juiz before Seleo No. 1, Daiju Mononobe, targets and destroys it. Saki and Satoshi Osugi track down Annie's owner, a woman named Aya who denies being Akira's mother but admits she did live in New York for a time and had a fling with Iijima. Mononobe learns of Aya, sending police officers to interrogate her. Aya flees, followed by Saki who confronts her again. Aya departs with no confirmed answer, however, Saki becomes convinced that she is indeed Akira's mother after she reveals her knowledge that Takizawa was abandoned with five-hundred yen. Akira locates his Juiz unit, but witnesses Mononobe's version being driven to safety to avoid more missiles. Akira drives his own Juiz, disguised as a truck, after Mononobe's which he then steals with help from the Eden staff. Hirasawa, leader of Eden, goes off on his own after Seleo No. 3 gives away the location of Saizo Ato, the true identity of "Mr. Outside". Hirasawa meets Mr. Outside, now an elderly taxi driver, also doubling as Seleo No. 12 and the Supporter. Mr. Outside admits he selected the Seleo after each of them took a ride in his taxi, aside from Akira who he met while the latter was on a paper round and expressed his views on the use of money in Japan. Akira and the Eden staff drive to Chigusa's house, where Akira speaks to Mononobe, who requests Akira retire from the game so he can take control of the government. Akira eventually declines, and plans his final action in the game. Connecting Juiz to Yutaka Itazu's program, "Airship", Akira contacts every phone in Japan and gives all of their owners one yen to help change the future of Japan. Impressed, Mr. Outside decides to end the game. Contacting the remaining Seleo, whether or not they had been eliminated, Mr. Outside declares all of them winners and as a farewell gift, erases all of their memories of the game, aside from Akira who had become immune to the effects. Ryo Yuki, Seleo No. 10, who had previously destroyed his phone and not heard Mr. Outside's message, confronts Mononobe and kills him, only to die when he is hit by Mononobe's car. Akira checks the DNA results Chigusa had, learning he is not Iijima's son after all. He departs, but promises Saki to reunite with her some day. In the epilogue, Saki narrates how Eden closed down for a time to support the NEETs, and how Takizawa had not yet returned. In a final scene, Takizawa meets up again with Mr. Outside.[10]  Eden of the East started out as a small recycling group, but has quickly turned into a springboard for a successful commercial website, thanks to Micchon's revolutionary image recognition engine that resides in the Eden website and Saki's ability to improve the value of any item, including junk. Soon, the site's ability to work on phones attracted many people as members, inclusive of students. It has also grown into a popular matchmaking site. The notable members of the Eden of the East project are: Seleo No. 7 and No. 8 have minor roles, No. 7 never being identified and No. 8 is revealed to be a middle-aged man in a suit who appears in a cameo at the end of the second film listening to Mr. Outside's closing statement of the game. The series was announced in 2008's 23rd issue of Hakusensha's Young Animal manga magazine, denoting Kamiyama's involvement as creator, director and writer and Umino's involvement as character designer.[1][2] It was further announced that two theatrical films are also planned for the series, which is stated to premiere on November 28, 2009 and March 2010 respectively, after the television series ends its original run.[4] In March 2009, it was also announced that the series would premiere on noitaminA on April 9, 2009.[11] On March 19, 2009, the official website to the series relaunched with a trailer, which announced that the opening theme would be "Falling Down" by English rock band Oasis, while the ending theme was "futuristic imagination" by Japanese band School Food Punishment.[12] On April 9, 2009, the series began its run of 11 episodes, by two films, run in theaters alongside Eden of the East Compilation: Air Communication - a film retelling of the 11 episode TV series.[13] The studio originally planned for a second season but decided instead that a pair of movies would be better.[14] The Japanese release of the first DVD volume debuted on July 29, 2009, in 23rd place on the Oricon video charts with 4,394 copies sold[when?].[15] The first volume of the Blu-ray Disc release was also released on that day, and debuted in 7th place on the SoundScan Japan Blu-ray Disc charts.[16] The series has won numerous awards since its release, including the TV Feature Award at the 2009 Animation Kobe festival and the best television series of the year award at the ninth annual Tokyo International Anime Fair.[17][18][19] The series received high marks for its first episode in the Anime News Network Spring 2009 Preview Guide. Reviewers Theron Martin, Carlo Santos, and Casey Brienza each gave the first episode a rating of 4.5 out of 5,[20][21][22] while Carl Kimlinger rated it a 5 out of 5.[23] In his review, Martin wrote that "this is not your normal anime series. If you're looking for the new season's most unusual entry, something well departed from all of the game adaptations, shonen action series, and cutesy romances, this one is it." Additionally, he praised the artistic aspects of "outstanding background art, appealing character designs, highly likeable lead characters, and a unique closer." He concluded that "this one does everything it can to draw viewers in with its first episode and get them to want to keep watching, and many will."[20] Santos commented that "there's only one reason this episode falls short of perfect: it's not until the end that the story really takes off", but also pointed out the "slick, expressive animation."[21] Brienza started her review saying "Well, what the heck; might as well be blunt right from the get-go: I loved it," but criticized the "hackneyed plot" and claimed it "has been ripped whole cloth from a Robert Ludlum novel." Her praise related to "the scrupulous, realistic detail of the Washington D.C. setting" and the "gentle, whimsical innocence" of "Chica Umino's character designs", as well as "the scatological humor... and tender hopes of the heroine" which reminds me a lot of Hayao Miyazaki."[22] Kimlinger, while admitting "I am not a fan of Kenji Kamiyama", stated the episode was "a weird and charming start to a weird and charming show." He wrote that "the first few minutes of Eden are some of the funniest in recent memory", and commented that "both leads have a conspicuous excess of likeability, and Kamiyama displays a mastery of smiling humanism that would have been unthinkable earlier in his career." Like Brienza, he pointed out that "the debt Eden owes to The Bourne Identity is considerable", but concludes that "the result is, in a word, superb."[23]
