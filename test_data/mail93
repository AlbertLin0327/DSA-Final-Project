During the Seven Years' War he implemented a financial innovation the so called "wisselruiterij". After the outbreak of peace in 1763 he could no longer meet his obligations and he went bankrupt. This also brought other banks into trouble, resulting in a confidencecrisis. The banks didn't want to give each other credit anymore. Spreading from Amsterdam an international banking crisis ensued, which extended to Germany and Scandinavia.
