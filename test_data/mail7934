Fred Smith (born 10 April 1948, New York) is an American bass guitarist, best known for his work with Television. He was the original bassist with Blondie until he replaced Richard Hell when Hell left Television in 1975 to form The Heartbreakers. At the time, Television played at CBGB along with Blondie. According to Smith, "Blondie was like a sinking ship and Television was my favorite band." When Television broke up in 1978, he returned to Blondie, despite the negative reaction that his participation in other projects had caused.[1] Smith also participated in the solo albums of the Television guitarists Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd, and played with such artists as The Roches, Willie Nile, and Peregrins.[2] From 1988 to 1989 he played bass, recorded, and toured with The Fleshtones.
