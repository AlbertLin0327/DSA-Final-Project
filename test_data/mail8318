The National Youth Competition (sponsored as the Toyota Cup) is the official development competition for the Australian National Rugby League. It commenced in 2008.[1] The competition consists of teams from the 16 clubs that presently participate in the NRL competition, fielding squads made up of players between the ages of 17 and 19.[2] The draw and structure mirrors the NRL, with games played as lead-ins to the corresponding first-grade NRL games.[3] The competition uses a salary cap in the same way as first-grade NRL, and puts a heavy focus on life outside of football for the players.[4] The New Zealand Warriors are the most successful club in the National Youth Competition's short history, with two premierships already to their name, both coming in 2010 and 2011. The Toyota Cup Player of the Year award is the premier individual award in the Toyota Cup. The voting for the award is similar to the Dally M Medal voting, where after each Toyota Cup game 3 points are awarded to the best player on ground, 2 points to the second and 1 point to the third. So far, every winner of the award has gone onto play first grade in the NRL. The inaugural winner was Ben Hunt from the Brisbane Broncos in 2008. The Jack Gibson Medal is awarded to the man of the match of the Toyota Cup grand final. The award is named after legendary rugby league coach, Jack Gibson. Gibson, who guided Eastern Suburbs to premierships in 1974 and 1975, the Parramatta Eels to three successive premierships from 1981 to 1983 and was named coach of the Team of the Century, passed away in 2008.
