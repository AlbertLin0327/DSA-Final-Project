A torture museum is a museum that exhibits instruments of torture and provides tutorials on the history of torture and its use in human society. There are several museums dedicated to the history of torture located in Europe such as the Torture Museum in Amsterdam, Netherlands, Mediaeval Torture Museum (Mittelalterliches Foltermuseum) in Rdesheim am Rhein and the Medieval Criminal and Torture Museum (Museo della Tortura e di Criminologia Medievale) in San Gimignano, Italy, Museum of Medieval Torture Instruments, in Prague 1, Krizovnick nm 194/1 (near Charles Bridge)
