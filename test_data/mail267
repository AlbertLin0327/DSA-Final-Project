Liu Jue (Liu Cheh, traditional: , simplified: ); ca. 1409-1472 was a Chinese landscape painter, calligrapher, and poet during the Ming Dynasty (13681644). Liu was born in Changzhou in the Jiangsu province.[1] His style name was 'Tingmei' and his sobriquet was 'Wan'an'. Liu's painting used a plump brush stroke style, which would later influence Shen Zhou.
