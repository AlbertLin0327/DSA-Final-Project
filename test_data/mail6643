"Walkabout" is a song by Atlas Sound featuring Noah Lennox. It appears as the third track on his second studio effort Logos. Although never released as a single, it is often seen as the lead single as it was the first song officially released from the album. Upon initial release, Pitchfork Media included it in their best new tracks section[1] and rated it as 34th best song of the year.[2] The track utilizes an extensive sample of "What Am I Going to Do" by The Dovers. The song came about when Atlas Sound began to tour as the opener for Animal Collective in Europe. Bradford states:[3] Although the song is mainly constructed from samples, when performing live Cox will rarely use a sampler to recreate it, as he hasn't since mid 2009. When he toured in late 2009, the song was played with opening band for that tour The Selmanaires.[4] Since early 2010, Cox will simply play the song with an acoustic guitar featuring large improvised sections and occasionally a drum machine.[5]
