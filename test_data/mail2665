Patricia (Pat) Kernighan, a politician and a lawyer, is a District 2 city council member in Oakland, California, noted for her advocacy of instant run-off voting in city elections. Kerninghan, a native of rural Eastern Washington state, received a bachelor of arts degree in social sciences in 1973 from the University of Washington and a law degree in 1977 from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law.[1][2][3] In Seattle, Washington, while a college student in the 1970s, Kernighan was a member of the Feminist Coordinating Council, an organization that proposed a city ordinance to establish a commission on crimes against women and a protection unit.[4] She was admitted to the California State Bar in December 1977.[citation needed] She was a legislative aide to Councilmember John Russo and later was chief of staff to Councilmember Danny Wan from 2000 until his resignation in 2005.[5] She was elected to the Oakland City Council in 2005 and reelected in a 2006 election against challenger Aimee Allison.[6] In 2010, she defeated Jen Pae to win a third term.[7][8] In 2006, Kernighan co-authored a measure to implement instant-runoff voting in Oakland,[9][10] and voters approved the measure in November 2006,[11][12]. Oakland began using the voting system in its November 2010 elections for mayor, three city council races and four other local offices.[13] Kernighan co-authored a measure to fund major park renovations around Oakland's Lake Merritt. The measure passed in 2002.[14][15] She is married to Paul Gordon and has two grown daughters.[citation needed] Access to some of the links may require registration.
