 Amsterdam is the capital city of the Netherlands. It has the largest urban area, of any city in the Netherlands, followed by Rotterdam and The Hague. It covers an area of 219.4 square km. It is located in the province of North Holland. Amsterdam is situated on the bank of the IJ bay, and the Amstel River. The land on which Amsterdam is built is flat, and low-lying. Parts of the city are below sea level, on manmade pieces of land, making the ground soft and marshy. It is on the south bank of the IJ, a bay connected to the IJsselmeer, which is connected to the North Sea by canal. Amsterdam is home to more than one hundred kilometers of canals. The three main canals are Prinsengracht, Herengracht and Keizersgracht, all 3 of which are navigable by boat. In the Middle Ages, Amsterdam was surrounded by a moat, called the Singel, which now forms the innermost ring in the city, and makes the city center a horseshoe shape. The city is also served by a seaport. It is often nicknamed the "Venice of the North," due to its division into approximately 90 islands, which are linked by more than 1,200 bridges.[1]
