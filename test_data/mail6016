Deepdene was an estate and country house, located in Dorking, Surrey, England. The house was remodeled by the architect, William Atkinson, for the banker, Thomas Hope, and the work completed in 1819; it was occupied by his son, the MP Henry Hope from c. 1840.[1] The gardens were laid out in a contemporary Italianate picturesque style. The horticulturalist and planner John Claudius Loudon praised the gardens as an exemplar of landscape architecture, one of the earliest uses of that phrase. The house was demolished in 1969.[1] Coordinates: 511349N 001919W / 51.23028N 0.32194W / 51.23028; -0.32194
