The bombing of Belgrade streets was a missile attack occurring on May 1, 1999 during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. NATO states it targeted the headquarters of the army, special police and the Ministry of Defense builidng in Belgrade. Additionally, NATO admitted one missile hit a residential area but said they were not aware of the claims of civilian casualties in Yugoslav media.[1] Homes on Vardarska Street were completely destroyed. According to eyewitnesses, a bomb landed in a space between two homes and two family members were injured and taken to an Emergency Medical Center. They recovered from their injuries and survived. The bomb made a two-meter-deep crater between the houses and destroyed the asphalt entry way, with the only thing remaining being a pillar with a street name sign on it. Due to the powerful detonation, a white Yugo passenger car was thrown onto the ruins of the house - a pile of rafters, roof tiles and bricks. The missile exploded near the street water pipe, causing a temporary flood in a part of the Vardarska street.[2][3]
