The Brattleboro Reformer is the third-largest daily newspaper in the U.S. state of Vermont. With a weekday circulation of just over 10,000[1], it is behind the Burlington Free Press and the Rutland Herald, respectively. It publishes six days a week, Monday through Saturday, with its Weekend Reformer having the largest readership; the offices of the paper are in Brattleboro, Vermont and it has a market penetration (weekday sales per 100 households) of 62.8 in its home zip code. The Reformer covers all of Windham County, Vermont, as well as some towns in neighboring Cheshire County, New Hampshire. It has been owned by the Denver-based MediaNews Group since 1995, and is run by New England Newspapers, a MediaNews Group subsidiary. It is the only newspaper in the United States called "Reformer."[2] The Reformer published its first issue, under the name Windham County Reformer, in 1876. Publisher Charles N. Davenport, a prominent lawyer and supporter of the Democratic Party, founded the paper in part due to dissatisfaction with what he saw as a Republican bias in the coverage by the Vermont Phoenix, the main political paper in the state. The presidential campaign at the time, between Republican Rutherford B. Hayes and Democrat Samuel J. Tilden prompted the Vermont Record and Farmer, the third paper in the state, to describe the new paper as dedicated to "Tilden and reform." While local historians believe that the original conception of the paper was for it to last only for the duration of the 1876 campaign, Davenport's son, Charles H., ran the paper for twenty-five years after which it was passed on to editors unconnected with the Davenport family. The paper went from a weekly to twice-weekly publication schedule in 1897. While the paper had financial troubles for many years, it managed to maintain a continuous publication schedule. In 1903, it was bought by the Vermont Printing Company, and its new editors turned the paper away from its partisan Democrat emphasis. The Phoenix and Reformer were merged in 1913 under the management of the Brattleboro Publishing Company, with the Phoenix serving as the Reformer's weekly companion and the Reformer going to a daily publication schedule. The Phoenix weekly was discontinued in 1955. The 1913 merger was considered by some to be the "true" founding date of the paper; according to an article in the March 4, 1925 issue, "Daily Reformer Now 15 Years Old": Records at the Brooks Memorial Library, the main library of Brattleboro, list the publication history of the paper in 2006 as Much of the historical information in this section comes from a special 1981 section of the Reformer, published on the occasion of the paper's moving from downtown Brattleboro to its headquarters on Black Mountain Road. The Reformer was possibly the first newspaper in the United States to run same-sex union announcements in parallel to the usual wedding notices[3], beginning the practice in 1989, well before the state of Vermont legalized civil unions. In the past the paper has been controversial for running letters to the editor that many have found offensive[4]; in 2003 it ran an anti-semitic letter whose publication the thenmanaging editor Kathryn Casa defended, saying that "only by bringing [bigoted opinions] into the open can we expose and eliminate them." Casa was replaced by Kevin Moran, who was recruited from the North Adams Transcript in Massachusetts, which is also owned by MediaNews Group. Moran moved to work as managing editor at the Berkshire Eagle.[5] In November 2005, the Reformer hired Sabina Haskell as the new editor. She had previously been assistant editor at the Rutland Herald and had also run the Bennington Banner. Haskell quit to take a PR job for Republican Vermont governor Jim Douglas in 2007. Then managing news editor Tom D'Errico was promoted to fill the editor position. The publisher of the Reformer, Martin Langeveld, resigned after two years on the job in April 2008.[citation needed] Ed Woods, publisher of the Bennington Banner, replaced him in the same month. The paper was involved in a number of controversies in the years 2003-2004. Union leaders and members of the public protested in 2003, when the management fired a reporter during a campaign to form a union at the Reformer. More than 1,000 people signed a petition that called on Media News to re-hire the union supporter.[6][7][8][9] Readers complained when the parent company fired managing editor Kathryn Casa without giving a reason in 2004[10]. Critics asserted that the firing was in part connected to her liberal politics[11]; on the other hand, Casa was accused of intimidating staff into voting against a union drive. Judith Gorman, a columnist for the paper, resigned in protest following Casa's dismissal; about 150 people protested Casa's dismissal outside the Reformer offices on April 25 of that year.
