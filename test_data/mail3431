This is a round-up of the 1987 Sligo Senior Football Championship. St. Mary's won their eighth title in eleven attempts, after defeating holders Tubbercurry in the fifth successive final between the sides. This year's Championship saw the return of the group stages used from 1974 to 1977, but its return was short-lived. The Championship was contested by 14 teams, divided into four groups. The top side in each group qualified for the semi-finals. There was a three-way playoff required in Group 3. Geevagh defeated Grange/Maugherow in the first tie, but Eastern Harps won the final playoff to claim the last semi-final spot.
