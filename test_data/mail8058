In geology, mineralization is the hydrothermal deposition of economically important metals in the formation of ore bodies or "lodes". The first scientific studies of this process took place in Cornwall, United Kingdom by J.W.Henwood FRS and later by R.W. Fox, FRS [1]. The term can also refer to the process by which sediments replace organic material within the body of an organism that has died and was buried by sediments.[2] Mineralization may also refer to the product resulting from the process of mineralization. For example, mineralization (the process) may introduce metals (such as gold) into a rock. That rock may then be referred to as possessing gold mineralization.
