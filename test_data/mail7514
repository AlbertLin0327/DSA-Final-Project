see text Salsola stocksii is a shrub species of the family Amaranthaceae. Salsola stocksii is a sturdy, glabrous or pruinose shrub 25-80 cm tall, its branches are prostrate or ascending. The distinct, sessile, spreading leaves are terete, fleshy, to 5 mm long and 1,5 mm in diameter. The opposite branches spread nearly horizontally. The inflorescences are wide paniculate with 3-12 cm long spike-like branches with numerous flowers. Perianth segments are only 1,5 mm long. The 5 stamens are alternating with ovate staminodes. Fruiting, the perianth segments develop spreading brown wings, circa 6 mm in diameter. The seed diameter is 2,5-3 mm. Salsola stocksii is pollinated by small wild bees (Hymenoptera), that were observed to collect pollen (see foto)[1]. The winged fruits are dispersed by the wind (anemochory). Salsola stocksii is distributed in Afghanistan, Pakistan and West India (Punjab, Rajasthan), where it grows on sandy or loamy saline soils (halophyte) and limestone hills[2]. Salsola stocksii is used as a source of crude sodium carbonate[2] (barilla or "Sajji-Khar"). The "Sajji-Khar" is added as an ingredient for unique taste of famous Bikaneri papad. The ash of this plant is used as substitute of soap for cleaning clothes and is also taken with water for treatment of internal ulcers. Salsola stocksii belongs to the subfamily Salsoloideae of the family Amaranthaceae. The species name was first published by Pierre Edmond Boissier in Diagnoses plantarum orientalium novarum in 1859. Synonyms are Haloxylon stocksii (Boiss.) Benth. & Hook., and Haloxylon recurvum sensu Bunge[2]. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the species does not belong to genus Haloxylon and has to be classified to genus Salsola[3]. Vernacular name: It is locally known as "Khar", meaning salty.
