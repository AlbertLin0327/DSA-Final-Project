Theta Upsilon was a national women's fraternity operating in the United States from February 1921 until May 1962, when the group was absorbed by the Delta Zeta sorority. Theta Upsilon began as a local club at the University of California. Six female students moved into a house on Walnut Street. The house became known as "The Walnut Shell".[1] In the academic year of 1913- 1914, twelve girls organized an official "house club" under the university. It was called Mekatina, which meant "Among the Hills". Mekatina had a ritual based on Native American themes. The pin was a rising sun. The formal founding date, according to Delta Zeta's history, is January 1, 1914.[1] On February 7, 1921, the Mekatina students became members of the Alpha chapter of Theta Upsilon. Ida Shaw Martin, of the Sorority Service Bureau, had outlined the plans for Theta Upsilon and perfected the ritual.[1] Theta Upsilon installed many chapters across the country. Early in its history, the fraternity merged with Lambda Omega and Alpha Sigma Delta sororities. Lambda Omega began as the Norroena club at Berkeley in 1915. The name meant "Breath of the North" and the ritual was based on Native American and Norse values. The Norse values emphasized were hardihood, hospitality, economy, and friendship. Lambda Omega was an associate member of the National Panhellenic Conference. In 1932, Lambda Omega merged with Alpha Sigma Delta, which began as the Iaqua club at Berkeley in 1919. In 1932, Lambda Omega was absorbed by Theta Upsilon.[1] On May 6, 1962, Theta Upsilon fraternity was officially absorbed by Delta Zeta sorority. The ceremony was held at the Alpha Alpha chapter house at Northwestern University. Delta Zeta gained 9 nine new collegiate chapters: There were also three "overlaps" in chapters at Miami, Illinois, and Temple universities.[1] (Per Delta Zeta's history) "As a daughter of light, I believe in loyalty to God, the Light of all our being; in loyalty to our country, the land of opportunity and freedom, where all women have important roles to play; in loyalty to our fellowmen with whom I shall seek constantly understanding and true love. "I believe in love, learning, and labor, bearing in minf that each is incomplete without the other- true love expressed through intelligence, service, learning acquired as a result of loving interest in others, and labor inspired by love and guided by intelligence. I believe in Theta Upsilon, its purposes, its ideals, and its aspirations. I pledge my heart, my head, and my hand to be a good citizen on the campus and in the community, to cooperate in all endeavors, to maintain high ideals in social life, to uphold a worthy standard in harmony with my sisters in Theta Upsilon, that together we may work to further the divine plan for all mankind." - Beatrice Card Fuller[1]
