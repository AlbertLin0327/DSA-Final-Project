6126 Collection is a clothing line that was created by American actress, singer, and entrepreneur Lindsay Lohan in collaboration with Kristi Kaylor. The line was originally a leggings line, before being expanding to a full clothing collection. The name of the collection represents the June 1, 1926 birth date of Marilyn Monroe, whom Lohan has said she admires and has been influenced by.[1] The collection originated in 2008 with leggings.[2] Each type of legging is part of a legging brand within the company. Leggings brands include Fame, Lust, Star and others. Kristi Kaylor, Lohan's partner, said Lohan is involved in the process of designing, choosing the fabrics, trims, and buttons for the leggings collection: "She approves everything, down to invitations for events."[3] 6126 Collection donated all the sales from its Fame leggings to Save the Children to benefit the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake[4] The line expanded from leggings to a full clothing collection in May 2010, with clothing including dresses, leather jackets, blazers, coats, mini [skirts] and pencil skirts, blouses, and corsets.[1] The fashion press reported in April 2010 that the fashion line would include a collection of handbags, shoes, and cosmetics for the Spring 2011 edition.[3][5] Lohan announced[citation needed] she plans to launch a sub-brand called 7286, in reference to her birth date (July 2, 1986). 6126 Collection is sold at such United States retail stores as Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and at D-A-S-H boutique owned by Kim Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian.[6] The collection has also been featured in worldwide stores such as Kitson in Japan, Harrods, and Lane Crawford.[citation needed] The leggings line was released on July 10, 2008 at Fred Segal and for Internet order, on the website Intuition.[2] Lohan has partaken in numerous photo shoots and modeled to help advertise and promote the collection. Her younger sister, Ali Lohan, has also modeled to promote the collection.[citation needed] In April 2009, Lohan participated in a faux eHarmony video for the comedic website Funny or Die.[citation needed] At the end of the video, Lohan says, "You can reach me at 6126-79," which is a combination of 6126, and Sevin Nyne, her artificial tanning lotion. Photographer Scott Nathan said that he was suing Universal Music Group, Lohan's musical label, when he discovered that a photograph he shot of Lohan was used as the cover for her single "Bossy" without his permission. He also claimed he was suing 6126's parent company after being promised one percent interest in the clothing label for photographing Lohan in the leggings.[7]
