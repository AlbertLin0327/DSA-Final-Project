North Melbourne (1929-41) Jim Adamson (born 1 August 1905, date of death unknown) was an Australian rules footballer who played with North Melbourne in the VFL for over a decade. Adamson made his debut for North Melbourne in 1929 and became a regular in the side throughout the 1930s. He was club captain in both the 1937 and 1940 seasons, the latter as caretaker coach. In 1940 he also won North's Syd Barker Medal, and in doing so at the age of 35 became the second oldest best and fairest winner for any club in the league's history. The only player older was 36 year old Cyril Gambetta for St Kilda.[1]
