The 200405 season was Fulham F.C.'s fourth consecutive season in the top flight of English football, the Premier League. They were managed by former player, Chris Coleman, who managed to guide them into a mid-table position of 13th. Despite not being involved in a relegation dogfight at the end of the season, they still had a big say in deciding who went down as they beat Norwich City 6-0 on the last day to relegate them and save West Bromwich Albion. In other competitions, they reached the quarter finals of the League Cup, where they lost to Chelsea, and also reached the fifth round of the FA Cup.
