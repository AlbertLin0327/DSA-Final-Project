Rama Kant Mishra a former IAS officer and renowned scholar died of a massive heart attack in the early hours of 8 September 2011 in New Delhi. He was the fourth son of Mahamahopadhyay, Late Sri Umesh Mishra, the first Vice Chancellor of Kameshwar Singh Sanskrit University, Darbhanga. Affectionately known as Babuji, Sri R. K. Mishra was born in the year 1931 in Prayag, and had just turned 80 on 13 May this year. He is survived by his wife, four daughters & sons-in-law and grand-children. An officer of the UP cadre, Sri R.K.Mishra rose into prominence with his appointment as the first Chief Executive Officer of Sri Kashi Vishwanath Temple in the year 1983 when the temple was taken over by the UP government. The government had decided to take control of the temple after an incident of theft which had rocked the city and the nation. Mishra was finally selected from a short list of officers handpicked by the then Chief Minister himself. R.K Mishras administrative skills backed by his scholarly knowledge of Sanskrit and religious scripts immediately restored the confidence of the people in the sacred institution. A tremendous improvement was witnessed in the functioning of the temple even as the flow of offerings and donations was channelized through strict administrative control and management. No wonder from a meager income of few hundreds the funds of Kashi Vishwanath Temple grew to several crores during his tenure. Sri Mishras simple lifestyle and his total commitment to the temple activities were in fact a talking point for the millions of visitors to the temple. After serving the almighty for over a decade and receiving as many as four extensions, Sri Mishra retired in 1993 but continued to contribute to the temple traditions in various ways for many years to follow. In a career spanning over four decades, Sri R.K.Mishra had earlier served in various capacities in the state government. He continued to play an important role in public life even after his retirement. Sri Mishra was widely known as an authority on Hindu religion and philosophy, obviously carrying the rich legacy of his illustrious father Mahamahopadhyay Umesh Mishra who authored the eminently popular series called History of Indian Philosophy. In his post retirement years Sri R.K.Mishra served on the management boards of various institutions of national repute like Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and Harish Chandra Institute of Atomic Energy. In the year 2010, Sri Mishra was honored with the  Vishisht Samaj Seva Samman from Samrat Harshavardhan Daan Mahotsav Smriti Charitable Trust, Allahabad. An eminent scholar that he was, Sri Mishra was an avid reader and writer and also was fluent in several Indian and foreign languages. Babuji practiced a strict and disciplined lifestyle that inspired many. Stressing the importance of Dharma in human life he also authored a book titled Sandhyopasan Vidhi, dealing with the karmakand of the Hindu society. His upcoming book on the religious and historic importance of Prayag (Allahabad) was almost ready for the press when he died.
