Disney's Katbot was to be a comedy series based on the character Katbot and website created by Angela Martini for Funny Garbage with a pilot directed by Beavis and Butt-head's Emmy-nominated director Mike deSeve. Katbot is described as a curious, somewhat nave, fun-loving cat-robot (secret agent) from the planet Katatonia, who, as part of her schooling is sent to Earth to study preteen culture. By using her hypno-faade, she disguises herself as Katerina Botenski, a foreign exchange student from a small Eastern European country she also calls Katatonia. The only person who knows her secret is her best friend Junior Lebore, the son of her host family. Through her friendships with an eclectic group of earthlings, Katbot experiences life on Earth with a unique and comic perspective. Sherri Stoner (Animaniacs), Bart Jennett (Recess) and John Carlin were to serve as executive producers. Kristin Ellington was to be a co-executive producer and Randy Myers (The Powerpuff Girls, My Life as a Teenage Robot) was to be the director. The series was to star Anneliese van der Pol (of Disney Channel's That's So Raven) as Katbot, Charlie Schlatter (Ferris Bueller television series) as Junior Lebore and Mayim Bialik (Blossom) as Paula. Melissa Greenspan was to be nemesis Marcella Curd. As of June 8, 2005, Disney's Katbot was cancelled. It is unknown as to whether the Martini/deSeve pilot produced by Disney will ever see the light of day. Martini, Angela.
