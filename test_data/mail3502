St Peter's Church is a Church of England parish church in Bournemouth in the English county of Dorset. The building, which is a Grade I listed building, was completed in 1879 to a design by G.E. Street as the founding mother church of Bournemouth. It has unusual paintings, notable stained glass and alabaster, and a renowned musical tradition. The chancel has been described as 'one of the richest Gothic Revival interiors in England'.[1] St. Peter's was built over a period of twenty-four years from 1855 at the instigation of the vicar, the Reverend Alexander Morden Bennett, to replace an earlier building. G.E. Street was commissioned to create a finer church to match the beauty of the town. It was constructed between 1854 and 1879 on the foundations of the 1840s predecessor. (G.E. Street later designed the Royal Courts of Justice in The Strand in London.) The church, which sits opposite Beales department store in the heart of the town centre, was the founding mother church of Bournemouth. The 202ft high spire is a landmark across the town centre and beyond.[2] It has unusual paintings, notable stained glass and alabaster. The church has an organ of three manuals and 48 speaking stops by Harrison and Harrison in 1914, rebuilt by Rushworth and Dreaper in 1976 - the details can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. There is also a Steinway grand piano in the church, and a Kawai grand piano in the song room.[3] The boys' and girls' choirs, together with adult altos, tenors and basses, sing two choral services each Sunday during term time. The St. Peter's Singers, a mixed adult voluntary choir who rehearse once a month, sing at occasional services and festivals. St Peter's has famous connections including William Ewart Gladstone: the Prime Minister took his last communion here. The Shelley Family has a long connection with St. Peter's Bournemouth. Mary Wollstonecraft, a feminist author, and William Godwin, a radical thinker, are buried here alongside their daughter, Mary Shelley, author of Frankenstein. Mary Shelley's husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley died in the Gulf of Spezia in 1822. When his body was recovered, his friend took his heart. It now sits in the Shelley family vault. Mary Shelley's son, Sir Percy Florence Shelley bought land in Boscombe to build a house, believing that the balmy climate would help his sick wife and his mother. However, Mary Shelley never lived in Boscombe Manor. Sir Percy died in 1889 and his wife, Lady Jane Shelley died 10 years later. The family now rests in the family vault at St Peter's Church. The team rector is the Reverend Dr. Ian Terry, who joined the parish in September 2009. Ian and his family had been previously based in Hereford for seven years, where he was Diocesan Director of Education and Honorary Team Vicar in the West Hereford Team.[5] The team vicar is the Reverend Robin Harger, who is also vicar to St Stephen's Church, Bournemouth. The previous rector, the Reverend Canon Jim Richardson, was awarded the OBE in 2006 for services to the Church of England.[6]
