Martinus Dom, born Frans Danil Dom, (Kontich, 24 December 1791-Westmalle, 9 December 1873), was the first abbot of the Trappist Abbey of Westmalle in Belgium and founded the Trappist brewery. He was a son of Jan Frans Dom, a cattle merchant, and Elisabeth Van Berckelaer. He was baptised on Christmas day 1791, the day after his birth, in the Church of Saint Martin in Kontich. As a young man Frans served as a fourrier in the French army of Napoleon. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1814, he returned home to everyday life. He became a notorious partygoer and became engaged. But after some brawls at home with his father and with his life in turmoil, he decided to go on pilgrimage to the Church of Onze-Lieve-Vrouw Van Goede Wil in Duffel to help him decide whether he should marry or enter the Trappist convent of Westmalle. The story goes that he let fate decide by throwing his hat up in the air. If it fell with the opening up he would go to Westmalle, but if it fell with the opening down he would ask for forgiveness and marry. The hat fell with the opening up and he went to the Trappist priory of Westmalle, where at first they didnt take him seriously. But on 11 November 1817, feast day of the patron saint Saint Martin, of Kontich and Westmalle, he entered the convent. In 1817, he took his vows and on 23 December 1820 he was ordained and given the name Martinus. He became one of the teachers of the orphan boys who were educated in the abbey. In 1826 he was elected prior of the priory (the first elected prior), which position he retained until 1836 when he was elected abbot. In 1836, the priory of Westmalle obtained the status of abbey from Pope Gregory XVI. On 14 July 1836, already prior of the convent, Martinus was chosen to be the first abbot of the abbey of Westmalle. When the priory obtained the status of an abbey, the strict rule that the monks could only drink water with their meal was relaxed. Cider or beer was then allowed to be drunk in the refectory of the abbey. Rather than buy beer from outside the abbey, Martinus decided to brew their own beer. They started brewing on 1 August 1836, and on 10 December 1836 the monks tasted their own beer for the first time. Local sales began in 1856, and sales to traders commenced in 1921. Martinus Dom died at Westmalle on 9 December 1873, after he had been prior for 47 years and abbot for 37 years.
