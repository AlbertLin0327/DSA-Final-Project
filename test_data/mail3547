Omar Alejandro Esparza Morales (born May 21, 1988 in Guadalajara, Jalisco) is a Mexican football player who plays as a Right Back and as a Right Wing Midfielder for Chivas de Guadalajara. Esparza made his debut on October 15, 2005 against CF Monterrey, playing only 11 minutes. He had switched playing time between Chivas and CD Tapatio since then, with a brief stay in Chivas Coras in the 2005-2006 season. Esparza took part in Chivas' Championship win in the Apertura 2006. Omar was relegated to a bench role once Sergio Amaury Ponce joined Chivas in early 2009. However, he has played a pivotal role with the team under new manager Jos Luis Real and went on to win player of the year for his club. Esparza was given high praise by Mexico coach Javier Aguirre for his performances and was expected to cement a place in the 2010 World Cup starting line-up. However a knee injury picked up in the final game of the season ended his world cup hopes and he is not expected to be back in full training until June 2010. Omar Esparza has played with the Mexico national football team in three categories. He was present with the Mexico U-17 Team, in which he and his fellow team mates won the U-17 World Cup in Peru in 2005.

The score was 3-0, and Esparza scored the 2nd goal of the final.[1] He has also played with U-20 in the FIFA U-20 World Cup that was held in Canada where he was an important player. Mexico played well but was eliminated by Argentina in the quarter finals, losing 1-0 thanks to a goal scored by Maximiliano Moralez after bouncing the ball off a Mexican defender in the 45th minute .
