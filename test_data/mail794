Charles Wenman (born 1797) was an English cricketer who played for Kent. He was born in Benenden. Wenman made a single first-class appearance, in 1828, against Sussex. Playing as a middle-order batsman, in the same team as his brother, Ned, and his cousin George, he scored three runs in the only innings in which he batted.
