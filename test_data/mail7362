Still, Colognian makes generally only limited use of word order, shifting words around does either not alter the meanings of sentences, or yields other types of sentences having different meanings but keeps the roles of the words as long as their declined forms are kept. Colognian is a predominantly fusional language. It marks its articles, adjectives, nouns, pronouns, and more to distinguish gender, case, and number. Colognian today distinguishes between five cases, they are nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and vocative. There are two kinds of genitive. One is positioned before, the other behind the nomen or nominal phrase it refers to. There are three grammatical genders in Colognian, the feminine, masculine, and neuter gender. Almost all nomina have fixed genders, but there is a class of them that may switch from predominant neuter to feminine on certain occasions. Colognian shares this with a huge group of local and vernacular languages almost along the entire river Rhine. There are grammatical numbers singular, and plural in Colognian. Few individual words implicitly have either singular forms only or plural forms only and cannot be marked the other, but almost all nouns exhibit either forms. Colognian has three grammatical persons, 1stperson, 2ndperson, and 3rdperson. Cologinian grammatical articles come in several flavours:         (**) Singular is always used, when there is exactly one instance of something, or occasionally, depending on the ways, such figures are expressed, with ones having a "one" at their end, such as 1001. Plural is used for anything else but zero. Depending on context and noun, singular or plural is used with zero instances depending on the noun, sometimes either can be chosen, but most often Colognian speakers choose their wording avoiding expressions of the type "zero + noun" using expressions like nix (nothing), undeclensed, or kei (no, none), which is declensed.   In the Colognian, Pronouns come in several variations. There are demonstrative pronouns, stressed definite personal pronouns, unstressed definite personal pronouns, possessive pronouns,  Colognian demonstrative pronouns are used in sentences in positions where a noun phrase lead by stressed or demonstrative article could be used as well. The pronoun 'replaces' it for brevity. In fact, a demonstrative pronoun can formally be seen as a noun phrase with the article retained and anything else spared, because grammar forms of demonstrative pronouns and those of demonstrative articles exhibit no differences. Demonstrative pronouns are either strict anaphora, or can be cataphora being resolved within the same or next sentence or subsentence. The use as exophora is possible and reduces the choice of intonation and stress patterns to exactly one, most commonly supported by appropriate gestures. Example[1] of cataphoric use: Es dat Ding Auto? (Is this your car? , Is that your car?) Example of anaphoric use: D kt noch! (Even though not yet here, he will come!) There are personal pronouns for a variety of uses in Colognian. They all have in common that they link declension with an aspect of conjugation with their forms. Colognian declension follows a case, gender, number scheme, whereas declension among others has a person and number scheme with three grammatical persons: the 1stperson referring to the speaker or speakers as agents or patients of a sentence, the 2ndperson addresses the listener or listeners of the speaker or speakers as agents or patients of a sentence, while the 3rdperson refers to something or someone else but the speaker(s) or the listener(s) as the agents or patients of a sentence, and two grammatical numbers, singular and plural. Declensed forms of personal pronouns combine these schemes. Most possessive pronouns have two distinct uses, some have three.
