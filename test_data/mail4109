na O'Connor (born 1938) is a former Irish sportsperson who played senior camogie with Dublin from 1953 until 1975. She is regarded as one of the greatest players of all-time,[1] a member of the team of the century.[2] the first camogie player to win a Caltex award in 1966,[3] and the Gaelic Weekly all-star award winner in 1967. na O'Connor was born in Fairview, Dublin in 1938. The youngest of eight children her mother died when she was just eighteen years-old. O'Connor grew up in Dublin at a time when the countys Gaelic footballers were successful. She was a great admirer of Kevin Heffernan and often received coaching advice from him before she played in big games. O'Connor played her club camogie with the Celtic club in Dublin. She enjoyed much success with Celtic, winning ten Dublin county camogie championship titles in all. She was also one of the key players when the club won the first All-Ireland club camogie championship in 1964. In 1953 O'Connor won her first All-Ireland medal with Dublin. Although she was only fifteen years-old she showed her exceptional talent by scoring three goals in the defeat of Tipperary. After this the honours came thick and fast for OConnor as she collected two further All-Ireland medals in 1954 and 1955. In 1957 Dublin reached the All-Ireland final once again, however, OConnor was out of favour with the management and was not in the starting line-up for the game. With Dublin struggling with ten minutes left in the game, OConnor was brought on and showed her talent once again by scoring the winning goal. Although she was only nineteen years-old she had just won her fourth All-Ireland medal. This victory began an amazing run of success that by 1966 saw OConnor win ten All-Ireland medals in-a-row. This achievement is unique to OConnor and one that is unlikely to be ever equalled. In 1963 and 1964 she had the honour of captaining her native county to back-to-back victories. In 1967 OConnor appeared in another All-Ireland final, however, Antrim gained revenge on Dublin by beating them in the All-Ireland final replay. In spite of this she received the Caltex Award for best player of the year, thus becoming the first camogie player to be so honoured. In 1975 OConnor came out of retirement to play in the Leinster championship against Wexford. Once again she showed her versatility by playing as a full-back, while she previously played as a forward. In retirement OConnors reputation as one of the greatest players of all-time has grown. Her haul of thirteen All-Ireland medals is a record that stands second to her fellow county colleague Kathleen Mills who heads the honours list with fifteen medals. In 2004 OConnor was named in the wing-forward position on a special team picked to celebrate the centenary of Cumann Camogaochta na nGael. 1Eileen Duffy-O'Mahoney| 2Liz Neary| 3Marie Costine-O'Donovan| 4Mary Sinnott-Dinan| 5Sandie Fitzgibbon| 6Bridie Martin-McGarry| 7Margaret O'Leary-Leacy| 8Mairad McAtanmey-Magill| 9Kathleen Mills-Hill| 10Linda Mellerick| 11Pat Moloney-Lenihan| 12na O'Connor| 13Sophie Brack| 14Deirdre Hughes| 15Angela Downey-Browne|
