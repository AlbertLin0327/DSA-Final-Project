"I'm Yours" is the first single released by Jason Mraz from his third studio album We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things. The song was originally released on a limited edition EP called Extra Credit as a demo in 2005 to promote his second studio album Mr. AZ. It was performed in his 2004 and 2005 gigs and already became a crowd favorite before its release. "I'm Yours" was nominated for Grammy Award for Song of the Year[1] and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 51st Grammy Awards. It was also used for the Australian Seven Network's promotion of the season premiere of Packed to the Rafters. "I'm Yours" was immensely successful in the U.S. on the Billboard charts. At 76 weeks on the Hot 100, it holds the record for most weeks spent on the chart, breaking the previous record of 69 weeks set by LeAnn Rimes' song "How Do I Live" in 1998. It is as of January 2012 the eighth best selling digital song of all time in the U.S.,[2] selling over 6 million downloads.[3] It remains Mraz's biggest hit single in the USA. Mraz sang a version of the song on Sesame Street, instead of "I'm Yours" the song was titled, "Outdoors." Mraz also made a remixed version featuring Lil Wayne and Jah Cure, which also gained success.[4] The single was made available through digital stores on February 12, 2008. Throughout 2008, "I'm Yours" would slowly increase in airplay and digital sales to become Mraz's biggest hit, charting higher than his previous pop hit, 2003's "The Remedy (I Won't Worry)". It has become his first top ten single in the U.S., peaking at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and number five on the Pop 100. On the Billboard Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks chart the song was number one for a total of nine weeks.[5] The single later received Mainstream Top 40 airplay, eventually topping that chart as well. Due to its gradually building crossover appeal, the song has had extremely unusual longevity, not reaching number one on the Mainstream Top 40 until December 2008, ten months after its release and seven months after it debuted on the VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown. In fact, VH1 had already retired the song in early October, 2008 after a 20-week run. The song returned to the top ten of the Hot 100 for the third time in its 38th week on the chart. "I'm Yours" would go on to chart for a total of 76 weeks, making this the longest chart run in Billboard Music magazine history. A year into its release, it topped another chart for the first time, when it hit number one on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks during the week of February 5, 2009. This marked 11 months since the song had topped its first chart in the U.S., when it reached number one on the Triple A chart in March, 2008. I'm Yours spent 16 weeks at number one on the Adult Contemporary chart. In addition, after topping the Adult Contemporary chart, "I'm Yours" became the first song to top the Triple A, Adult Top 40, Mainstream Top 40, and Adult Contemporary charts.[6] Despite weak initial download sales, it has gone onto sell 6 million paid digital downloads by February 2012 in the U.S.,[3] becoming the eighth best selling digital song in the United States.[2] It is Mraz's most successful global single to date, reaching number one in Sweden and Norway, and the top ten in Canada, United States, Austria, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and Italy. It was also able to reach number one on the Top 40 Digital Track Chart in Australia. In Hawaii, radio stations do play the original version, along with a Hawaiian remix of the song. "I'm Yours" has also been a huge hit in New Zealand where it peaked at number one, knocking off "Poker Face" which spent ten consecutive weeks at number one. It was certified Gold after nine weeks selling over 7,500 copies and then certified Platinum after 14 weeks selling over 15,000 copies.[7][8] "I'm Yours" made its debut on the British singles chart on December 12, 2008, at number 78 and then slowly climbed up the chart until it peaked at number 11. It spent the whole of 2009 on the chart apart from the final two weeks of the year, then re-entered in January 2010 and again in August, and has now clocked up 56 weeks on the official UK Top 75, making it currently the 15th longest runner of all time and the longest never to make the Top 10, and 84 weeks on the Top 100.[9] The music video debuted in March 2008. I'm Yours was later featured as the Record of the Week on Scott Mills's BBC Radio One show on November 10, 2008. Since being added to YouTube it has been viewed over 100 million times as of July 2011. It was filmed in Hawaii (Oahu and Kauai) in 2008 with veteran music video director Darren Doane.[10] The videos opening scene is an overhead shot of a private jet at Lihue Airport on Kauai. It sets up the next scene where Mraz is seated, supposedly, in that same airplane.[10] After gazing thoughtfully into a fish tank and putting on a backpack, Mrazs video self departs an apartment, leaving the units key behind. The location was an actual occupied apartment unit on the North Shore of Oahu. All furnishings belonged to the occupants.[10] Mraz sits in the backseat of a taxi. The scene was filmed the morning after completion of Oahu shooting. Doane hunkered down next to the big city of couple of guys in a pick-up truck who take him to the little-known skateboard park on Oahus North Shore.[10] Mraz hops in the back of yet another late model pick-up truck, this time with a trio of girls. The waterfall, on Oahu's windward side, was suggested by the girl he's seen conversing with at the skate parka North Shore resident he and Doane had just met.[10] After a plane ride from Oahu, Mraz catches a shuttle at the Lihue Airport and winds up in the east-side Kauai town, which he simply explores on foot.[10] While it appears in the video as if Mraz hasnt left Kauai, these water shots were filmed in real surf off Mokuauia Island (a.k.a. Goat Island) on Oahus windward coast the day before leaving for Kauai shooting.[10] Mraz sings at an evening backyard jam with longtime percussionist Toca Rivera.[10] Hanalei Pier, Kauai (3:21 and final shot) The final shot of Mraz kicking back on the Hanalei Bay landmark is actually the final shot of the Im Yours shoot.[10]
