The 1990 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season began with the team trying to improve on an embarrassing 5-11 season. Bucs fans were getting tired of head coach Ray Perkins and Bucs players were getting fed up with his 3 a day training camp practices. Leaving many players complaining of fatigue late in the year, and with injuries that never really healed themselves throughout the end of the season. Still, after starting 4-2 including 4 wins against divisional opponents, the Buccaneers dropped two out of three games to a weak Dallas Cowboys team. Later in the year, quarterback Vinny Testaverde and receiver Willie Drewrey combined on an 89 yard touchdown pass in week 13 for the longest play in franchise history. Coach Perkins was fired after that game and the team fell short of a possible break even season with two losses to end the season. Offensive coordinator Richard Williamson was made head coach for the 1991 season based on his 1-2 record, and because of his cheap asking salary demands. Tax records showed the Buccaneers were one of the most profitable teams during this time, even though owner Hugh Culverhouse announced the Bucs were losing money and needed to play games in Orlando, Florida to gain income. It was this discrepancy that revealed Culverhouse ran the Bucs as a profit first business, letting players go who were good, that deserved big contracts. [1] Notes: [2]
