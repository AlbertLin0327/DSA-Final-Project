Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz were an American rap duo consisting of Sean "Lord Tariq" Hamilton and Peter "Peter Gunz" Pankey.[1] They are best known for their song "Deja Vu (Uptown Baby)" which peaked at number nine on the U.S. charts. The duo first appeared on Whodini's 1996 album, Six, appearing on the track "Can't Get Enough", and assisting writing on two other tracks on the album. The duo released their only album in 1998 entitled Make It Reign. The album peaked at #38 on the Billboard 200 and #8 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and featured collaborations with Big Pun, Fat Joe, Sticky Fingaz, Kurupt and Cam'ron. But it was the album's lead single, "Deja Vu (Uptown Baby)" that found the most success. It peaked at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified platinum by the RIAA for sales of over one million. The track peaked at #21 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1998.[1] However, the duo disbanded in 1999 without releasing a follow-up album. Peter Gunz has a son, Peter "Cory Gunz" Pankey, Jr., who is also a rapper currently signed with Young Money Entertainment, and a cousin, Junior who is also a rapper.
