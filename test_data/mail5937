A Kiss That Killed the One We Love is an album recorded by the members of the band He Is Legend in late 2000, while they were in high school, under the name "No One Wins". Many of the CD-R copies of the album that have been spread around by their fans have included the four songs from their 2003 demo, which they recorded while they were going under the name "The Uriah Omen". Some copies have even been known to include various other rare tracks and live recordings. In early 2003 He Is Legend (then known as The Uriah Omen) recorded a four song Demo EP to try to attract label attention. The four songs varied drastically in style and were quite substantial in song length. "Shoot A Fireball At It" is dark, melodic, very heavy at times and also consisted of a 7/8 time signature verse and breakdown. "Robotica" could almost be considered metalcore/progressive metal and consisted of odd time signatures, syncopated breakdowns, and even a tapping solo. "The Red Button" is a fairly catchy song with a very pop influenced chorus, but also has heavy parts. "Maybe the Butler Did It" is more reminiscent of fast paced rock'n'roll with a melodic chorus and lengthy breakdown at the end. The songs often consisted of many different parts that were organized in a very interesting manner. The diversity on the EP paints a picture for how He Is Legend mixes different genres into each album that they have released.
