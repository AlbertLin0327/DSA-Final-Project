Boscombe Surf Reef is an artificial reef built to enhance surfing conditions in Boscombe, Dorset, UK The Boscombe Surf Reef is the first surfing reef to be constructed in the Northern Hemisphere.[1] Boscombe, a district of Bournemouth, opted to build a surfing reef to provide a unique focal point for the town's multi-million pound waterfront redevelopment effort. The idea came originally from David Weight a member of Wessex Surf Club whose proposals to Bournemouth council and initial research date from 1993, The reef is sometimes referred to as "Weights Reef".[2] The reef covers approximately one hectare and is located 225 metres from the Beach. Like most of the other reefs built to date, the Boscombe Reef was built from large sand-filled geotextile containers. With a total volume of 13,000 m3, the reef was designed purely as a surfing break. A study undertaken for Bournemouth council shows that prior to the reef there were 77 good surfing days, although surfing took place on 153 days, with a total of 5,000 surf visits to Boscombe per year. The intention was that the reef would double the number of good surfing days and it was hoped this would generate 10,000 visits. The original estimate for designing and building the reef was 1.4 million. The eventual cost was 3 million for the reef and a total of 11 million for the redevelopment of the seafront area and the refurbishment of the pier. This was funded by the sale of a car park on which Barratt Developments constructed the Honeycombe Chine Flats complex and the sale of Beach Pods which formed part of the Overstrand building. Cabinet/Council approved the land-based proposals but requested a presentation from ASR Ltd on the initial designreport for the surf reef for the Cabinet to consider. The reef which was originally suggested in the late 1990s suffered considerable delays before construction finally began in June 2008[8] by the New Zealand Company ASR Ltd. The geotextile bags were constructed in New Zealand and positioned from a barge. They were then filled with sand which had been stockpiled on the shore from a beach replenishment project(BIS4.2)[9] the previous year. Half of the reef project was completed during the summer of 2008. Construction was suspended for the winter season and resumed the following summer. The reef was officially declared open on the 2 November 2009.[10] In December 2010 Bournemouth Council announced that ASR would return in the spring of 2011 to make modifications to the reef. Four bags were to be situated on the south-east corner of the reef and a further three pillow bags between existing sections of the reef. The intention is that the wave depth will be improved through the gentler slope thus created, resulting in the right-hand ride length extended to 65metres. ASR will receive 55,000 on completion of this work out of the 150,000 withheld final payment.[11] In April 2011 one bag was removed and another repaired after what was suspected to be propeller damage from an unknown boat colliding with the reef.[12]The reef was closed during the summer of 2011 having been closed for safety reasons in March, in July Bournemouth Councillor Rod Cooper, Cabinet Member for Economy & Tourism announced that ASR ltd would undertake the repair work and begin the improvement work in early August[13]. ASR Ltd began the repair work in mid August 2011[14]. In October 2011 Bournemouth council announced that due to the autumn weather the repair and improvement work would not be completed until spring 2012.[15] In the first 18 months after construction there have been some occasions of good surfing conditions [16] but the general reports from surfers were disappointing.[17] In May 2010 the delayed interim report on the reef's performance from Dr. Mark Davidson of Plymouth University was published, it stated that the reef had only fully achieved four out of eleven of its design objectives. ASR claims the reef had met most of the design criteria[18] but did agree with the reports conclusion that the waves produced were shorter than the design criteria required, [19] Despite the negative press surrounding Boscombe Reef, a group of dedicated local bodyboarders continued to use it regularly before and after its closure for safety reasons.[21][22] Coordinates: 504307N 15030W / 50.7185N 1.8417W / 50.7185; -1.8417
