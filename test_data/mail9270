Good (trademarked GOOD in caps) is a media platform that promotes, connects, and reports on the individuals, businesses, and non-profits "moving the world forward."[1] Good produces a website (GOOD.is), a quarterly magazine, and online video content covering a variety of topics, including the environment, education, urban planning, design, food, politics, culture, and health. Good was founded in 2006 by Ben Goldhirsh, son of entrepreneur and Inc. Magazine creator Bernie Goldhirsh. In June 2012 it was reported that Good magazine had laid off nearly all of its editorial staff.[2][3] In 2006, Ben Goldhirsh, then 26, decided to create a magazine dedicated to social causes. Eschewing experienced editors, he hired friends from college and high school, including Al Gore's son, Al Gore III. The team was initially criticized by some industry experts, such as magazine executive and publishing expert Chip Block, who said, "This sounds a lot to me like vanity publishing, a bunch of kids sitting around with something they think is a really good idea, and one of them has a lot of money."[4] Others in the industry praised the magazine's design and concept upon its launch.[4] One central part of Good's business strategy was to donate its subscription fees entirely to charities.[4] Subscribers were offered the option to pick which charity their fees supported: organizations like Teach for America, Millennium Promise, Ashoka, City Year, and UNICEF.[5] Goldhirsh explained the reasoning behind the strategy in an interview with Inc. Magazine: "The idea was that we would incentivize consumers with the added benefit that their money goes to charity, incentivize these charities to reach their constituencies for the $20 donation, and enjoy the added marketing and public relations that would come from having an innovative strategy."[6] Goldhirsh's theory has been criticized as not a viable business model.[7] Another change from usual industry strategy was to use their marketing budget to throw parties rather than do direct mail.[4] Those parties have been reviewed and discussed by publications such as The Washington Post.[8] On August 17, 2011, a joint announcement was made that social network service Jumo, founded by Chris Hughes, would be merging with Good.[9][10] Around launch time in the fall of 2006, Good was featured in the New York Times and mentioned by APM's Marketplace.[11] The magazine and its web presence[12] were covered by NPR[13][14] throughout late 2007, when the company celebrated its one year anniversary. Good's listing of the 51 best magazines also received national press attention.[15] Good magazine is a four-time finalist for National Magazine Awards: twice for design (in 2008 and 2009) and once for the magazine's Transparency Section, which features infographics.[16][17] Good magazine has office locations in Los Angeles and New York.[18] The following is a list topics that GOOD.is has covered in its magazines:[19]
