You're the Guy I Want To Share My Money With is a double album released in 1981. The album is a collaboration by Laurie Anderson, John Giorno and William S. Burroughs, recorded during their "Red Night" spoken word tour of 1981.[1] Released through Giorno Poetry Systems Institute, the album was funded in part by grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts. Side 4 of this double album is a multi-grooved record. Depending on where the needle lands on the record, one of the following will play: Most of Anderson's material came from her performance piece, United States, and live versions of some tracks, such as "It Was Up in the Mountains", would also be included in her later 5-LP release, United States Live. This was Anderson's first substantial album release (previously she had only contributed a track or two), and she followed this in 1982 with her first full solo album, Big Science. You're the Guy I Want to Share My Money With was released on CD through Minneapolis-based East Side Digital, which acquired the Giorno Poetry Systems catalog in 1993.[1] The CD featured the following track list: Two tracks from the original 2LP set were not included on the CD: one by William S. Burroughs (later included on the Mouth Almighty 'The Best Of' box set) and one by John Giorno (still not included in any later release).
