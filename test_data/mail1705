The Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station (Romanian: Porile de Fier I, Serbian:  I, erdap I) is the largest dam on the Danube river and one of the largest hydro power plants in Europe. It is located on the Iron Gate gorge, between Romania and Serbia. The project started in 1964 as a joint-venture between the governments of Romania and Yugoslavia for the construction of a major dam on the Danube River which would serve both countries. At the time of completion in 1972, it was one of the largest hydroelectric power stations in the world with twelve units generating 2,052 MW, divided equally between the two countries at 1,026 MW each.[2] The small inhabited island of Ada Kaleh was submerged during the construction. The Romanian part of the dam was modernized and the nominal capacity of the six units was increased from 175 MW to 194.4 MW, thus giving an installed capacity of 1,166 MW[3] and increasing the entire power generation capacity of the dam to 2,192 MW. On the Serbian part of the dam, modernization started in July 2008 and is still in progress;[4] so far Unit 6 has been modernized, and revitalization of the remaining five is in the preparation phase.[5] The units are being upgraded with the help of Russian company  "  " (Ryazan Machine Tool Plant), as well as their subcontractors with the participation of eleven domestic companies. The Romanian side of the power station produces approximately 5.4 TWh annually, while the Serbian side of the power station produces 5.65 TWh.[2] The discrepancy in power output between the two halves is due to the generating equipment. While Romania's equipment is newer and thus more efficient (thereby generating more power), it is proving more unreliable; resulting in increased downtime for maintenance/repairs, and consequently lower annual power output overall.[citation needed]. In addition to the upgrades, the Serbian side is planning on building a new, smaller power station, called Iron Gate III (Serbian:  III, erdap III).[6]
