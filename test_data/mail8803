A Dudeney number is a positive integer that is a perfect cube such that the sum of its decimal digits is equal to the cube root of the number. There are exactly six such integers (sequence A061209 in OEIS): The name derives from Henry Dudeney, who noted the existence of these numbers in one of his puzzles, Root Extraction, where a professor in retirement at Colney Hatch postulates this as a general method for root extraction.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
