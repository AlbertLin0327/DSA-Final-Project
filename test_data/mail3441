The Battle of Leuze took place on 18 September 1691, and was a famous French cavalry victory in the Nine Years' War, against a superior allied force. Marshal Luxembourg was informed that William III of Orange had left for England in the supposition that the campaign of 1691 was at its end. He was also informed that Waldeck, who was left in charge, was preparing to retire into winter quarters. Marshal Luxembourg was near Tournai and sent out reconnaissance under Marsilly, that told him that the main body of the allied army was moving away, leaving a rear-guard of cavalry at Leuze. Luxembourg acted immediately. He send a detachment to follow the movements of the main body, and with the squadrons of Villars and Marsilly he attacked without warning. The French cavalry charged, only using their swords. The allied cavalry was superior in numbers, but could not deploy because of the limited space they were manoeuvred into. The allied infantry, including Mackay's Regiment [1] also took part in the battle but did not see much action. The battle lasted for only 2 hours, but was a complete victory for the French. The fleeing remainder of the allied cavalry was saved by troops sent back by Waldeck. Luxembourg had been in the thick of the action and had to beat off an attack directed at his person.
