Toronto Ability School was a private school for K-8, located in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.[1] It is unique as being the only Church of Scientology school of its kind in the area. It is now known as the Birchwood Academy and is a licensed Applied Scholastics School.[2] The school is notable for its public activism, and promotion of Scientology-related entities such as Applied Scholastics.[3] ==Notes== As of 2010 Birchwood Academy has closed down due to insufficient funding.
