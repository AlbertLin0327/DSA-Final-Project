Giuliana Setari Carusi (Pescara) is an Italian art collector. She currently lives in Paris, after many years in New York. Giuliana Setari Carusi and husband Tommaso Setari started in the 1970s a collection of contemporary art now well-known internationally. She is the founding president of the non-profit "Dena Foundation for Contemporary Art". Pescara, where Giuliana Setari Carusi spent her education years, is in contact with major artists as: Pistoletto, Kounellis, Fabro and Ettore Spalletti. Setari Carusi graduated in Modern Literature in Italy and obtained a Master's Degree in Administration and the European Union from the College of Europe in Bruges. She has spent most of her life in the United States and in Belgium. Since the time of her studies in New York, she has favored the promotion of Italian exhibitions abroad, sometimes using works from her own collection of Arte povera, thereby strengthening the market value of the artists. In 2001, she founded the Dena Foundation for Contemporary Art, a non-profit foundation, to promote young Italian artists and to encourage the international circuit of contemporary art. Young artists are invited by public agencies and granted scholarships to study in Paris and exhibit their works. She has been a juror of various prizes, at ENSBA[1] in Paris, at Hisk (Higher Institute for Fine Arts) in Ghent, at the Prix Fondation d'entreprise Ricard, and has been a member of the artistic committee of the Festival Europen des arts visuels  l'hpital[2] (Paris). She has worked as an editorial consultant for the multidisciplinary magazine Janus[3]. For twenty years, she was a member of Friends Supporting the Castello di Rivoli Museum of Contemporary Art in Turin and has served as president of Cittadellarte Pistoletto Foundation (Biella) since 1998 when it was created. Giuliana Setari Carusi, with the non-profit association Viafarini, the Studio Guenzani (Milan) and a group of collectors has sponsored the scholarship awarded to the artist Margherita Manzelli.
