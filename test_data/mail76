The South Euboean Gulf (Greek:   , Notios Evvokos Kolpos) is a gulf in Central Greece, between the island of Euboea and the Greek mainland. With a total length of approximately 50km and a width of 10 to 20km, it stretches nearly diagonally from northwest to southeast, from the Euripus strait, which connects it to the North Euboean Gulf, to the Petalies Gulf near Agia Marina in the south. Coordinates: 3820N 2350E / 38.333N 23.833E / 38.333; 23.833
