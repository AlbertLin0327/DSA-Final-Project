Potato (Thai: ) is a Thai rock band. The band won numerous awards for their popularity in Thailand. They released their fourth album, Sense, in 2007, and their fifth, Circle, in 2008. Their latest album is Human, which was released in 2011. Potato was formed by Peechanit Oan-Aari (Pee), Nantakrai Cham-Jaiharn (Note), Oranuch Tangdechavut (Nuch), and Suwatin Watthanawitukun (Bom). Potato's original vocalist was Peechanit Oan-Aari (Pee) but he died on October 3, 2002. This led to the dissolving of the band, but Potato soon reunited in 2003. As of 2008, Potato has a new drummer named Kan Uamsupan (Kan) instead of Suwatin Watthanawitukun (Bom), who left the group after the recording of the "Sense" album but still makes occasional live appearances with the band. Potato's current lineup includes Patchai "Pup" Pukdesusook (vocals), Piywawat "Ohm" Anukul (bass), and Kan Uamsupan (drums). The band's last guitarist, Rattanapon "Win" Keng-Rean, left Potato in 2010 and a number of guitarists from other bands having substituted for him since.
