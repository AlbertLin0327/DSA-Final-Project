In chemistry, inherent chirality refers to molecules and complexes whose lack of symmetry does not originate from a classic stereogenic element, but is rather the consequence of the presence of a curvature in a structure that would be devoid of symmetry axes in any bidimensional representation.[1][2] The expression "inherently chiral" was first used by Boehmer to describe calixarenes with XXYZ or WXYZ substitution patterns at the upper rim, and has been later extended to fullerenes with a chiral molecular framework, like C76, C78, and C84, non symmetric uranyl-salophen complexes and the protonated Schiff base of 11-cis-retinal, the chromophore of rhodopsin.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
