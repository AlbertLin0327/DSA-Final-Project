The laryngeal mask airway is a supraglottic airway device invented by Archie Brain, a British anaesthetist. Laryngeal masks consist of a tube with an inflatable cuff that is inserted into the pharynx. Laryngeal mask airways come in a variety of sizes ranging from large adult (size 5) to infant (size 1). The laryngeal mask functions as a "peripharyngeal sealer," in contrast to another category of supraglottic airways which are "base on tongue sealers," such as the Esophageal-Tracheal Combitube and the King Laryngeal tube (LT). A newer generation of the laryngeal mask actually utilizes both airway sealing mechanisms (peripharyngeal sealing and base of tongue sealing), and they result in higher average seal pressures during controlled and assisted ventilation of the patient. The apex of the mask, with its open end pointing downwards toward the tongue, is pushed backwards towards the uvula. The cuff follows the natural bend of the oropharynx, and is seated over the pyriform fossae. Once placed, the cuff around the mask is inflated with air to create a tight seal. Air entry is confirmed by listening for air entry into the lungs with a stethoscope, by presence of end tidal carbon dioxide and by monitoring the degree and pressure at which the air leaks around the mask in the oropharynx. Laryngeal masks are used in anesthesia and in emergency medicine for airway management.[1] The main use of the laryngeal mask is in elective anaesthesia, however it is also useful in situations where manipulation of the head or neck to facilitate endotracheal intubation is difficult (e.g.: trapped patient or potential cervical spine injury) or when intubation is unsuccessful. It is not inserted as far as an endotracheal tube (it sits in the pharynx, and thus does not need to be inserted into the trachea), and supports both spontaneous and artificial ventilation. It is popular in day case surgery. The laryngeal mask may be used for surgical procedures in any position, including supine, decubitus, sitting, Trendelenburg, lithotomy, or prone positions. However, anesthetic practice in the United States has largely limited its use to the supine position,[citation needed] whilst European anesthesiologists report its common use in lateral and even prone position cases.[citation needed] The laryngeal mask airway does not protect the lungs from aspiration, making them unsuitable for patients at risk for this complication. However, newer versions of the laryngeal mask airway now incorporate a drain tube that prevent most instances of aspiration after administration. [2] However, unlike an endotracheal tube, a laryngeal mask cannot protect the airway or lungs from aspiration of regurgitated material, and deep (subglottic) suctioning cannot be performed through the mask. Steps to improve the ability of the laryngeal mask airway have included recent improvements such as channels for gastric suction (LMA ProSeal, LMA Supreme, and modification to the laryngeal mask to allow it to guide endotracheal tubes through its respiratory gas tubing into the larynx (ILMA - Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway), thus protecting the patient against aspiration of gastric contents with the balloon on the end of the endotracheal tube (LMA Fastrach, Cookgas Air-Q).
