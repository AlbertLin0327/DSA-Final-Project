Mykola Kolessa (6 December 1903  8 June 2006) was a prominent Ukrainian composer and conductor, born in the village of Sambir near Lviv and died in Lviv. His father Filaret was a prominent Ukrainian ethnomusicologist and composer and his cousin was the celebrated pianist Lubka Kolessa. He studied in Prague under Vtzslav Novk and Otakar Ostril, and taught at Lviv Conservatory. His works include two symphonies (1949 and 1966), symphonic variations (1931), a 'Ukrainian Suite' (1928), all for orchestra, and 'In the Mountains' for string orchestra (1972), and a number of chamber and incidental works as well as some song cycles. His composition style was tonal and conservative and has been likened to that of Alexander Glazunov.
