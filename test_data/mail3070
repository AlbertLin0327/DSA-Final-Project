Leuvehaven is an underground subway station in the city of Rotterdam. It is part of Rotterdam Metro lines D and E. The station opened on February 9, 1968, on the same date that the North-South Line (also formerly called Erasmus line), of which it is a part, was opened. The station is located in the southern part of the center of Rotterdam, underneath the Schiedamsedijk, and near the northern end of the Erasmus Bridge.
