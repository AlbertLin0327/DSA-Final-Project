The DVW Husky was a rugged handheld British microcomputer issued in 1981 by DVW Electronics. It was designed to be used in harsh conditions, such as wet and cold weather, by users such as the military. It was waterproof and could be dropped from a considerable height onto a hard surface without sustaining damage. The computer was handheld, with a membrane keyboard similar to that of the ZX81, and a 32x4 alphanumeric LCD. The CPU was compatible with the Z80, it had in-built Basic, 32K RAM and 16K ROM. It was initially manufactured in response to a request from Severn Trent and was later used by the Ministry of Defence in the Rapier Missile project. It was superseded by the Husky Hunter in 1983.
