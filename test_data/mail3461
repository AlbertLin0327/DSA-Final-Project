The International Congress of National Minorities was an organization formed after the First World War to lobby for the rights of ethnic and religious minorities living in the nations of Europe and much of Asia, especially in the aftermath of the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, the German Empire and the Russian Empire. The body participated at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919 and later in the League of Nations. One of its most prominent leaders was the Zionist politician Leo Motzkin.
