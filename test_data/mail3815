Gerhard Berger (born 27 August 1959) is an Austrian former Formula One racing driver, who previously owned 50% of the Scuderia Toro Rosso Formula One team until he sold his share back to energy drink owner Dietrich Mateschitz in November 2008. Berger competed in Formula One for 14 seasons, twice finishing 3rd overall in the championship. During this time, he won ten Grands Prix, achieved 48 podiums, 12 poles and 21 fastest laps (two more than his former team-mate, rival and friend Ayrton Senna). With 210 starts he is amongst the most experienced Formula One drivers of all time. He led 33 of the 210 races he competed in and retired from 95 of them. Berger also has the unique distinction of taking Benetton's first and last victories, with eleven years separating them. He is renowned for his sense of humour and aggressive driving style.[1] Gerhard Berger was born in Wrgl, Austria. His father Hans worked in his own truck company with Gerhard later working for his father and before being promoted to a driver.[2] Berger, a multiple race winner in European Formula Three, moved up to Formula One in 1984 driving for the ATS team. He was fortunate to be alive after a serious road accident shortly after entering Formula One. A full season for Arrows followed in 1985, but it was not until joining Benetton-BMW in 1986 that his F1 career took off. Exploiting the exceptional power of the BMW turbo engine coupled with a clever Pirelli tire strategy, Berger won his first Grand Prix in Mexico using the Benetton B186. Berger was also on course for an easy victory at his home race, the 1986 Austrian Grand Prix before being forced into the pits from a comfortable lead with mechanical problems. Berger out-qualified team-mate Teo Fabi 124 in 1986. He established himself as a very fast driver in Formula One that year. Berger was also successful in Group A touring cars during this time for the highly rated Schnitzer team driving the highly competitive BMW 635 Csi. He won the 1985 Spa 24 Hours partnering Italian touring car ace Roberto Ravaglia and fellow Formula One driver, Marc Surer of Switzerland. For the 1987 season, Berger signed for Ferrari, partnering the Italian Michele Alboreto and replacing Stefan Johansson. After mechanical failures robbed him of the chance to perform, Berger came on strongly in the latter half of 1987, winning the final two rounds of the season. The 1987 Ferrari F1/87 benefitted from the work of ex-McLaren designer John Barnard although the car was designed by Austrian Gustav Brunner. Ferrari were back competing for race honours for the first time since mid-1985 from the Hungarian Grand Prix onwards. Berger was running a close second to Nigel Mansell at the Hungaroring before he was forced to retire. At Estoril for the Portuguese Grand Prix Berger dominated the race from pole position before spinning in the latter stages to finish second after pressure from Alain Prost. The Austrian then looked to be heading for a second consecutive victory at the Hermanos Rodriguez circuit for the Mexican Grand Prix as he once again dominated the race but mechanical problems forced him to retire when leading. Success at both Suzuka and Adelaide for the Japanese and the Australian Grands Prix, including pole positions in both events, ensured Ferrari and Berger went into the winter season with boosted confidence and both team and driver were tipped as favourites for the 1988 Championship. Berger out-qualified team-mate Alboreto 124 in 1987. The 1988 McLaren team of Prost and Ayrton Senna dominated the season, winning 15 of the 16 rounds. The Honda V6 turbo engine in the McLaren and Lotus had superior fuel efficiency. Berger was the only driver to break the McLaren stranglehold, winning the Italian Grand Prix after Senna tangled with Jean-Louis Schlesser, who had temporarily replaced Mansell in the Williams. Alboreto made it a Ferrari 12. This was a particularly poignant victory for the team, as it came just weeks after the death of Enzo Ferrari. The Ferrari F1/87/88C proved troublesome for both Berger and team-mate Alboreto especially in terms of fuel consumption from the 1.5 litre turbo engine. At the British Grand Prix for instance, Berger led the opening laps from Senna having already attained pole position, consequently building a large cushion over the rest of the field before having to slow to the extent where he finished outside of the points in 9th position. Berger was leading the final race of the season at Adelaide ahead of Prost and Senna before he clashed with former Ferrari driver Ren Arnoux in the Ligier while trying to lap the Frenchman. Berger out-qualified Alboreto in all 16 events for the 1988 Formula One calendar spelling the end for the Italian at the Maranello outfit. For 1989, Berger was joined at Ferrari by Nigel Mansell. The Ferrari 640 was fast but fragile, thanks in part to its revolutionary semi-automatic gearbox design. At the Brazilian Grand Prix, Berger tangled with Senna at the very first corner as the Brazilian found himself in a Williams and Ferrari sandwich with Patrese to Senna's left with the three drivers dicing for the lead. Berger was lucky to escape alive from a crash during the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola's Tamburello corner, where he went straight on into the wall at 180mph; the car spun multiple times along the wall before catching fire. It took 16 seconds for a rescue crew to reach the Ferrari and put the fire out. Suffering remarkably few injuries, notably burns to his hands, Berger was able to make it back to the cockpit at the Mexican Grand Prix after missing just one race. Berger attributed this to Ferrari's unique semi-automatic paddle shift gearbox, saying that his return would have been delayed if Ferrari still used the traditional gear stick transmission used in all the other F1 cars in 1989. With the exception of the Australian Grand Prix where both Ferrari drivers had poor qualifying sessions, Berger featured in the top four in all of the remaining Grands Prix but poor reliability and accidents meant that he only finished three races all year. He won the eventful 1989 Portuguese Grand Prix which was overshadowed by the accident involving Mansell and Senna and took two second places at the Italian and Spanish Grands Prix. Despite improving form from Ferrari, soon after Alain Prost announced his intention to leave McLaren at the end of the season, Berger decided to sign for the Woking based team. From 1990 to 1992 Berger joined Ayrton Senna at McLaren. His arrival was met with great anticipation as he had proven great form for Benetton and Ferrari. A McLaren-Honda seemed to offer Berger a genuine chance at the world championship for the first time. However, although generally quicker than his predecessor Alain Prost in relation to Senna in qualifying (he often qualified 2nd behind Senna), he was rarely able to match the brilliant Brazilian's pace during races. He took three wins in these three seasons, gifted the 1991 Japanese Grand Prix by Senna; as well as victories in Canada and Australia in 1992. During his three years at McLaren, Berger also obtained four pole positions and out-qualified Senna 8 times. His debut at McLaren ruffled feathers, as he outqualified Senna for the 1990 United States Grand Prix obtaining pole position. Initially, Berger complained of a lack of space in the McLaren MP4/5B for the 1990 season. Perhaps Berger's best drive of 1990 was at the wet and damp 1990 Canadian Grand Prix where he finished first, around 45 seconds ahead of the eventual winner Senna, but was penalized by one minute for creeping at the start before the green lights. Berger also started from pole position at the 1990 Mexican Grand Prix. Over all, 1990 was a disappointing season for Berger who failed to win a race for his new team, while team mate Senna won the driver's championship for the second time. Towards the end of 1991, Berger found his form in the McLaren MP4/6, out-qualifying teammate Senna at the Portuguese, Spanish and the title deciding Japanese Grands Prix (claiming pole position in the latter two events). In 1992, Berger finished a single point behind Senna in the Drivers' Championship using the McLaren MP4/7A. Berger deservedly won the 1992 Canadian Grand Prix having overtaken Riccardo Patrese's Williams and attacking teammate Senna before the Brazilian retired. During the 1992 Portuguese Grand Prix, Berger was involved in terrifying incident with the Williams of Patrese. Patrese not realizing that Berger was heading towards the pitlane touched the McLaren's rear wheel and went airborne, narrowly missing a bridge, before coming to a halt in front of the armco of the pitlane. Berger then went on to win the Australian Grand Prix for the second time after an exciting battle with Patrese. Berger therefore won his last race for McLaren and McLaren's last race with Honda engines. A lucrative offer from Ferrari proved too tempting for the Austrian who announced before the 1992 Belgian Grand Prix that he would be returning to the struggling Italian outfit. Niki Lauda persuaded Ferrari to bring Berger back to the Italian team in 1993 as Lauda felt Berger brought valuable experience with him from his partnership with Senna.[3] It was widely reported that Berger earned more than any other driver for the 1993 season. Berger was instrumental in bringing Jean Todt to the team as Team Manager, laying the foundations for the team's future successes. Todt attended his first event in his new role at the 1993 French Grand Prix. The active ride suspension made the car unpredictable to drive and the Ferrari F93A failed to record a single victory and spent the majority of the season competing for the lower points. Berger's best result was third position at the 1993 Hungarian Grand Prix. Berger had a number of spectacular incidents during the season including a clash with rookie Michael Andretti at the start of the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix and a dramatic impact with the armco at the 1993 Portuguese Grand Prix having just exited the pits. The 1993 Monaco Grand Prix was perhaps where Berger displayed his fighting qualities best of all, obtaining second fastest lap before he attempted an opportunistic move on Damon Hill's Williams at Lowes hairpin while challenging for second position. The Austrian was forced to retire. In 1994, Berger recovered from the deaths of close friend Senna and countryman Roland Ratzenberger at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, to score an emotional win at Hockenheim[4] for the 1994 German Grand Prix in the Ferrari 412T, the first win for Ferrari since the 1990 Spanish Grand Prix. Berger also scored two pole positions in 1994, the first at Hockenheim and then at Estoril for the 1994 Portuguese Grand Prix where he retired from while leading. A final season with the team in 1995 saw Berger score a number of podiums and was in a race winning position at the 1995 San Marino Grand Prix having qualified second before stalling in the pits but the fastest lap was a mere consolation. A particularly audacious pass on Damon Hill in Canada was just one example of his strong racecraft. Berger produced another aggressive drive for third having received a 10 second stop-go penalty for a jump start and then climbing up through the field from 14th position at the 1995 German Grand Prix, making a number of over takings on the way. At Monza having been in contention for the win, an on-board camera on team-mate Jean Alesi's Ferrari fell into the path of Berger and smashed the Austrian's front suspension. Berger out-qualified team-mate Alesi 125 in 1995. The departure of Alesi and Berger from Ferrari to Benetton also spelt the end of the number 27 and 28 era for Ferrari that stretched back to 1981 with Gilles Villeneuve and Didier Pironi only interrupted by the signing of 1989 world champion Alain Prost for the 1990 season. With the arrival of Michael Schumacher at Ferrari in 1996, Berger moved back to Benetton, although the team lost the competitiveness of the previous years. He could have remained at Maranello, but felt that the new Ferrari V10 engine would take too much time to develop. Berger spent his final two years in the sport at the team he drove for in 1986 while also sporting a revised helmet design, with the Austrian flag being rotated horizontally. 1996 proved to be a disappointing season for the Austrian, the handling characteristics of the Benetton B196 not being to his taste. Berger nearly won the German Grand Prix for the second time in his career before his Renault V10 engine blew up, handing victory to Damon Hill in the Williams. Berger's main problem for the early part of 1996 was his driving position that prevented a smooth airflow into the airbox. Consequently, Berger was significantly slower down the straights than team mate Jean Alesi. The Benetton B197 had a lacklustre opening to the 1997 season at Melbourne but the team and Berger bounced back at the 1997 Brazilian Grand Prix, with Berger finishing second having overtaken Mika Hkkinen and Michael Schumacher. Berger then scored Benetton's final Grand Prix victory at the age of 37, again at Hockenheim, coming back after a 3 race layoff following illness and the death of his father in an aeroplane crash.[5] As well as the victory, Berger also claimed pole position and fastest lap during the 1997 German Grand Prix.[6] He announced his decision to leave Benetton at the end of the season during the same weekend. He eventually retired at the end of the season, his final race seeing him finish a very close fourth in Jerez only seconds behind the victor Mika Hkkinen. In his final season as a Formula One driver, Berger and Alesi out-qualified each other 7 times each with the Austrian missing three races due to illness. Rumours of a Ferrari return for 1998 were false. Sauber offered Berger a drive for 1998, but the Austrian turned down the offer for a number of reasons, not least because of the new regulations for grooved tyres which the Austrian did not find inspiring. During the years that Berger was at McLaren (19901992), he became most famous for his humorous side. Popular accounts tell of many ingenious practical jokes thought up by the Austrian to break through his serious, focused and unyielding teammate Ayrton Senna. Senna accepted the challenge and as both were spurred on by team manager Ron Dennis, the practical joking escalated. Accounts tell of an incident at Monza where in a joint helicopter ride Senna had been showing off his new tailor-made briefcase. Having been made of carbon fibre composite, Senna argued that it was virtually indestructible. Berger opened the door of the helicopter and threw the briefcase out, to Senna's disbelief. Berger asserted innocently that he only sought to test the hypothesis.[7] Berger later recounted further events before the 1990 Australian Grand Prix. "After dinner, we started to throw people in the swimming pool, all dressed. As I was good at defending myself, I escaped from the bath, but many people got wet. Senna ran away to avoid us from getting him, however, later, I went to his room and he awkwardly threw a glass of water at me. For a Tyrolean, that was nothing, but it did mean that the game was now on. With a hose, we improvised an extension to the fire extinguisher and we put it under his room door at three in the morning. We invited some people to watch and when we pushed the lever, Senna flew out of the window like a rocket. It looked like a bomb had exploded inside the room. The confusion woke many people up, who started to scream at Senna for making so much noise. He was terribly embarrassed."[8] In an Australian hotel room Berger filled Senna's bed with animals. Senna understandably infuriated, confronted Berger, who replied, "Did you find the snake?" This incident prompted retaliation by Senna, who then proceeded to put a strong smelling French cheese in the air conditioning unit of Berger's room.[7] On another occasion, Senna and Brazilian compatriot Maurcio Gugelmin decided to fill Berger's shoes with shaving foam on a fast train ride to a dinner in Japan. The Austrian was forced to attend the dinner wearing a tuxedo with running shoes. A further incident followed in which Berger replaced Senna's passport photo with what Ron Dennis described as "an equivalent-sized piece of male genitalia". Senna's fame meant he rarely had his passport checked, but on a later trip to Argentina Berger's prank resulted in officials holding the Brazilian for 24 hours. As a response to this gag, Senna superglued all of Berger's credit cards together.[7] Another incident occurred years later at Ferrari, when Berger and fellow F1 driver Jean Alesi were taking a ride with team director Jean Todt's new special made Lancia roadcar at the very first testing day of the 1995 Formula One season. Arriving at the test track, Jean Alesi lost control of the car when Berger unexpectedly pulled the handbrake. The car flipped, skidding upside down to a halt in front of the entrance. Alesi was sent to hospital. Later when Todt enquired about his roadcar, Berger conceded the two had put some "slight curb marks on the roof".[8] The strong connection between Senna and Berger has extended beyond the Brazilian's death in 1994. Berger later acted as an advisor to Bruno Senna, Ayrton's nephew, who made his Formula One debut with the HRT F1 Team in the 2010 World Championship, and subsequently switched to Williams.[9] A hugely popular figure in Formula One, Berger was up until 2003 regularly seen in the pitlane in his new capacity as Competitions Director at BMW, overseeing their successful return to Formula One in 2000.[10] Berger was the first to drive a F1 car on the new Shanghai Grand Prix circuit when he demonstrated a 2003 Ferrari F2003-GA. On 25 April 2004; 10 years after Senna's death, Berger drove the JPS Lotus Renault 97T which Ayrton used in the 1985 championship for 3 laps, at Imola before the start of the 2004 San Marino Grand Prix.[11] In February 2006, he acquired 50% of Scuderia Toro Rosso in a business deal which saw Red Bull boss Dietrich Mateschitz purchase half of Berger Logistik, a road haulage company founded by Berger's father Johann in 1961. His Toro Rosso team won their first Grand Prix with Sebastian Vettel taking the win. He sold his share back to Mateschitz in November 2008.[12] Berger's helmet originally was blue with yellow lines and azure and white details near the visor In 1986, during his first spell at Benetton he used a different design that complimented the livery of the Benetton BMW. in 1987 his helmet is dark grey-blue featuring the Austrian flag on either side. For the 1995 Portuguese Grand Prix Berger sported a helmet featuring flags of multiple nations. The top was painted to resemble the Austrian flag and "NO MORE WAR IN THIS WORLD" at the rear. The special design was a result of a winning entrant for a one-off competition In 1996 Berger modified his original design with the Austrian flag rotated horizontally.
