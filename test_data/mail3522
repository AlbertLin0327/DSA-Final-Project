See article. The army ant genus Aenictus is an enigmatic group known from Africa, tropical Asia, and Queensland. There are some 100 species presently recognized, though many other names are applied at the rank of subspecies. This group has in the past been classified as the tribe Aenictini in the former subfamily "Dorylinae", or even as its own subfamily Aenictinae. Very little is known about the biology and behavior of these ants aside from the recognition that they do appear to be "army ants" in the broad sense (foraging via "raids", and no permanent nest site), and that they are closely related to the genus Dorylus, these two genera comprising the sister taxon to the New World Ecitonini.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
