The Dutch Tweede Divisie in the 1958/1959 season was contested by 29 teams, fifteen of which playing in group A, fourteen in group B. Teams occupying the lowest two places from each group at the end of the season, would have to play in a relegation play-off (however, two teams chose to relegate to amateur football immediately). That play-off would not be played this season, but in the next. The worst placed teams from that year would also enter. In the play-off (played after the 195960 season), teams would play against relegation to amateur football. The changes were part of an attempt by the KNVB to eventually make the Tweede Divisie into one league instead of two. Relegated from the Eerste Divisie Entered from amateur football  [Tweede B] Team moving to Tweede Divisie B next season. [Tweede A] Team moving to Tweede Divisie A next season.
