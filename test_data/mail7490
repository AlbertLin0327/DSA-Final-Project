Stillwater Bridge, is a bridge that carries Saratoga and Rensselaer County Routes 125 across the Hudson River from US 4.svgNY-32.svg U.S. Route 4 and NY 32 in the Village of Stillwater in Saratoga County into the Town of Schaghticoke in Rensselaer County. The bridge is two lanes wide and has a sidewalk only along the south side of the road. Stillwater Bridge actually consists of two separate bridges. The first one spans the Hudson River itself to Stillwater Island, which leads to Lock 4 State Canal Park at the mouth of the Hoosic River. The second one spans the Lock 4 Canal along the east side of the river to the mainland of the Town of Schaghticoke. The first major intersection on the east side of the bridge is Rensselaer County 120 wide.svg Rensselaer County Road 120 (River Road) which becomes Washington County 113.svg Washington County Road 113 when it crosses the Rensselaer-Washington County Line.
