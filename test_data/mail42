David Huish (born 23 April 1944) is a Scottish professional golfer, perhaps best known for being the halfway leader of The Open Championship in 1975. Huish (pronounced "hush") was born in North Berwick, Scotland. He married his second wife Diane in 1989 with whom he had a son, Oliver, in 1990. He also has two children from a previous marriage, Susan (b.1967) and Martyn (1969). Huish turned professional in 1959, with his first job being as an assistant at Gullane. He took up his first head professional position at Hamilton Golf Club in 1965. Two years later later returned to his home town to take up the same role at North Berwick Golf Club, where he remained until his retirement in 2009.[1] He was succeeded by his son, Martyn. As a club professional, Huish never followed a full time tournament career. Although he was regarded as a competent tournament player, it was not until The Open Championship in 1975 that he came to the attention of a wider audience. After qualifying for the championship in a seven man play-off, he shot rounds of 67 and 69 at Carnoustie to lead by two strokes over Tom Watson, Peter Oosterhuis and Bernard Gallacher at the halfway mark. However, he fell away over the weekend and ultimately finished 13 shots off the pace, in a tie for 32nd place.[2] His best finish in the Open came the following year at Birkdale, when he tied for 21st place. While Huish never won a top flight tour event, he did win many other tournaments, including the Scottish Uniroyal in 1971, and the Northern Open on four occasions. After turning 50, he joined the European Seniors Tour, where he enjoyed some success, claiming five victories, four of them in play-offs, with the last coming in 2001 when he won, again in a play-off, at the Bad Ragaz PGA Seniors Open in Switzerland. Huish later become a very significant and respected figure on the inside of professional golf, serving as the PGA Captain, a PGA Board Member and Ryder Cup Committee Member, a position he held longer than anyone else. In recognition of his achievements in the game, Huish received the Special Award at the Seniors Tour annual awards dinner in 2004 for services to golf.
