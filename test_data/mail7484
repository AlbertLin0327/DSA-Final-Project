Just like the Billboard painting performed in Pakistan, there is another indigenous form of art performed in Pakistan and it is the Truck Painting. With its all colorful floral patterns, depiction of human heroes with creative aspect ratios, calligraphy of poetic verses and drivers words of wisdom, this form of art is truly a part of Pakistani transport tradition[1] Many trucks and buses in Pakistan are highly customized and decorated by their owners. These adorned vehicles are considered as moving art, or jingle art. Because of their unique decor style, these vehicles are quite distinct in layout from other trucks around the world. Each part of the vehicle is decorated differently, with variations depending on the regional style. Although the decorative process is usually very expensive, it is still practiced throughout Pakistan as well as a few other countries of South Asia and Central Asia with great zeal and aesthetic zest.In Pakistan a truck driver/owner usually pays $3,000 to $5,000 for their vehicle's external decoration [2] This decoration includes structural changes, paintings, calligraphy, ornamental decor and more. Mirror work on the front and back of vehicles and wooden carvings on the truck doors are commonly used. Usually, the driver or the owner takes the truck to a coach workshop soon after its purchase for this decoration. The artist embellishes each truck according to the particular tastes of the driver.[3] The sides of the truck depict different scenes through their adorned artwork and may include metal "decoration pieces" which draw additional attention to the vehicle. The exterior of the trucks are often adorned with poetry.[4] Karachi is a major bedecking center for such trucks, though there are other hubs in Rawalpindi, Swat, Peshawar, Quetta and Lahore . Nearly every city in Pakistan has a unique dcor. The Balochistani and Peshawari trucks are heavily trimmed with wood. Rawalpindi and Islamabadi trucks have prominently featured plastic work. Camel bone ornamentation is commonly seen in trucks decorated by Sindh artists.[4] Thus these trucks are also representative of different historical and cultural regions of Pakistan.
