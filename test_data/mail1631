500 is a ball game for children.[1] It is played by one participant throwing a ball, and others catching it for points, and up to 20 children can take part.[2] This is a non-contact game.[3] The players include a thrower, and many catchers. The thrower will decide 'dead' (if the ball should touch the ground before being received), 'alive' (if the ball should be caught directly in the air), or either. The thrower also has the responsibility to determine the number of points that should be distributed. For example, a thrower calls out, "100, dead!" and throws the ball straight up in the air. All the catchers must wait until the ball touches the ground, before they pick it up, in order to receive the 100 points at stake. The player who reaches 500 points first is the winner, and will become the thrower, and the thrower will become a catcher.[4] The game can be played using a frisbee instead of the ball.[5] Kick Ball 300 is a variation where the ball is kicked as well as being thrown and caught. It was designed as a training exercise to promote cooperation in competitive games.[6]
