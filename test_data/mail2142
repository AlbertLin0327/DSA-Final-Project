Operation Marlborough was the code name of a mission carried out by a British-American Special Air Service (SAS) sniper team from Task Force Black, along with US Tier One Special Operations units such as Delta Force, in Baghdad, Iraq in July 2005. The team consisted of a 16-man SAS group, including 4 sniper teams, each armed with L115A AWM sniper rifles chambered in .338 Lapua Magnum. Escape routes were watched by the remaining members of the group in case of immediate emergency or escape if and when needed. As back up, Task Force Red, a Special Forces Support Group quick reaction force, was nearby.[1] The sniper team's mission was to kill terrorist insurgents wearing suicide vests laden with explosives that intended to target cafes and restaurants frequented by members of the Iraqi security forces, as gathered by intelligence obtained by Iraqi double agents working for the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and the CIA.[2] As the mission commenced, a United States predator spy drone (UAV) had the target building under video surveillance, sending its imagery back to the Task Force Black Headquarters. Listening devices had been placed inside the building and were being monitored by Arabic-speaking translators.[1] Assaulting the building was an option, but the team believed that it would be too risky, so instead they waited patiently for the insurgents to exit the building. If they had assaulted the building, it was possible for any of the insurgents to detonate a bomb inside of it, creating the possibility of harming civilians and destroying the building structure. It was vital to kill all three bombers simultaneously to prevent any of them from detonating their explosives, harming surroundings and civilians.[1] The insurgents exited the building at 8am, and the command to attack was given over the radio. The three SAS snipers opened fire; the fourth stood by for back up. All insurgents were killed simultaneously by shots to the head with the .338 Lapua magnum rounds.[1][2]
