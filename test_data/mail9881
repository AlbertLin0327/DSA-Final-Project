Dag Vag is a Swedish pop, reggae, and punk band formed in 1978. The lead singer was Per Odeltorp (1948-2012), popularly known as Stig Vig. Their early punk sound became increasingly more reggae-style. The band referred to it as "transcontinental rock-reggae". Their popularity peaked in the 80s, but they are still active. Dag Vag sometimes toured with Swedish punk band Ebba Grn and made a cameo in their documentary film Ebba the Movie.
