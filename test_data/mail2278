The 1988 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final was the 101st All-Ireland Final and the deciding match of the 1988 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, an inter-county Gaelic football tournament for the top teams in Ireland. Cork scored a goal three minutes in and Brian Stafford scored a controversial equaliser. Meath won the replay by a point.[1]
