HMAS Sprightly was a tugboat operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) between 1943 and 1953. She was built by the Levingston Shipbuilding Company, Orange, Texas during 1942. Sprightly was acquired by the Commonwealth Marine Salvage Board in 1942. She was commissioned into the RAN in 1943. Sprightly was paid off on 31 March 1958 and was finally sold on 29 August 1969 to T. Korevaar and Sons Pty Ltd, Williamstown, Victoria.
