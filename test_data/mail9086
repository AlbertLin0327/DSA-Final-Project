Angle Pole is a locality in the Northern Territory where the direction of the Telegraph Line changed to a more northerly direction.[1] It is also the eastern terminus of a still-born land grant railway from Roebuck Bay across the border in Western Australia. This railway was proposed by a London syndicate around 1889 and would have been about 1000 miles (1600km) long.  
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
