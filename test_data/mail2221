The Wargamer (Wargamer.com) is a web site specializing in war and strategy gaming. Online since 1995,[1] the site achieved recognition outside its niche around 2002, when it was recommended by PC Magazine[2] and the generalist gaming book The Rough Guide to Videogaming.[3] The site's importance for the computer wargaming genre, usually deprived of reviews in the traditional wargaming media of the time, was academically recognized in the same year.[4] The site publishes reviews that are examined by its editorial staff not only for readability, but also subjected to peer review for article's contents.[5] Today, The Wargamer is part of the Strategy Allies Network, together with Armchair General and HistoryNet.
