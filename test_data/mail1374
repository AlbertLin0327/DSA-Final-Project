WCHR-FM, known as "105.7 The Hawk", "Classic Rock for the Jersey Shore, 105.7 The Hawk" or in reverse "105.7 The Hawk, Classic Rock for the Jersey Shore", is a Manahawkin, New Jersey radio station broadcasting at 105.7 FM with a classic rock format. It is owned by Townsquare Media. WCHR-FM is the most powerful FM station in the Monmouth/Ocean market and can be heard as far west as the city of Philadelphia and Bucks County, PA, as far north as Wall Township, New Jersey, and as far south as Ocean City. The WCHR-FM antenna is co-located with WVBH and WKMK on a tower located near the intersection of Route 72 and the Garden State Parkway in Manahawkin. WCHR-FM is not affiliated with WCHR-AM, a Trenton radio station that currently broadcasts on 920 AM with a religious format; that station is still owned by Nassau Broadcasting. The WCHR call letters were originally associated with the Trenton station broadcasting at 94.5 FM, using a religious format (CHR standing for Christian Radio). In February 1998, WCHR began simulcasting on 920 AM, and in early Spring 1998 94.5 FM changed call letters to WNJO as it flipped format to Oldies. For more on the 94.5 frequency, see the WPST page. 105.7 was a Construction permit that Nassau acquired in 1998. When WCHR's religious unit moved over to AM 920 from 94.5 FM, the CP on 105.7 picked up the WCHR-FM call letters. 105.7 never employed the religious format. It did not sign on until 2000 when it took a similar Classic Hits Format that Nassau was airing on stations like WNNJ-FM and soon after on WODE and WNJO. Nassau gave Millennium Radio the option to buy the station in the deal that transferred the ownership of WJLK-FM, WOBM-FM, WBBO-FM, WADB and WOBM in June 2002. Nassau operated WCHR until its sale was completed a year later in July 2003. WCHR-FM's primary competition include Philadelphia's 102.9 WMGK and New York's WAXQ "Q104.3" both of which have a similar Classic Rock format and also cover much of Ocean County. In 2010, 105.7 the Hawk agreed to broadcast all regular season New York Jets football games.[citation needed]  Every weekday starts with the "10 at 10", ten commercial-free songs in a row at 10am. "Double Shot Thursday" features back-to-back songs from classic rock artists from 10am til midnight. Coordinates: 394258N 741731W / 39.716N 74.292W / 39.716; -74.292
