The Church of All Saints is a Roman Catholic parish church in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, located at 129th Street and Madison Avenue, Manhattan, New York. It was designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in January 2007.[1] The parish was established in 1879 and is staffed by the Franciscan Friars.[2] The parish was originally intended for the neighborhood's Irish immigrants.[1] As the neighborhood has changed, the parish today is predominantly African-American and Nigerian.[1] It was listed at its present address as early as 1892.[3] Known as the "St. Patrick's of Harlem" because of its ambitious design by the same architect as the city's St. Patrick's Cathedral, James Renwick Jr., also the architect of the city's Grace Church (Manhattan), Vassar College's Main Building, and the District of Columbia's Smithsonian Castle, Smithsonian Renwick Gallery.[1] The Gothic Revival, or alternatively Venetian Gothic, brick church with terracotta trimming was dedicated in 1893.[1] The design is festooned with rose windows in the clerestory and a prominent bell tower. "The vaulted interior is also rich in details, including comfortable hand-carved pews, murals and stained glass."[1] The parish school was among 27 closed by Archbishop Dolan in the Archdiocese of New York on 11th of January 2011.[4][5] Coordinates: 404830N 735618W / 40.80833N 73.93833W / 40.80833; -73.93833
