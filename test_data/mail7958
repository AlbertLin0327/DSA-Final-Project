The Greyhounds is a Commando force of the Andhra Pradesh state police raised in the year 1989.[1] The primary role of this unit is to fight left-wing extremism. They have played a major role in the decline of Naxalism in the state and have been involved in training similar forces in other states like maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, West bengal, Bihar etc.
