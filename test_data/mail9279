The New Zealand Food Safety Authority (NZFSA), or Te Pou Oranga Kai O Aotearoa is the New Zealand government body responsible for food safety[citation needed]. NZFSA is also the controlling authority for imports and exports of food and food-related products. The NZFSA administers legislation covering: In July 2007 the NZFSA was separated from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to form a new Public Service Department.[1] On 1 July 2010, the New Zealand Food Safety Authority (NZFSA) was amalgamated back into the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry[2]. Food Bill 160-2 was introduced on 26 May 2010 to make some fundamental changes[3] to New Zealand's domestic food regulatory regime. Significantly, for an export led economic recovery for New Zealand, the domestic food regulatory regime is the platform for exports[4]. The New Zealand domestic standard is used as the basis for negotiating equivalence arrangements with trading partners. This minimizes the excessive importing country requirements that may be imposed but which do not go to food safety. If passed into law and fully implemented, it would replace the Food Act 1981 and the Food Hygiene Regulations 1974. Food Bill will also make consequential amendments to the Animal Products Act 1999 and the Wine Act 2003 to improve the interface of regulatory processes across food sectors. MAF (through NZFSA) manages New Zealands participation in Codex Alimentarius and sets strategic priorities which ensure that Codex standards have the widest possible application.[5]   Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Department of Building and Housing Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority Department of Conservation Department of Corrections Crown Law Office Ministry for Culture and Heritage Ministry of Defence Ministry of Economic Development Ministry of Education Education Review Office Ministry for the Environment Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade Government Communications Security Bureau Ministry of Health Inland Revenue Department Department of Internal Affairs Ministry of Justice Department of Labour Land Information New Zealand Ministry of Mori Development New Zealand Customs Service Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministry of Science and Innovation Serious Fraud Office Ministry of Social Development State Services Commission Statistics New Zealand Ministry of Transport The Treasury Ministry of Women's Affairs
