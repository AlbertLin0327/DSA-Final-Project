 John Brogden (2February 1798  9December 1869) was a cleansing, building and railway contractor, railway promoter, a miner of coal and iron and an iron smelter. He was brought up on a farm near Clitheroe, Lancashire. As a young man he migrated to a rapidly growing Manchester and applied his farmer's knowledge of horses as a cleansing contractor. He worked in partnership with Joseph Whitworth to use the latter's patent cleansing machines. He also started the same business in Westminster. He seems to have extended his contracting work to building, for in 1838 he obtained contracts with the Manchester and Leeds Railway Company to build their Manchester station (now Manchester Victoria station) and the viaduct from there to Miles Platting. Other railway contracts followed. As the eldest four of his five sons came of age and joined him to form John Brogden and Sons he took iron-mining leases in Furness. They quickly saw that a rail link from Furness to the rest of England and Wales was critical to the industrial development of Furness so they promoted the Ulverston and Lancaster Railway to run across Morecambe Bay from Carnforth to Ulverston, receiving the Royal Assent in 1851. This was an innovative, challenging and risky project but it was eventually completed in 1857 and soon purchased by the Furness Railway. Beginning in 1853 the family expanded into South Wales buying mining leases and an Iron Works in the Llynfi and Ogmore Valleys. They developed these vigorously, also building a railway in the Ogmore Valley and a new harbour at Porthcawl. From an early age Brogden was a Methodist and in later life he contributed generously in time and money to Methodist and other good causes. When John Brogden died in 1869, his business was outwardly strong and profitable. However it failed spectacularly within ten years, under the leadership of Alexander Brogden, the eldest surviving son. He was born on 2February 1798 on his father's farm at Worston, near Clitheroe in Lancashire. He was educated at Clitheroe Grammar School.[1] As a young man he left home for the rapidly expanding town of Manchester. Whereas other young men at that time chose to work in the burgeoning cotton industry, Brogden was an outdoor man, fond of riding and hunting so he preferred to work in haulage and transport. For further details of his work see John Brogden and Sons. In 1822 he married Sarah Hannah McWilliams, only daughter of Alexander McWilliams of Hazelhurst near Ashton-under-Lyne. She had been educated at the Moravian School in Dukinfield [2] .[3] Their children were: John, born Manchester 1823, married Ellen Garstang 20March 1849 at Manchester Cathedral, died suddenly on 6November 1855 at his home, Lightburn House, Ulverston, age 32.[4] Lightburn House was later pulled down and replaced by the Coronation Hall.[5] Alexander, born Manchester 3 November 1825, married Ann Garstang 6 September 1848 at Manchester Cathedral.,[4] died 26November 1892 in Croydon.[6] Henry, born Manchester 1828, married Sarah Ann Marshall on 11September 1862 in Stockport, died at Hale Lodge, Hale, Altrincham, Cheshire in 1913.[4] James, born Manchester 7April 1832, spent most of his adult life in Mid-Glamorgan, first at Tondu and later at Porthcawl, where he died in January 1907.[4] George William Hargreaves Brogden, was born in 1842 and died in London in 1892.[4] All the above sons except George joined him in his business on reaching the age of 21. Sarah Hannah, born in 1834, married Samuel Budgett on 5June 1858, son and joint heir of the Bristol grocer Samuel Budgett,[7] died in 1905. Mary Jane, referred to as Jenny, married William Billing in Manchester Cathedral on 18 December 1867 and at one time they lived at Dunham Grange, Bowdon, Cheshire.[4] John Brogden (sen.) died at his home, Raglan House, Raglan Road, Sale (then in Cheshire) on 9 December 1869.[4][8] In his will he had set up a trust for Mrs Billing of 7,250 and previously a marriage settlement of 10,000. The trustees were: Alexander, James and Henry Brogden and Samuel Budgett. For five years from his death the trustees were empowered to use the trust money in the business but after that they had to provide good assets that were independent of it. They failed to do this and in 1887, after the failure of the business and its partners, Mrs Billing sued the trustees for breach of trust in the action "Billing vs Brogden".[9] She won the case and Samuel Budgett, as the only solvent trustee, had to supply the whole sum and the costs. This may have been a factor in his subsequent bankruptcy. Casson, Robert (1889), A Few Furness Worthies, pp.6668 Gilpin, L.R.
