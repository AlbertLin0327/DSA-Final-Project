The Arco Valley Pearl is a white 575 carats (115g) natural blister baroque pearl with pink and yellow overtones. It measures 79 x 41 x 34mm. It is the largest natural pearl outside a museum and the second biggest ever. Chinese emperor Khubilai Khan reportedly gave it to Marco Polo. During 2007, an UAE collectionner said he bought the pearl from a French owner for 8M US$ but it is still owned by a European company (August 2008).[citation needed]
