Marquess of Abergavenny (pronounced Abergavenny), in the County of Monmouth, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom that was created on 14 January 1876, along with the title Earl of Lewes (pronounced "Lewis"), in the County of Sussex, for the 5th Earl of Abergavenny, a member of the Nevill family. The 1st Marquess's ancestor, the de facto 17th (de jure 2nd) Baron Bergavenny, was created Earl of Abergavenny, in the County of Monmouth, and Viscount Nevill, of Birling in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of Great Britain on 17 May 1784. The Barony of Bergavenny was held by his successors, the Earls and Marquesses of Abergavenny, until 1938, when it passed into abeyance between the two daughters of the 3rd Marquess. The 6th and present Marquess is Christopher George Charles Nevill (b. 23 April 1955), the son of the late Lord Rupert Charles Montecute Nevill and Lady Ann Camilla Evelyn Wallop. He succeeded to the title in 2000 on the death of his uncle the 5th Marquess who had no surviving sons. Eridge Castle is the seat of the Marquesses of Abergavenny. Eridge is 38 miles south of London. The heraldic blazon for the coat of arms of the Marquesses of Abergavenny is: Gules, a saltire argent charged with a rose of the field (barbed and seeded proper). [1] These are the ancient arms of Neville differenced by a rose, the symbol of a 7th son, in reference to Sir Edward Neville, 1st Baron Bergavenny (d.1476), 7th son of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland. This can be translated as: "A white saltire with a red rose, all over a red background". There is no heir to the marquessate and the earldom of Lewes. The heir presumptive to the earldom of Abergavenny and viscountcy of Nevill is David Michael Ralph Nevill (b. 1941). He is the great-grandson of the Hon. Ralph Pelham Nevill, second son of the fourth Earl.
