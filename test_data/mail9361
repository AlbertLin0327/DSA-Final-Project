Catalog is a "best of" album by Tsukiko Amano, released on February 27, 2006. The album contains every A-side from each of her singles up until 2006. It was released in three editions: a normal, one-CD edition, a limited edition pressing with a card jacket designed by Amano herself,[1] and a Deluxe edition. The Deluxe edition came with an extra CD and DVD, and included the music videos for "Idea", "Hisui", "Koe" and "Love Dealer", as well as making-of footage for Amano's fifth anniversary single releases, part of the 5-five- DVD.[2] Combined sales of the two editions resulted in the album peaking at #24 on the Oricon weekly charts, and charting for three weeks.[3] This was Amano's final release with Pony Canyon; after the album's release her contract was terminated and she returned to indies releases. The album, released to commemorate Amano's fifth anniversary in the music business, was released through Otokura Records and distributed by Pony Canyon. The album was Amano's second compilation album, the first being Winona Riders (Tsuki no Uragawa), a B-sides compilation. The Deluxe edition was released on November 15, 2006.[2][4] It was later discontinued on March 31, 2007. The album contained a special application postcard for her then-upcoming "5-five-" DVD, and a lottery ticket qualifying the buyer for a raffle for a Kubrick of Amano. All songs on the album were written and composed by Amano herself and arranged by producer Hirotomo Togura, with the exceptions of "Joker Joe", a joint composition with Togura, and "Hisui", arranged by Shin Kno. Amano also chose the track order herself. All songs written and composed by Tsukiko Amano. All songs written and composed by Tsukiko Amano.
