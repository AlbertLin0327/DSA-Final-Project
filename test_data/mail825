The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (also known as the LVMPD or Metro) is a joint city-county police force for the City of Las Vegas and Clark County, Nevada. It is run by the Sheriff of Clark County, elected every four years. The current Sheriff of Clark County is Douglas C. Gillespie, who became sheriff in January 2007[1] and was elected to a second term in November 2010.[2] The sheriff is the only elected head law enforcement officer within the county, and, as such, the department is not under the direct control of the city, county or state. Metro is the largest law enforcement agency in the state of Nevada, and one of the largest police agencies in the United States.[3] The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) was formed on July 1, 1973, by merging the Las Vegas Police Department with the Clark County Sheriff's Department. Metro serves the city limits of Las Vegas and the unincorporated areas of Clark County. In 1999, an outside audit, commissioned by the City of Las Vegas and conducted by DMG-Maximus, commended the department for having fewer managers and supervisors than are typically found in large police agencies. The audit also said that the managers, both sworn and civilian, were of "excellent quality."[4] The auditors found that the recruitment and selection program was "among the best we have encountered in recent years." Although the city had planned to commission a second phase of the study, DMG-Maximus auditors said they were so impressed with the department that further study was unnecessary, saving the city $180,000 that had been allocated for the audit.[4] Currently, Metro has more than 5,100 members. Of these, over 2,700 are police officers of various ranks and over 750 are corrections officers of various ranks. LVMPD operates on a digital radio system (DesertSky), which was turned on in 2011. In 2010 the agency began a transition from the former analog system to this new digital radio system. The transition to DesertSky has been slow, and some analog frequencies will remain for outside access after full utilization. DesertSky is LVMPD's nickname for official name of "OpenSky," developed by what is now Harris Corporation. Construction was completed on LVMPD's new 370,500 square foot headquarters, located at 400 S. Martin L. King Boulevard, in mid-2011. The building facility consolidated 27 bureaus which were previously located in various leased buildings around Las Vegas. It also houses the Southern Nevada Counter Terrorism Center, Police Records, and a Fingerprint Bureau annex. The LVMPD and the agencies that existed prior to consolidation to form the agency, the Clark County Sheriff's Office, and City of Las Vegas Police Department have suffered officers killed in action. In 2006, Sergeant Henry Prendes became the first Metro officer in 18 years to be shot and killed in the line of duty. Officer Donald Weese died in the line of duty in 1989 as a result of a traffic accident, Officer Russell Peterson died in 1998 during a training exercise near Mount Charleston. Officer Marc Kahre was shot and killed in the line of duty in 1988. He was the 22nd law enforcement official to be killed on duty in Clark County since the City of Las Vegas was founded.[5] In the early morning hours of May 7, 2009, Officer James "Jamie" Manor of Enterprise Area Command was driving in excess of 100 MPH without flashing lights or siren and killed as a result of a traffic collision while en route to a possible domestic violence call.[6] Officer Manor was the 23rd officer in Clark County to be killed in the line of duty. On the night of October 7, 2009, Officer Milburn "Millie" Beitel and another officer in the passenger seat were both seriously injured in a single-vehicle crash. Officer Beitel died the early morning hours of October 8, 2009 due to his injuries. This incident came exactly five months after officer James Manor died in a crash in his patrol car. On November 19, 2009, Officer Trevor Nettleton was shot to death in his garage after exchanging fire with 3 men in a botched robbery attempt. Metro considers this death 'in the line of duty' as he drew his police weapon in defense of himself and family and has been laid to rest with full police honors. On November 21, 2009, Corrections Officer Daniel Leach, while on duty, was killed in a car accident near Searchlight, Nevada. The department is funded by both the City of Las Vegas and Clark County. Funding is based on a complex formula that includes population, calls for service, and felony crimes in the prior year. Both governments must approve the annual budget including their percentage of budget. Additionally the department itself generates approximately 33% of its funds through property tax, and the charging for certain services, such as special events, work cards, and privileged license investigations. Additional funding is generated from a special sales tax to fund commissioned positions. By state law, the sheriff of Clark County is charged with running the county jail, known as the Clark County Detention Center or CCDC, which is funded solely by the government and tax base of Clark County. There are two commissioned career tracks in the LVMPD. They have identical civil service rank structures and pay, but different day-to-day tasks and responsibilities. Major patrol responsibilities are covered by bike patrols, motorcycle units and patrol cars assigned to the following units: The LVMPD is divided into eight urban area commands: When Metro was formed in 1973, the Las Vegas Valley was served by only three area commands: North, South and West. Other major coverage details: The LVMPD rank structure is as follows: This department provides law enforcement services for all of Clark County, including the City of Las Vegas, yielding primary jurisdiction to the following agencies: The LVMPD is led by the sheriff, second in command is the undersheriff, who is assisted by four assistant sheriffs. The Office of Intergovernmental Services, the Office of General Counsel, the Office of Public Information, the Office of Finance, The Police Employee Assistance Program (PEAP), and the Office of the Sheriff Executive Staff report to the undersheriff. Four of the six elected Clark County sheriffs since the LVMPD was consolidated in 1973 are former members of either the Clark County Sheriff's Office (CCSO) or Las Vegas Police Department (LVPD). Former Sheriff Young and current Sheriff Gillespie are retired members of the LVMPD (that is they were commissioned solely as members of the LVMPD) Sheriff Gillespie rose to, and retired at, the appointed rank of undersheriff prior to assuming public office as the duly elected Sheriff of Clark County. The ranks of undersheriff, assistant sheriff, and deputy chief are appointed from the highest civil service rank of captain. These positions serve at the pleasure of the sheriff and as such, if they lose the confidence of the person who holds that office, they can be returned to their civil service rank of captain if they choose not to simply retire. Division directors are civilian appointees that head divisions as would a deputy chief. Of additional note, at various points in the department's history the appointed rank of Commander has been used between the ranks of deputy chief and captain. The undersheriff is second in command to the sheriff. The position is currently held by Undersheriff Jim Dixon. The Law Enforcement Services Group Assistant Sheriff (currently Assistant Sheriff Joseph Lombardo) oversees two divisions, each overseen by a deputy chief or division director. The divisions are: Technical Services Division (made up of the Criminalistics Bureau, Police Records Bureau, Fingerprint Bureau, and Logistics Bureau); Professional Standards Division (Office of Human Resources, Organizational Development Bureau, and the Internal Affairs Bureau). Additionally, the Information Technologies Bureau reports directly to Assistant Sheriff Lombardo. The Law Enforcement Operations Group Assistant Sheriff (currently Assistant Sheriff Theodore Moody) oversees 2 divisions, both led by a deputy chief. The divisions are: Detention Services Division (made up of the DSD Records Bureau, South Tower Bureau, Central Booking Bureau, North Tower Bureau, Administrative Operations Bureau, and the Staff Operations Bureau), and the Patrol Division (made up of the Downtown Area Command, Bolden Area Command, Northeast Area Command, Northwest Area Command, Enterprise Area Command, Convention Center Area Command, Southeast Area Command, and the South Central Area Command) The Law Enforcement Investigations and Support Group Assistant Sheriff (currently Assistant Sheriff Ray Flynn) oversees two divisions, both led by a deputy chief. The divisions are: The Investigative Services Division (made up of the Robbery/Homicide Bureau, Crimes Against Youth/Family Bureau, Gang Crimes Bureau, and the Financial/Property Crimes Bureau), and the Special Operations Division (made up of the Airport Bureau, Communications Bureau, Support Operations Bureau, and the Traffic Bureau). The Homeland Security Investigations and Support Group Assistant Sheriff (currently Greg McCurdy) oversees a single division. The Homeland Security Division is led by a deputy chief consists of the Southern Nevada Counterterrorism Center (SNCTC), Emergency Operations Bureau, Organized Crime Bureau, and the Vice/Narcotics Bureau. Area commands and bureaus are typically led by captains. The captains in turn manage a staff of 1 to 4 lieutenants who in turn manage a staff of 4 or 5 sergeants. Sergeants typically supervise 612 police officers, corrections officers, or detectives and civilian support staff. Sections are typically led by lieutenants. A typical substation or area command has a captain, three or four police lieutenants, sixteen police sergeants, and 130150 police officers.[citation needed] The department maintains an active volunteer program called the Metro Volunteer Program or MVP. The program publishes a monthly newsletter available on the department web site. MVPs are used within the department in any area that is not law enforcement as the volunteers are not law enforcement officers. The program was honored in 2011 as the winner for Outstanding Achievement in Law Enforcement Volunteer Program by the International Association of Chiefs of Police.[7] The LVMPD operates its own training academyofficially the LVMPD Recruit Training Academy, but referred to by members the department as 'The Academy.'[citation needed] New recruits are required to attend a 26-week academy. This includes those who have attended another police academy. The academy is composed of a hand-picked training staff of senior police officers who are recognized experts in multiple fields, including police academics, patrol tactics, procedure, defensive tactics/martial arts, physical fitness, and firearms skills. The academy is headquartered at the Jerry Keller Training Facility next to the Northwest Area Command station. The first 12 weeks are held at this location. During this initial phase, the recruits' training is centered around intense physical conditioning, basic defensive tactics, and academic classroom instruction. The remainder of the academy is located at the Mojave Training Facility adjacent to the Northeast Area Command. At this facility, the recruit's training becomes less academic-based and far more practical-application-based. The concentration of the curriculum focuses on intense defensive tactics/martial art instruction and advanced police tactics. It is also during this phase that the police recruit receives firearms training and the Emergency Vehicle Operator's Course. The LVMPD Recruit Training Academy is nationally regarded as one of the toughest police academies in the nation, both physically and academically.[citation needed] The drop-out rate is roughly 35 percent.[citation needed] In addition to police academics, the recruits must successfully complete a basic Spanish language program which is taught throughout the academy training. The LVMPD runs a separate academy for corrections officer. This academy is located inside the Clark County Detention Center (CCDC).[citation needed] and is similar to the police academy, but somewhat shorter in duration. Upon successful completion of academy, the new officers' training continues during an 19-week Field Training and Evaluation Program (FTEP), during which new officer rides side-by-side with a certified Field Training Officer (FTO) who grades and evaluates the new officers. The role of the FTO is also to train the new officer in real-world application of the skills learned at the academy in a student/master relationship. The new officer is assigned to a new FTO every three weeks for a total of 6 FTOs over two 'phases' (9 weeks Phase 1, 10 weeks Phase 2). The new officer must show a measured level of skill and competency to advance through the phases. The final three weeks FTEP are 'solo' weeks in which the new officer rides by himself/herself for at least two shifts per week under the close scrutiny of his/her final FTO. At the successful completion of the FTEP program, the new officer is transferred to his/her first duty patrol squad and is officially a police officer. From the day the recruit enters the academy to the day he or she completes training and is a solo police officer patrolling the street is 45 weeks. The LVMPD also places emphasis on its continuing training for its sworn police officers. LVMPD officers are required to attend quarterly firearms training and re-qualifications, quarterly defensive tactics training, a vigorous annual Advanced Officer Survival Tactics course, monthly 'back-to-basics' training, various required on-line classes per year, and an additional mandatory 10 hours of new training per year selected from a list of classes offered by the LVMPD or other certified agency. One complete shift every two weeks is also dedicated for squad-level training. This does not include special skill or specialized unit specific mandated training. The LVMPD encourages its officers to attend as much training as is possible to learn new skills and stay current with cutting-edge law enforcement techniques and tactics. The Emergency Vehicle Operations Course (EVOC) takes place at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Police officers complete their initial course of training for EVOC at the academy. Commissioned officers then must re-certify every two years during an additional 10-hour EVOC course. Motorcycle officers must initially attend and pass a 3 week police Motorcycle Riders Course. They then must re-certify every six months in order to continue operating a motorcycle for duty. The department also operates two Citizen's Police Academies.[8] One of these is a regular academy and the second is a Spanish Citizen's Police Academy. For individual unit specifics and detail see following section, "Specialized Unit Specifics." Organizational Structure in place as of December 2011: Detention Services Division (DSD) SWAT The LVMPD SWAT Team is a nationally respected organization.[citation needed] The team, composed of nearly 40 operators, is one of a handful of full-time SWAT Teams in the country. The team's main objective is to save lives, victims as well as suspects. They are on the cutting edge on the use of a constantly changing array of less-lethal weapons and munitions. Team members are highly trained and work in no less than two-man cells. They are referred to as Zebra units and not called the 'Zebra Squadron' as it is asserted by the narrator on an often repeated cable documentary. However, their designated LVMPD call sign is Z, phonetically in the LVMPD alphabet- Zebra. The individual officers are denoted by their seniority in the unit. Therefore, Z1 (or Zebra 1) is the most senior operator and Z37 is the junior. This nomenclature applies to other units within the department as well. LVMPD SWAT conducts their training both for LVMPD recruits and seasoned officers within the department plus visiting agencies from across the country. In any given year, they will respond to an average of 55 hostage incidents and execute over 365 high risk search warrants and/or arrest warrants. Traffic Also called 'Motors' is currently the largest of all-Harley Davidson fleet in the country[citation needed] and has over 160 officers assigned. Traffic does specialized enforcement as dictated by the Office of the Sheriff, on the freeways, main and secondary roads, and schools. Motors is responsible for the majority of the DUI arrests and citations written in Clark County. These units are called "Tom" units  with a 3-digit or 4-digit number (the first designating its shift, and the last two or three digits representing the officer's seniority). E.g. T3115 would be a swing shift (3) officer who is 115th in seniority within the unit. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has one of the oldest continuously-operating K-9 units in the United States.[citation needed] Currently, the LVMPD K-9 Detail has 21 officers (including three sergeants) and 21 patrol dogs, trained to locate human scent. These dogs search for suspects, lost victims, and evidence that suspects may have discarded. Seven are European bred German Shepherds, one Dutch Shepherd, and 13 are Belgian Malinois. LVMPD has 15 detection dogs, nine are narcotic detector dogs which are trained to locate marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin. They use hunting breeds such as Springer Spaniels and Labrador Retrievers. They also have six explosive detector dogs used to locate various explosives. In addition to the dogs assigned to K-9, LVMPD has six other narcotic detector dogs. Five of these dogs are assigned to the Narcotics Detail, Interdiction Team. They have one Springer Spaniel[disambiguation needed], and a Black and Yellow Labrador. The sixth is assigned to the Resident Section, Laughlin, and is a Black Labrador.[citation needed] Fallen K-9 Officers Firearms training takes place at the LVMPD John T Moran Tactical Firearms Training Facility located near Nellis Air Force Base.The facility is used by numerous local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. At the facility, recruits receive several weeks of firearms training during the academy. Commissioned police officers must attend firearms re-qualification four times a year. This re-qualification is for all firearms. The qualifications include known-distance targets and tactical courses of fire in both regular and low-light. The department operates the detention facility. It is used to house inmates arrested in their patrol area, with the exception of misdemeanors committed in the City of Las Vegas, which maintains its own jail. In addition, it also holds persons who are wanted for extradition to another jurisdiction, persons who are awaiting a bail hearing or trial, or those persons serving a sentence of 364 days or less. Since the late 1970's, more than 80 LVMPD officers and civilian employees have been implicated in documented instances of police misconduct or alleged criminal activity, with several incidents resulting in lawsuit settlements in excess of 1 million dollars apiece. The cases of documented misconduct are listed below in chronological order. Press reports indicate the department is more prone to fire its weapons at citizens than most other urban US police departments. The department ranked third behind Houston and Chicago, in officer-involved shootings per capita. During the period 1990 to 2011, the department reported 310 shooting incidents, 115 of them fatal. During this period three officers were killed in the line of duty. Although the local population is less than ten percent Black, about a third of those shot by the police are Black. In twenty-nine percent of the shootings, officers were shot at by suspects.[9] In the late 1970's, the FBI via the use of wiretaps found that police officers at LVMPD were passing sensitive intelligence to (now deceased) organized crime boss Anthony Spilotro about undercover activities which were aimed at getting information to indict Mr. Spilotro. Detective Joe Blasko who was assigned to the intelligence section of LVMPD was regularly leaking the details of surveillance activities and information on potential burglary targets. In 1978, the police department fired Joe Blasko, and as a side effect, produced a rift between the FBI and LVMPD as the FBI determined that the LVMPD could not be trusted with handling sensitive information related to organized crime in Las Vegas. A side effect to this issue was that Sheriff Ralph Lamb lost his re-election race in November 1978 to John McCarthy, who ran on a platform to clean up the image of LVMPD and to declare war on organized crime in southern Nevada.[10] In January of 1987, Sheriff John Moran reported the theft of 9 pounds of cocaine valued at $700,000 and travelers checks valued at $300,000 from a safety deposit box at Western Vault company (which was used by detectives as a 'flash roll' for detectives posing as drug dealers) and that two officers and the company owner was implicated in the thefts. Although the two LVMPD officers had unrestricted access to the deposit box, they were never charged after being cleared by a controversial local polygraph examiner and instead LVMPD focused their investigation on Grady Sanders, who at the time was a FBI informant. Mr. Sanders was eventually indicted on 11 felony counts, and after a two week trial was acquitted on all counts returned against him. The theft of who took the cocaine and travelers checks was never solved, and the missing evidence was never located (this incident also shattered relations between LVMPD and the FBI. As a result of the publicity regarding this case, Western Vault Company went out of business soon after the trial of Mr. Sanders.[11] In 1991, The estate of Charles Bush settled with Metro for $1.1 million after Bush died in 1991 when the lateral-vascular neck restraint was used to subdue him. The three officers involved in the death (including former Detective Gerald Amerson) were placed on trial for involuntary manslaughter, and that they were acquitted after a hung jury was returned on the charges in question. The charges were filed by then AG Frankie Sue Del Papa, and that the case itself was the result of the officers entering Mr. Bush's apartment without a warrant and without announcing themselves as police officers.[12] In June of 1995, Las Vegas resident (and coin thief) Andrew Dersch was beaten by LVMPD officers Brian Nicholson, Robert Phelan, and Sgt. James Campbell. After a trial, the officers were convicted, but the officers were given a new trial when District Court Judge Lee Gates found that one of the jurors had mis-represented his criminal record during juror selection. In October of 1997, Campbell and Nicholson pleaded no contest to the charge of conspiracy to commit assault with a deadly weapon (which is a gross misdemeanor under Nevada Law), while Phelan pled guilty to two misdemeanors, obstructing a police officer and battery. The agreement called for each of the men to serve two years on probation, and 400 hours of community service.[13] The three officers were fired by LVMPD, and in November 1997, District Court Judge Lee Gates disregarded the plea agreements which called for probation and community service, and instead sentenced James Campbell and Brian Nicholson to nine months, and Robert Phelan to six months in jail.[14] In June of 1996, LVMPD demoted Steve 'Whitey' Franks from Captain to Lt. and handed out three (3) week suspensions to Franks and Sgt Ronald Fox on charges of falsifying and forging documents at LVMPD.[15] LVMPD intelligence detective Robert Conboy was issued a misdemeanor citation after he allegedly shoplifted a cassette tape from a Target store. He faces termination, and Mark Beckerly was fired earlier this year after the officer was charged with misdemeanor petty larceny involving an $8.50 dry cleaning bill. The district attorney's office is prosecuting the case.Las Vegas Sun,"Metro officers struggle with morale and sagging public image," by Cathy Scott July 13, 1996</ref> LVMPD officer Michael Ramirez was arrested in October of 1996 on charges of sexual assault, open and gross lewdness and oppression after a couple claimed he forced them to perform sexual acts while he watched at a location near the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area.[16] In March of 1998, Michael Ramirez pled guilty to two counts of oppression under the color of office. The 30-year-old former officer admitted that on Oct 4, 1996, he used his badge, gun and the indirect threat of arrest to force the couple to engage in sex in front of him at an isolated spot near Red Rock Canyon, about 14 miles west of Las Vegas.[17] On December 28, 1996, an off-duty Metro officer, Ron Mortensen, murdered Daniel Mendoza in a drive-by shooting. Another Metro officer, Christopher Brady, was driving at the time. Mortensen received a life sentence as the trigger man, while Brady was eventually convicted of federal charges for his role and received a 9 year sentence (in July 2010, the Nevada Supreme Court upheld Ron Mortensen's murder conviction, finding that the murder was "premeditated, willful and deliberate")[18] LVMPD officer Art Sewall was arrested on February 8, 1997 and charged with attempted sexual assault and oppression under the color of law, both felonies, said Las Vegas police Sgt. Will Minor. Sewall was arrested following an undercover sting at a local motel. The investigation of Sewall was opened following a complaint received on February 6 alleging that Sewall was engaged in criminal conduct. After his arrest, officer Sewall was placed on paid administrative leave.[19] In March of 1997, Art Sewall resigned from LVMPD and in June of 1999 pled guilty to two felony counts of oppression under color of office, and charges of kidnapping and sexual assault were dismissed.[20] In 1998, an 18-year veteran, Sergeant Scott Ferguson, while on duty and using an unmarked police vehicle, exposed himself, by opening his trench coat, to two women. He was charged with two gross misdemeanors and later resigned from the force.[21] In November 1999, LVMPD Commander Charles Davidaitis was arrested at his home for DUI after crashing his Toyota Land Cruiser into a light pole, fire hydrant and chain-link fence before driving home. He also allegedly tried to have his wife take blame for the accident and initially planned to flee to the airport. Davidaitis, who was relieved of duty after the arrest and put on leave with pay, didnt cooperate with police when they arrived at his home. When they gave him two breath tests, his blood-alcohol levels were 0.214 and 0.215 at a time when 0.10 was the legal limit. He entered a no-contest plea to reckless driving and leaving the scene of an accident, both misdemeanors. He was also fined $800 and ordered to take a drunken driving class. After this incident, Davidaitis retired from LVMPD.[22] On April 19, 2000 Officer Nathan Chio stopped a car driven by Kendrick Weatherspoon as the car was registered to a felony parole violator. The officer reported thinking someone was hiding under a pile of dirty laundry in the back seat of the car. After ordering the person to show himself, Officer Chio fired twice into the pile. There was nobody in the backseat. Officer Chio is still on the force.[23] Lieutenant Larry Spinosa was suspended for two weeks by LVMPD for failure to inform his supervisors he was under investigation. Lieutenant Spinosa was arrested in June of 1999 for suspicion of Driving Under the Influence DUI in McCall, Idaho. He eventually pled guilty to the DUI charge, but prosecutors in Idaho allege he offered an Idaho State Trooper $2,000 to avoid the drunken driving arrest (the charge of felony bribery was dismissed by Idaho prosecutors). The internal affairs investigation revealed that Lieutenant Spinosa violated police policy by engaging in conduct unbecoming an officer and that he failed to notify his supervisors of the pending police investigation.[24] In January of 2001, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that 42 year old LVMPD Detective Vinten Hartung would not be charged with any sex crimes by the district attorney's office for having a sexual relationship with a 16 year old boy, but did remain under investigation for two lesser offenses: stalking and furnishing alcohol to a minor. Detective Vinten resigned from the LVMPD shortly after this story was reported in World Net Daily.[25] The family of French citizen Philippe LeMenn, who died while in the Clark County Detention Center in 2001, settled for $500,000 in 2003.[26] In 2001, LVMPD officer David D. Miller was seen on a video recording punching a handcuffed man, Frankie Davis, and breaking his neck in the backroom of the Las Vegas Club, and as a result, the LVMPD was sued along with the Las Vegas Club, which was eventually settled for $250,000.[27] Officer Miller received a 10-hour suspension as a result of the Internal Affairs Investigation, and required to undergo additional training.[28] On January 9, 2002, LVMPD supervisors stopped by un-announced at the home of officer Sean Curd to have him sign some paperwork, only to find him in bed, shaking, and so high he could barely lift his head. When they tried to have him sign some paperwork, they found fresh track (needle) marks on his arm. When narcotics officers were summoned to the scene, they found cocaine, steroids, and ketamine throughout his house. Officer Curd pleaded innocent that Wednesday to a single felony count of being under the influence of a controlled substance and eight felony counts of possession of a controlled substance. Before officer Curd was indicted by a grand jury on April 4, 2002, his supervisors recommended that he be fired.[29] Officer Jason Woodard was charged on February 12 with 8 counts of sexual assault with a minor under 16, 2 counts of open and gross lewdness, and 2 counts of lewdness with a child under 14 (the child now involved in the case is 18). Officer Woodward is now on paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation, had a preliminary hearing scheduled in Henderson Justice Court in September 2002.[30] LVMPD Detective Jack Brandon was charged with felony robbery and felony burglary in the holdup of two United Coin slot machine route trucks on Feb 22 at Rae's Restaurant and Lounge in Henderson, Nevada. Police were led to Brandon after the robbery when one of the witnesses wrote down the license plate of the getaway car and it came back to the car issued to the 14-year police veteran, a police report stated. Jack Brandon was placed on paid administrative leave that same day, and a internal investigation by LVMPD ruled Detective Jack Brandon, 41, violated the department's standards of conduct policy, said Sgt. Christopher Darcy, a Metro spokesman.[31] On April 23, 2002, ATF agents searched the home of LVMPD officer James Rexroad for evidence relating to criminal activity involving firearms, ammunition and firearms-related items, 15 bottles of pills were found along with a bottle of steroids, according to a Henderson Police affidavit for a warrant. Two counts of possession of a controlled substance  felonies  and five counts of possession of dangerous drugs  gross misdemeanors  were approved by the Clark County District Attorney's office, said Ron Bloxham, a chief deputy district attorney. An internal investigation was started by LVMPD, and he was placed on paid administrative leave when the suspected steroids and pills were found. On June 25, 2002, James Rexroad resigned from the LVMPD.[32] In 2003, Sheriff Bill Young received an anonymous letter regarding members of a squad (which some would recall as rogue) headed by officer Brian Hartman (who was acting as unofficial leader of this squad), and prior to this incident, officer Hartman was involved in the fatal shooting of Orlando Barlow (who was unarmed) in the back. The squad that officer Hartman belonged to had no fewer than 37 warnings about such things as use of force, citizen complaints, and other issues that were tracked by LVMPD. An internal investigation revealed that the officers were celebrating Barlow's death. They had printed T-shirts depicting Hartman's rifle and the initials B.D.R.T. (Baby's Daddy Removal Team), a racially charged term and reference to Barlow, who was Black and who was watching his girlfriend's children before he was shot. As a result, graveyard shift officers Hartman, Krogh and James Vargas resigned or were fired, and another officer was disciplined. The sergeant was demoted, the lieutenant was suspended without pay and the area command's captain was transferred.[33] Sergeant Paul Pagano was arrested in 2003 on charges of driving under the influence DUI by officers of the LVMPD, and is no longer with the LVMPD, and has been arrested on two subsequent charges of DUI since leaving the employ of LVMPD.[34] In June of 2003, two LVMPD corrections officers, Alan Hirjak, and Christopher Brinkley threw lit firecrackers into inmate areas at the Clark County Detention Center, which prompted a federal lawsuit by four former CCDC inmates against the two officers, and their supervisor, Sergeant P.J. Leeke. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2006 by U.S. District Judge James Mahan, but was re-instated by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2008, and at that time, Sergeant Leeke was removed from the lawsuit. The settlement case called for LVMPD to pay $8,000 to the former inmates, and the two corrections officers will pay $7,500 each out of their own pocket. An internal affairs investigation resulted in Mr. Hirjak serving a 160 hour suspension without pay, and Mr. Brinkley a 120 hour suspension without pay. Then-Sheriff Bill Young described the incident as a "practical joke gone awry." The two officers returned to work after serving their suspensions.[35] In July 2003, a off-duty LVMPD dispatcher, Cynthia Thomas, reported a suspected drunk driver and followed the driver to Fellini's restaurant. LVMPD officers responded to the restaurant and Ms. Thomas approached the driver, Janet Moncrief, and that the husband of Cynthia Thomas was personally affiliated with Janet Moncrief's political opponent. After conducting field sobriety tests, the responding LVMPD officers determined that the complaint of Ms. Moncrief being under the influence was unsubstantiated. Ms. Moncrief then filed a complaint with LVMPD that she was personally singled out and embarrassed by the contact at Fellini's restaurant. LVMPD's investigation showed that Ms. Thomas' husband was personally affiliated with Ms. Moncrief's political opponent (at the time, Ms. Moncrief was running for a seat on the Las Vegas City Council), and that Ms. Thomas has used her position as a LVMPD dispatcher to obtain an unauthorized criminal history on Janet Moncrief. As a result of the investigation, Sheriff Bill Young terminated Ms. Thomas on December 19, 2003, and had engaged in acts of dishonesty related to the report of Moncriefs alcohol consumption and during the ensuing investigation into Janet Moncriefs complaint. Ms. Thomas went to arbitration claiming that she was unjustly terminated by LVMPD. On April 28, 2004, the arbitration panel upheld the firing of Ms. Thomas by LVMPD.[36] On July 1, 2004, LVMPD Sergeant Lawrence Montero was arrested on charges of felony obstruction and battery of a police officer after officers from LVMPD and the Henderson (Nevada) police departments wanted to talk with him, but Sergeant Montero sped away and after a brief scuffle, was taken into custody at a gas station. Sergeant Montero spent one night in jail and was released after posting $4,000 in bail.[37] In August of 2004, LVMPD Detective George "Gregg" Pease was charged with the criminal offenses of using police vehicles for personal use and misuse of a gasoline credit card. Prior to this arrest, Detective Pease was involved in three previous officer involved shootings (all fatal) in 1991, 1992, and 1996. George Pease was placed on administrative leave with paid on June 1, 2004 by LVMPD, and as of February 2012, is no longer employed by the LVMPD in any capacity.[38] On August 2, 2004, Metro police responded to a report from his roommate that Keith Tucker was acting strangely. In the resulting confrontation, Tucker was beaten, handcuffed, and when he continued to resist, tasered. He was taken to the hospital where he was found to be dead. A postmortem examination showed he was under the influence of cocaine at the time of his death. The matter is working its way through the courts as a civil matter.[39] LVMPD Vice Detective George Godfrey was arrested in January of 2005 on charges he tried to seduce a 14 year old girl during a sting operation at the girl's home when he propositioned the girl. He was charged with: using technology to lure children, burglary with intent to commit a felony, and attempted statutory sexual seduction. Godfrey had told the girl he had connections in the pornography industry and wasn't really into "the cop thing". Godfrey was relieved of duty without pay pending the outcome of the investigation. He was released on bail January 14, 2005.[40] In 2005, Mark Lilly was paid $24,999 by the LVMPD as a result of being arrested in July of 2004 when he claimed that LVMPD officers planted drugs on him to train drug sniffing dogs. Canine Officer David Newton placed real drugs in Lilly's car, but forgot to remove the drugs after the training exercise was completed. It was after other officers searched his car that Mr. Lilly was arrested for possession of drugs. Officer Newton realized his mistake, and sent a notice to the prosecutor handling the case, but internal affairs determined that the notice was never received. Additionally, when police officers David Parker and Kevin Collmar testified during Mr. Lilly's preliminary hearing, they never mentioned that Mr. Lilly's possession charge should have been dropped. A LVMPD citizen review panel recommended that Officers Parker and Collmar should be terminated, and that Officer Newton receive a 4 month suspension; the three officers were suspended without pay for a indeterminate period of time. As a result of this case, Sheriff Bill Young ended the long-standing practice of placing drugs in law-abiding citizens cars (for the purpose of training) in April of 2005.[41] In 2006, LVMPD Officer Eric Barros was sentenced to 3 years probation for theft and falsifying evidence during a drug raid. Prior to this, officer Barros had been involved in two previous police shootings in 1999, and 2001. He is no longer employed by the LVMPD.[42] LVMPD officer James L. Breed drove to Arizona and passed approximately 40 false prescriptions for pain pills at several pharmacies. In June of 2007, officer Breed was arrested on multiple charges of illegally buying narcotics, and in November of 2007, James Breed resigned from the LVMPD, closing out a 15 year career in which he earned the Medal of Honor, and the Top Cop award in 2005. Mr. Breed was sentenced to four years probation and 500 hours of community service on March 31, 2008, and additionally serve six months on house arrest or an additional 350 hours of community service. Mr. Breed explained his addiction to pain killers as a result of a vehicle collision with a criminal suspect, breaking his collarbone and right wrist.[43] In July of 2007, Raymond Yeghiazarian was killed in a motor vehicle crash in which LVMPD officer Jared Wicks was traveling through an intersection between 60 to 75 miles per hour (the posted limit is 45 MPH) while pursuing a white van and was not using emergency lights or siren (this according to experts). A Clark County Jury in August 2011 awarded a payment of 2.2 million dollars to the relatives of Raymond Yeghiazarian, but this amount was reduced to 250,000 dollars by a judge (being that the maximum civil payment allowed under state law is $250,000). The award itself is being appealed by LVMPD to the Nevada Supreme Court (as of February 2012). The civil attorney for Raymond Yeghiazarian has filed a new civil case in US federal court for 7 million in damages (there are no monetary limitations on awards in federal court), and that LVMPD detectives have been biased in their investigation of this traffic crash (note  the jury in the above case did find that Mr. Yeghiazarian was at least 25 percent responsible as to the cause of the crash).[44] An internal investigation by LVMPD found that Lieutenant Sean Donnelly abused overtime in 2006 and 2007 in the amount of approximately $1,800. The internal affairs department recommended firing Lieutenant Donnelly (according to Sheriff Douglas Gillespie, but Sean Donnelly chose to retire on July 5, 2007 before the investigation was complete. The investigation showed that Donnelly had violated the overtime policy, the police department's truthfulness policy and had engaged in conduct unbecoming an officer.[45] LVMPD Officer William Miller was arrested by officers of the Henderson Police Department on charges of domestic violence and coercion in 2008. He was convicted of battery and is no longer employed by LVMPD. Officer Miller was previously involved in the shooting (non-fatal) of a suspected car-jacker named Robert Lee Walker in July of 2004.[46] On August 7, 2009, LVMPD Lt. Robert Sebby was suspended pending an Internal Affairs investigation. Lt. Sebby has been employed by LVMPD since 1989, and was most recently assigned to the financial crimes section. Assistant Sheriff Raymond Flynn would not comment further on the investigation of Lt. Sebby.[47] Lt. Robert Sebby retired from the LVMPD, but the outcome of the investigation was never revealed, and on June 29, 2011, Robert Sebby died at the age of 49.[48] During Labor Day weekend in 2009, LVMPD Officer Lourdes Smith was caught aiming a rifle shaped BB-Gun at a neighbor's surveillance camera and firing, but missed the camera by approximately 8 inches. As a result of the incident, the Henderson Police department charged Smith on misdemeanor charges of damaging other property and using an imitation firearm in a manner that would be threatening if the firearm was real. Officer Smith turned herself in and was arrested, and that LVMPD Internal Affairs had started an investigation into the matter. Additionally, Officer Smith was placed in an administrative job where she will not have any contact with the public.[49] On September 11, 2009, Officer Jesse Gerstel and his partner made a routine traffic stop on the crowded Las Vegas Strip. The policemen ordered the driver, Erik Perez, to turn off his engine, but instead he drove away. Although the area was crowded with pedestrians and other drivers, Gerstel opened fire shooting out the back window of the car. The shooting was ruled unjustified. Officer Gerstel was arrested on charges of domestic violence (unrelated to this shooting incident), and is no longer employed by LVMPD.[50] In November 2009, LVMPD Officer Kevin Koval used a lateral-vascular neck restraint (commonly referred to as a choke-hold) to subdue Dustin Boone (who was behaving erratically and had not been taking medication) after entering his home through a unlocked sliding door. The finding of the coroner's inquest found that the death was 'excusable' (which means accidental), and that Sheriff Gillespie had been advised on the manner of entry to the home, and what kind of risk Mr. Boone actually posed to the public. On May 23, 2011, the LVMPD fiscal affairs committee approved a $1,000,000 settlement with James, Dorothy, and Michelle Boone (all relatives of Dustin Boone).[51] The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported on November 15, 2009, that LVMPD Lt. Benjamin Kim (known at the police department as the 'Mayor of Chinatown') is the target of a corruption investigation by both the FBI and LVMPD with regards to dealings in an ongoing HOA scandal in Southern Nevada. Additionally, his name has surfaced in an ongoing investigation of the Courthouse Cafe', which was located in the Regional Justice Center in Las Vegas, Nevada (it has since closed, and is now a Capriotti's Sandwich Shop).[52] On May 4, 2012, former LVMPD Lt. Benjamin Kim pleaded guilty in federal court to a charge of misprision of felony "for their concealment of an attempt to commit bank fraud," according to court papers filed by federal prosecutors that were unsealed on Friday. This guilty plea was in relation to the investigation of the Courthouse Cafe', and is an offshoot of the ongoing HOA investigation in Southern Nevada.[53] The Las Vegas Sun reported on November 28, 2009, that twelve LVMPD employees since 2005 were found to be improperly accessing and disseminating criminal history information for reasons unrelated to police work. The revelation came to light as a result of a lawsuit filed by Steven Quinn against LVMPD about obtaining DMV and police information about him improperly. A separate lawsuit against Officers Paul Osuch and Kai Degner revealed that Officer Osuch was the source of information leak at LVMPD, and that Osuch retired before he could be interviewed about the matter by LVMPD. Kai Degner was demoted from detective duty back to patrol status as a result of findings by LVMPD internal affairs officers.[54] In May of 2010, two LVMPD officers, Aron Carpenter and Andrew Charles Ubbens were charged by the Clark County District Attorney office with reckless driving in the death of motorist Ivan Carrillo. Carpenter was charged with felony reckless driving and misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter, while Ubbens was charged with misdemeanor reckless driving.[55] In July of 2011, a Clark County Jury returned a finding of not guilty to both charges faced by former officer Aron Carpenter, who was terminated by LVMPD during March of 2011.[56] On June 6, 2010, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that LVMPD Lieutenant Steve Menger was at the center of a felony narcotics investigation (confirmed by several law enforcement sources) as a result of collecting thousands of Oxycontin, Lortab, and Vicodin pills using phony prescriptions written out of a local doctor's office (a search of Menger's residence recovered large quantities of the above-described painkillers).[57] On June 11, 2010 Detective Bryan Yant, was involved in a controversial fatal shooting of Trevon Cole[58] was reassigned to duty as a desk officer following findings that officer Yant violated several several police department policies regarding the preparation and serving of the warrant, in addition to several minor violations.[59] Yant had shot at least three other person in the line of duty up to that point.[60] On January 18, 2012, the family of Trevon Cole (who had been killed by Yant) received a settlement from the LVMPD fiscal affairs committee of 1.7 million dollars (which is the highest amount ever awarded by LVMPD). In addition, it was shown that Bryan Yant made several mistakes when he focused on Trevon Cole and that David Roger (former District Attorney for Clark County, Nevada) and other prosecutors did not believe Bryan Yant's accounting of the shooting.[61] In July 2010, the LVMPD Fiscal Affairs Committee settled with Calvin Darling, who was initially accused of drunken driving and failure to yield in the death of Officer James Manor for $120,000. The initial reports that Officer Manor had his lights and siren on were incorrect and that Calvin Darling had a blood alcohol level of .035 after being tested (the legal definition for DUI in Nevada is 0.08%). In addition, the Clark County District Attorney office dropped all charges against Mr. Darling.[62] In August of 2010, LVMPD officer Thomas Mendiola gave a Ruger firearm, and ammunition to Robert Justice, a twice convicted felon as a gift for working on Mendiola's car. As a convicted felon, Mr. Justice is prohibited from possessing firearms of any type in the state of Nevada. Officer Mendiola was charged in January of 2011 with one felony count of furnishing a firearm to a prohibited person. Mendiola was relieved of duty without pay pending the outcome of the criminal complaint against him. In February 2011, Thomas Mendiola failed to complete his probationary period with LVMPD and was terminated as a result.[63] On May 10, 2012, Thomas Mendiola entered into a plea agreement in which he plead guilty to a gross misdemeanor charge of conspiring to dispose of a firearm to a prohibited person, and was fined $2,000 by District Judge Douglas Herndon. The felony charge that Mendiola was facing was dismissed as a result of the plea agreement.[64] The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported on November 25, 2010 that Lieutenant Paul C. Page, chairman of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Managers and Supervisors Association union has been relieved of his duties and placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation into allegations of misappropriation of union funds.[65] A follow up article shows that LVMPD closed the case against Lieutenant Page was quietly closed without filing charges that he misappropriated $38,521 from the association. Mr. Page also filed for a disability pension shortly after being suspended and while a member of the PERS board. In addition, an internal affairs investigation conducted by LVMPD sustained charges of 'Conduct Unbecoming an Officer'.[66] In 2010, the Clark County Commission approved changes to the coroner's inquest process that looks into deaths caused by police officers. The move came on the heels of the shooting death by a police officer of an unarmed Trevon Cole, in his home during the execution of a search warrant. In another high-profile officer-involved shooting that prompted the commission's move, Eric Scott, who had a gun, was killed at a large discount store in what became a high-profile case.[67] On October 18, 2010, LVMPD officer Roberto Angulo was arrested on a domestic battery charge by Henderson Police department officers after he pushed his ex-girlfriend into a stucco wall and bit her nose during an argument about the custody of their child. Officer Angulo was booked into the Henderson City Jail, and was released after posting bail of $3,137, and was placed on paid administrative leave, said officer Jacinto Rivera, a LVMPD spokesman.[68] LVMPD undercover officer David Denton was arrested on November 30, 2010 on suspicion of DUI after crashing his department vehicle into a median near Green Valley and Horizon Ridge parkways in Henderson, Nevada. Officer Denton has been employed by LVMPD for approximately 10 years, and was placed on administrative leave by LVMPD.[69] The police union advised its members, starting in 2010, to no longer cooperate with coroner's inquests of police shootings.[70] Two LVMPD officers, Brad Gallup and Jake Grunwald were placed on paid administrative leave in January of 2011 due to being stopped speeding in Northwest Arizona by officers who thought it was unusual that a LVMPD police vehicle in Arizona, and that the vehicle might have been stolen. The officers face discipline for numerous policy violations, including neglect of duty and abandonment of their post. The violations eventually resulted in each officer being suspended for one week without pay (which is the most severe penalty which can be imposed, short of termination).[71] On March 20, 2011, LVMPD Officer Derek Colling was involved in the beating and arrest of videographer Mitchell Crooks who Officer Colling approached when he observed Crooks filming a police investigation of a reported burglary. Mitchell Crooks has no criminal record in Nevada and, charges of obstructing a police officer and resisting arrest were dismissed by Clark County Justice Court. A claim of excessive force was made to the Internal Affairs division of LVMPD, and on July 29, 2011, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that Officer Colling violated several department policies, and that Mitchell Crook's excessive force complaint was sustained, Deputy Chief Gary Schofield reported. On December 13, 2011, officer Colling was terminated from his position at LVMPD.[72]. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported on March 26, 2012, that the LVMPD Fiscal Affairs Committee paid Mitchell Crooks the amount of $100,000 in order to settle a federal lawsuit filed by Crooks over his beating at the hands of former LVMPD officer Derek Colling. In addition, Derek Colling has appealed to an arbitrator in hopes of regaining employment with LVMPD (according to Sheriff Doug Gillespie) and should know within 30 to 60 days if he will be re-hired.[73] On May 26, 2011, LVMPD detective Timothy Nicothodes was driving 98 MPH when he crashed into the back of a pickup truck while driving in Yellowstone County, Montana. Subsequent tests show that his blood alcohol level was between 0.192 and 0.219 percent (the legal limit for DUI in Montana is 0.08 percent). As a result of the charges of DUI, and criminal endangerment, he was placed on administrative leave without pay per LVMPD policy. It was reported on February 17, 2012, that detective Nicothodes plead guilty to DUI, and no contest to criminal endangerment. As a result of his guilty plea, he now faces a pre-termination hearing in March of 2012 (per LVMPD policy, any officer convicted of a felony will be terminated).[74] On May 22, 2011, LVMPD officer James Anthony Segura was arrested on counts of battery domestic violence-strangulation and shooting into an occupied structure after his ex-wife accused him of strangling her. Segura was placed on paid administrative leave by LVMPD the same day.[75] On July 8, 2011, the sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, Doug Gillespie, along with Assistant Sheriff Ray Flynn, and LVMPD Crime Lab Executive Director Linda Krueger admitted a case of human error involving switched DNA samples by criminalist Terry Cook sent an innocent man named Dwayne Jackson to the Nevada State Prison for a period of 4 years for a crime he did not commit (it turns out his cousin was the actual culprit). David Chesnoff, a local attorney handing Mr. Jackson's civil lawsuit against the department stated that he is a remarkable young man, who is forward thinking and is not bitter. Steve Sisolak, a Clark County commissioner for district "G" and a member of LVMPD's fiscal affairs committee stated that the eventual settlement being reached with Mr. Jackson against LVMPD and it's crime lab could reach into the '7-figure' range, implying a settlement of millions of dollars to Mr. Jackson.[76] The Las Vegas Sun reported on August 11, 2011 that a federal jury had awarded the sum of 2.1 million (reduced to 1.6 million by a federal judge) to Charles Barnard, a resident of Henderson, Nevada as a result of charges of excessive force by LVMPD Officers Gary Clark, Greg Theobald and Steven Radmanovich.[77] On September 13, 2011, LVMPD officer Peter Hervoyavich was arrested for soliciting prostitution after being observed by fellow police officers picking up the prostitute and driving with her to a parking lot and performing a sex act in his personal vehicle. Hervoyavich and the prostitute were arrested and booked at the Clark County Detention Center and Hervoyavich was placed on paid administrative leave.[78] On 12 December 2012, Stanley Gibson, an unarmed mental distressed individual was shot seven times by Officer Jesus Arevalo. Gibson's car had been immobilized by the police and the windows were up, indicating he was not an immediate threat to the officer.[79] LVMPD Officer John Norman was arrested on Feb 1, 2012 on felony charges of coercion and oppression under the color of office and misdemeanor open or gross lewdness. This was done following separate complaints from two women who Officer Norman had detained and/or arrested during which the women were made to expose their breasts, and that one of the women was groped. Officer Norman was released from the Clark County Detention Center on his own recognizance. The initial investigation of officer Norman came in late 2011, when he was apprised of the possible charges against him, and at that point refused to cooperate with investigators, and retained attorneys, one of which is former Clark County District Attorney David Roger. Assistant Sheriff Ray Flynn was quoted as saying that the investigation could take months, and that John Norman could lose his job.[80] On Feb 15, 2012, Assistant Sheriff Ray Flynn reported to the Las Vegas Review-Journal that two more women have come forward with allegations of misconduct on the part of officer John Norman, and that the new incidents of misconduct did not rise to the level of criminal behavior, but could rise to the level of 'conduct unbecoming an officer', and that there are now four internal investigations which are ongoing against Officer Norman.[81] On May 22, 2012, LVMPD officer Garrett Vandereecken, 43, turned himself in to the Clark County Detention Center at 3pm He remained in custody at 4:30pm Vandereecken was being investigated by his own department's Juvenile Sexual Abuse Detail. He was arrested on a felony charge of lewdness with a minor under 14, and is suspended without pay pending the outcome of criminal and internal affairs investigations.[82]
