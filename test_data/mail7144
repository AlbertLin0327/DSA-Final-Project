Bryan Barber ( born 1970[citation needed] ) is a music video and motion picture director. He has directed many music videos for popular artists. Barber graduated from Sacramento, CA Hiram Johnson High School in 1988[citation needed]. He graduated from Clark Atlanta University in 1996.[1] Barber has stature within the music video industry for his ability to break out of the cliches that have dogged the music video business.[citation needed] Barber's videos convey a classic mood often taken from previous era hits. Barber's ability to be heard as a clear and distinct authorial voice lay in his defining a unique visual style, a postmodern style that relied heavily on the use of classic film and TV clips.[2] For example, Barber referenced Grease in the OutKast music video Roses and the Beatles' Ed Sullivan appearance in the band's video for Hey Ya!. In the process, Barber emerged as a talent and imparted an original image to the hip-hop movement.[2] Barber made his feature film debut with Idlewild, a 1930s musical set in the fictional Georgia town of Idlewild (inspired by the Michigan resort town that served as a safe vacation haven for middle-class blacks in the pre-Civil Rights era ). The film starred OutKast (who's members include Andr 3000 & Big Boi), Paula Patton, Terrence Howard and Faizon Love. OutKast also produced Idlewild (album) an accompanying album. Barber spent "$50,000 for a presentation that included motion capture, stunts, concept art, storyboards and sound design" to try to get job directing X-Men Origins: Wolverine from 20th Century Fox. He did not get the job but Fox was impressed enough with it reimburse Barber. Barber is currently working on a adaptation of Gigantor after acquiring the rights from Fred Ladd.[3] Some of the many videos Barber has directed are:
