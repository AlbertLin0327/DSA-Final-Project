Content:
T-complex protein 1 subunit eta is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CCT7 gene.[1][2] This gene encodes a molecular chaperone that is a member of the chaperonin containing TCP1 complex (CCT), also known as the TCP1 ring complex (TRiC). This complex consists of two identical stacked rings, each containing eight different proteins. Unfolded polypeptides enter the central cavity of the complex and are folded in an ATP-dependent manner. The complex folds various proteins, including actin and tubulin. Alternate transcriptional splice variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene, but only two of them have been characterized to date.[2] CCT7 has been shown to interact with PPP4C.[3][4]
