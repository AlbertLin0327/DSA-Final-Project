Caleb Green (born October 7, 1985) is a professional basketball player, currently playing for Spirou Basket in Belgium. Previously he played for TBB Trier in Germany and Oral Roberts University in Tulsa.[1] A Tulsa native who played for Memorial High School, Green was not recruited by the major in-state programs like the University of Oklahoma or the University of Tulsa, where he had hoped to play.[2][3] Instead, Green attended Oral Roberts University, also in Tulsa, and played for four years. As a junior, he averaged 20.8 points per game and 8.8 rebounds per game, while as a senior, he averaged 20.5 points per game and 9.3 rebounds per game.[4] Even as a freshman, Green averaged more than thirty minutes a game, as he did for his entire college career.[5] Green also led Oral Roberts to the NCAA tournament in his junior and senior seasons.[6] For these accomplishments, he was named the Mid Continent Conference (now Summit League) player of the year in his sophomore, junior, and senior seasons.[7] As a senior, he was also a Wooden Award finalist.[8] In his senior season at Oral Roberts, Green led the nation in both free throws made and attempted.[9] He finished his senior season as the NCAA's active scoring leader.[10] Additionally, Green holds the Mid-Con Conference career scoring and rebounding records.[7][11] Green was not drafted by any NBA team and elected to play professionally overseas. He played one season for German club Trier averaging 17.9 points and 6.1 rebounds per game.[1] Subsequently, Green signed with Dexia in the Belgian League.[12] In his first season with Dexia, Green averaged 14.6 points and 6.2 rebounds per game while shooting 64.2 percent from the field.[13] In 2009, he signed a one-year contract extension with the club, including a club-option for the 20102011 season.[14] Since the 2009-2010 season he played for Basketball Club Oostende.
