William Russell Allen House is a historic house at 359 East Street in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. It was designed by H. Neill Wilson. It was built in 1886 and added to the National Historic Register in 1980. Built as a summer cottage for Allen, a Missouri railroad and a granite quarry owner, it is "a rare example of American Queen Anne Style architecture because of its terra cotta tile exterior, the hand-painted ceiling, the fireplaces with polished onyx marble and Casting (metalworking) bronze, and stained glass windows."[2]
