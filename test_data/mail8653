Nagakubo-shuku (, Nagakubo-shuku?) was the twenty-seventh of the sixty-nine stations of the Nakasend (an historical major road). It is located in the present-day town of Nagawa, in the Chiisagata District of Nagano Prefecture, Japan. Located between the Wada Pass and the Kasadori Pass, two difficult parts along the Nakasend, Nagakubo flourished as a post down during the Edo period. As the town developed, its row houses eventually spread to side streets, giving it the rare shape of a key. At its most prosperous time, there were over 45 inns in which travelers could rest, making it a rather large post town.[1] Coordinates: 361514N 1381603E / 36.2538N 138.2675E / 36.2538; 138.2675
