Quetschentaart, a popular Luxembourg speciality, is an open fruit tart with damson plums. Traditionally, it is a seasonal dish served in the autumn after the local plums have ripened in September. The dough for the pastry base consists of flour, yeast, milk and butter. It is kneaded and allowed to rise for half an hour. The base is then basted with egg, sprinked with sugar, placed in a baking dish and covered with halved plums (no stones) arranged in circles. It is baked at 180 C for some 45 min or until ready.[1][2]
