Wellingborough is a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. The current MP is Peter Bone of the Conservative Party, first elected at the 2005 general election. The constituency is named after the town of Wellingborough and covers most of the Borough of Wellingborough local government district. The constituency also includes the towns of Rushden and Higham Ferrers in the neighbouring local government district of East Northamptonshire. Following their review of parliamentary representation in Northamptonshire, the Boundary Commission for England has created a new constituency in the county, meaning consequential changes for the rest of the county. The modified Wellingborough constituency is formed from the following electoral wards:        Coordinates: 5218N 042W / 52.30N 0.70W / 52.30; -0.70
