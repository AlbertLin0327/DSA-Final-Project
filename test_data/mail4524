August Wilhelm Zumpt (December 4, 1815  April 22, 1877) was a German classical scholar, known chiefly in connection with Latin epigraphy. He was a nephew of Karl Gottlob Zumpt. Born in Knigsberg, Zumpt studied in Berlin, and in 1851 became professor in the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium. His papers on epigraphy (collected in Commentationes epigraphicae, i vols., 1850-54) brought him into conflict with Theodor Mommsen in connexion with the preparation of the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, a scheme for which, drawn up by Mommsen, was approved in 1847. Zumpt died in Berlin. Wilhelm Ihne incorporated materials left by him in the seventh and eighth volumes of his Rmische Geschichte (1840).
