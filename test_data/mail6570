Blue of Sint-Niklaas (Dutch:Sint-Niklase Blauwe) is a Flemish rabbit breed. It has been bred since the 19th century, near the city of Sint-Niklaas, to supply the local fur-industry, and is thereby one of the oldest fur-rabbit breeds of the world. The Van Beveren, also a fur-rabbit breed, is family and has been bred in the same region of Flanders, the Waasland. Internationally, only blue varieties are accepted by the standard, in contrary to the Van Beverens, where other varieties are accepted. Also in contrary to the Van Beverens, the weight of the Blue of Sint-Niklaas is much larger, up to 12lb (5.4kg) indicating resemblance to the Flemish Giant. After the decrease of pelt-saling and fur-industries in the region (and the world) the breed became almost extinct, as it was not popular as a pet or meat-rabbit. Only a few European breeders in Belgium and France are left.
