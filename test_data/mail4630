Successories is a producer and retailer of motivational office decorations, mostly featuring photographs paired with sentiments about motivation, teamwork, and perseverance. The word "Successories" is itself a registered trademark. Successories was founded in 1985, by Mac Anderson, as an extension of his hobby of collecting quotations and motivational writings.[1] Output initially consisted of books of quotations, award plaques, and customized gifts. Production of framed and captioned photographs, with which they have become identifiable, began soon after. The company went public in 1990. The following year, the first of a series of Successories retail stores opened, appearing in a number of malls across the United States, most of which have closed since going back to private in 2003. In 2009, Successories was purchased by TWS Partnership, LLC, an investment group controlled by brothers Ted and Warren Struhl, who moved the company from Aurora, IL to Boca Raton, FL. Successories is best known for its motivational wall art known as Corporate Impressions and Essence Of..., although they have over 18 different lines of wall art.[2] Successories has also branched out into other areas, such as awards and Desktop Motivation.[3]
