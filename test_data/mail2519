The Maxim-Tokarev was a Russian light machine gun based on the Maxim M1910. Following World War I, the Soviet army started developing a machine gun, and the 7.62mm Maxim Tokarev and Maxim Koleshnikov are examples of their initial efforts. This was an interim light machine gun modification, built along the lines of the German lMG 08/18 light machine gun. The water jacket was discarded and replaced by a thin perforated steel jacket, and the barrel was shortened and lightened. The barrel could be changed more or less quickly in the field. Spade grips were replaced with rifle-type stock and the thumb-trigger was replaced by a rifle-type trigger. A folding bipod was attached to the barrel jacket. The feed system was the same as on Maxim M1910 guns, except the standard belt capacity was reduced to 100 rounds. 100-round belts were usually carried in separate drum-type containers. More than 3,500 Maxim-Tokarev guns were produced by Tula arms factory (TOZ) in 1926-27; 3,550 were later sold to Republican Spain.
