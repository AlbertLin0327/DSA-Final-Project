 Coat of arms The Duchy of Saxe-Eisenberg was one of the Saxon Duchies held by the Ernestine line of the Wettin Dynasty. Established in 1680 for Christian, fifth son of Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha, the Duchy consisted Eisenberg and the towns of Ronneburg, Roda and Camburg. Upon the death of the childless duke in 1707, the lands were disputed between Christian's remaining brothers and their descendants in the "Coburg Eisenberg Roemhilder inherit-ridden", which only in 1735 could be resolved. Disputed between Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Rmhild, Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and Saxe-Hildburghausen
