The Nagoya Line (, Nagoya-sen?) is a railway line of a Japanese private railway company Kintetsu, connecting Nagoya and Ise Nakagawa Station in Matsusaka, Mie Prefecture via Kuwana, Yokkaichi, Suzuka, Tsu municipalities along the Ise Bay. The official origin of the line is Ise-Nakagawa and the end is Nagoya, however, operationally trains "down" from and "up" to Nagoya. The line is parallel to Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) Kansai Main Line, then Ise Railway, again JR Central Kisei Main Line, three together offer rapid service from Nagoya to Ise. At Ise-Nakagawa, the line has connections to Osaka Line to Uehommachi and Kintetsu Namba Stations of downtown Osaka, and to Yamada Line to Ujiyamada Station and beyond Toba Station on Yamada Line and Kashikojima Station of Shima Line, to provide touristic access to scenic Shima Penisnsula and Ise Shrine. Part of the line was first built and opened in 1915 onward by an independent railway operator Ise Electric Railway (, Ise Denki Testud?) with rail gauge 1.067m. After a complex history it was absorbed to Sang Kyk Electric Railway (, Sang Kyuk Dentetsu?), a predecessor of Kintetsu. After the acquisition of a connection to Osaka, it had long been forcing passengers to change trains due to the difference of gauges. In 1959 the disastrous Ise-wan Typhoon destroyed the line and Kintetsu decided to convert to 1.435m gauge (standard gauge) with the restruction, the standard of the company to enable direct operation between Osaka and Nagoya. Today a number of Limited Express trains between Osaka and Nagoya, and between Nagoya and Ise and Shima area are operated.
