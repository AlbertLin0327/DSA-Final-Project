A running survey is a rough survey made by a vessel while coasting. Bearings to landmarks are taken at intervals as the vessel sails offshore, and are used to fix features on the coast and further inland. Intervening coastal detail is sketched in.[1] The method was used by James Cook,[2][3][4] and subsequently by navigators who sailed underor were influenced byhim, including George Vancouver[5], William Bligh and Matthew Flinders.[6]
