A manciple (play/mnspl/) is a person in charge of the purchase and storage of food at an institution such as a college, monastery, or court of law. Manciples were sometimes also in charge of catering more generally, including food preparation. The title still survives in some Oxford and Cambridge colleges, at the Charterhouse in the City of London, and in the name of Manciple Street in the borough of Southwark, London SE1. The term comes from Middle English "maunciple", taken from Old French, which in turn comes from the Latin "mancipium", "manceps", a purchaser of stores.
