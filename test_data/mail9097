The Khlung is a forested ridge, up to 129.8mabovesea level, in the north German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The name may be derived from the word Kuhlen (referring to the extensive fissuring of this region). The Khlung lies in the district of Rostock, southeast of the Bay of Mecklenburg and south of the Baltic Sea coast. This protected area is located immediately south of Khlungsborn and a little west of Bad Doberan. The Khlung is part of the Baltic Uplands that run from Ostholstein along the coast. The ridge runs from northwest to southeast and is around eleven kilometres long and two to three kilometres wide. Large parts, especially around the crest of the ridge, are forested, the contiguous strip of woods being between 500metres and one kilometre wide and covering a total area of 6,300hectares. On the 78.8 m high Bastorfer Signalberg  the western end of the ridge by the Baltic Sea  stands the Bastorf Lighthouse which is visible for miles. The individually named hills in the Khlung include: Coordinates: 54636N 114638E / 54.11N 11.77722E / 54.11; 11.77722
