Acton Bridge railway station is near the village of Acton Bridge, Cheshire, in the northwest of England. The station, and all the trains that stop here, are operated by London Midland; however, very few services call at this station on the service between Liverpool and Birmingham. Acton Bridge still does not have any trains on a Sunday which call, but many trains pass through on the West Coast Main Line towards both Liverpool and Preston. A near normal service operates on most bank holidays however. The next station along the line towards Preston is Warrington Bank Quay, but there are no direct services between the two (the other case of this is Berwick-upon-Tweed and Chathill). 2,709 passengers are recorded as using the station in 2004-5.[1] The station gardens are maintained by volunteers from Acton Bridge Women's Institute, and won a Commendation in the 2003 JPD 'Best Kept Station' competition. The station opened as Acton by the Grand Junction Railway but was renamed Acton Bridge in 1870. After merging into the London and North Western Railway, the company became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The line then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When sectorisation was introduced, the station was served by Regional Railways until the privatisation of British Railways. Trains of the Intercity Sector passed on the West Coast Main Line.
