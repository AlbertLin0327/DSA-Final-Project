"Test Drive" is a song by Japanese singer and former KAT-TUN member Jin Akanishi, serving as his debut single in the United States. The track which features American singer Jason Derlo was released digitially to the American market November 8, 2011.[1] It was released a month later in Japan as an album. The "Test Drive" digital EP reached the top of the iTunes Store's dance album chart shortly after its release, and was also climbing the general albums chart at that same time.[2] The single was later released in Japan on December 7, 2011. As a single, it has reached number 14 on the Japan Hot 100 chart, while debuting at number 1 on the Billboard Japan album charts. It has also debuted on the Oricon's weekly album charts at number 1, selling nearly 109,000 copies in its first week of release. It was the best performance by a Japanese artist's foreign album release since Hikaru Utada released Exodus in 2004.[3]
