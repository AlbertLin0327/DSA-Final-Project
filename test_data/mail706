Coordinates: 505812N 05020W / 50.97006N 0.83902W / 50.97006; -0.83902 Elsted is a village in the Chichester district of West Sussex, England. It lies within the civil parish of Elsted and Treyford. The village is on the Midhurst to South Harting Road 4.5miles (7.2km) west of Midhurst. The small Anglican parish church north of the crossroads, St. Pauls, has a nave which had become derelict, leaving the chancel as the village church, until it was rebuilt in the 1950s. The surviving north wall is of Norman style herringbone stonework, with two round arched doorways filled in to make lancet windows. The village has one public house, and there is another at the former Elsted railway station at Elsted Marsh east of the village.
