The Young India Fellowship (YIF) , started in 2011 in collaboration with University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), is a one-year residential, multi-disciplinary post-graduate programme based on the liberal arts. The fellowship is offered completely free of cost to 50 individuals from around the country and across a breadth of academic disciplines. The average cost of the programme per Fellow is INR 8 lakhs and each fellow has a sponsor committed to the programme. Fellows undertake a total of 26 courses during the one year (full time residential) programme which is located in New Delhi. The International Foundation for Research and Education (IFRE) - a non-profit organization and the School of Engineering and Allied Sciences, University of Pennsylvania, have collaborated in the design and delivery of the Young India Fellowship Programme. The fellowship is being referred to as Indias own Rhodes Scholarship. [1] [2][3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8][9] The seeds of the Young India Fellowship germinated in a simple conversation between friends. While on the one end Sanjeev Bhikchandani, Founder, Naukri.com and Ashish Dhawan, Co-founder of ChrysCapital Investment Advisors, were thinking about starting a Liberal Arts school, on the other end Vineet Gupta, Managing Director at Jamboree Education and Director at Parabolic Drugs and Rakesh Jaggi, VP at Reservoir Production Group, Schlumberger were talking about setting up a high quality technology institute. They were also talking to Pramath R. Sinha, Founding Dean of Indian School of Business (ISB), who mooted the idea of bringing the two concepts together in a multidisciplinary university. They concluded that in all this time enough technology and business institutes focused on producing professionals had cropped up, but liberal and general education had been neglected. Over time the circle of friends who believed in the idea grew to include Ashok Belani, CTO Schlumberger; Arjun Bhagat, Chairman of Calibrated Group; Pranav Gupta, Managing Director at Parabolic Drugs; Vinati Kastia, Partner AZB & Partners; Ashish Gupta, COO at Evalueserve; Sunish Sharma, Managing Director, General Atlantic; Saurabh Srivastava, Angel Investor, Venture Capitalist and Entrepreneur and N.V. Tiger Tyagarajan, President and CEO, Genpact. [4] The "Young India Fellowship seeks to groom young women and men who can lead India through the 21st century. The YIF has been specially conceived and designed to create the countrys finest, most socially conscious leaders. A prospective Fellow should be someone with dimensions to his or her personality, and not just someone who has been brilliant only in the area of academics. They should be someone who has the capacity to integrate diverse interests and learning to be best at whatever he or she may want to do in life, and to become a change agent. [3] [10] [4] [6] [7] [11] Leading undergraduate programmes in India seem to focus too early on professional and specialized courses that tend to stifle the abilities of talented young minds to explore different perspectives and avenues. YIF is designed to rekindle the desire to learn and explore. The perceived value of a broad-based liberal arts education at the undergraduate level has declined over the years. This has compromised a well-rounded learning experience at the higher education level in India. YIF wants to bring liberal arts to the centre-stage of a more holistic learning experience. The Young India Fellowship (YIF), in conjunction with the University of Pennsylvania,[4][5] is the first academic programme in the country to fill the void in higher education for a holistic, multi-disciplinary course based on the liberal arts. Each years batch of 50 Fellows will take subjects including Analytical Thinking, Leadership, Writing and Listening Skills, Philosophy, Sociology, Psychology, History, Economics and Statistics as well as classes designed to bring out their creativity, such as Art Appreciation and Latin Dancing. They will undertake a unique experiential learning internship, and gain practical work experience through a real-life project. Fellows will be taught by faculties from respected universities both in India and abroad, and will be mentored by some of Indias best known leaders such as Andre Bteille (Renowned Sociologist and Writer), N. R. Narayana Murthy (Founder, Infosys) and Deepak Parekh (Chairman, HDFC). [10] [12] [4] [6] [7] [11] Tushar Chugh, Jatin Sharma and Rolly Seth - a team of three Young India Fellows have developed a haptic belt that senses obstructions and helps the visually impaired walk freely. The belt, called as viSparsh [loose combination of vision and sparsh(touch)], can assist people with visual impairment in their daily activities. Fellows developed this low-cost distance sensor in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania. It has an infrared optic sensor that projects thousands of dots in a three to 12 feet distance to determine obstacles present. Based on the proximity and relative direction of the obstacles to the wearer, a series of vibrators on the belt alert the wearer of their presence and provides a 160 degree view of the environment. It is lightweight, low-cost (~Rs 5,000), easy to use, non-conspicuous and hands and ear-free. The belt will be wearable, affordable and practical for a visually impaired person.[13] [14] Like the students, the YIFs faculty is also from a diverse set of backgrounds, from business to academia, film-making and media, sociology and anthropology to statistics and economics. Some of the faculty and mentors at the YIF include: [10] [12] [4] [6]  N. R. Narayana Murthy - Founder, Infosys  Deepak Parekh - Chairman, HDFC  Andre Bteille - Professor of Sociology, Delhi School of Economics, University of Delhi  Dr Kaushik Basu - Chief Economic Adviser, Ministry of Finance (India)  Sanjeev Chatterjee - Vice Dean, Professor and Executive Director at the Knight Center for International Media, University of Miami[15]  Dr Kenneth Foster - Professor, Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania [16]  Radha S. Hegde - Associate Professor, Department of Media, Culture and Communication, New York University [17]  Dr Rudrangshu Mukherjee - historian and author, as well as Opinions Editor, The Daily Telegraph, Kolkata  Subir Sinha - Senior Lecturer, Department of Development Studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London[18]
