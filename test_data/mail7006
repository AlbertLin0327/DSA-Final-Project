High School Musical: O Desafio (English: The Challenge) is a spin-off of the American film High School Musical for the Brazilian market, based on the book Battle of the Bands. It began filming in April 2009 and it is the third Disney-branded feature film made in Latin America. However, the Brazilian version does not follow the caricatural style seen in the Argentinian and Mexican productions. The movie has a script created specifically for the cinema and an original plotline. It is a remake of High School Musical with the Brazilian versions of characters Troy, Gabriella, Ryan, Sharpay, Chad, Taylor and Kelsie. It was filmed in Rio de Janeiro and Olodum, the cultural group from Bahia, was invited to bring its unique rhythm to a special choreography number. The roles in the movie are played by the winners and finalists of the Brazilian TV program High School Musical: A Seleo: Olavo, Renata, Fellipe, Paula, Moroni, Beatriz, Samuel and Karol. It also has the special participation of Wanessa Camargo. A new school year begins at the High School Brasil (HSB), and the students return from the summer vacations. Olavo, the captain of the school futsal team, the Lobos-Guar, discovers that Renata, his neighbor and classmate, has changed a lot over the summer. Paula, however, continues being vain and wastes her time dominating her poor brother, Fellipe, and her associates Alcia, Clara and Karol, or, as she prefers to call them, "The Invisibles". The principal of the school and Ms. Mrcia, the art teacher, invite the students to take part in the school's first battle of the bands, where the kids will have a chance to be showcased as true music stars. Wanessa, a former student and now a famous singer, comes to the school as adviser to the contest. Working against the clock and with limited resources, the kids put all the forces for the big day. Olavo and Renata, together with their friends Moroni, Bia, Samuel, Fbio and Ed, as well as Fellipe, participate in the contest, forming a band named The Tribe. At the same time, Paula participates with her friends, and she tries the impossible task of separating Fellipe from his new friends. But only one band will be the winner, the one which can understand that teamwork, personal development, and study will make them better artists and also better people. There are songs in the film that weren't included in the official soundtrack above. The Concert
