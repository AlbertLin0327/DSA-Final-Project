The Journal of Mammalogy is the flagship publication of the American Society of Mammalogists. Both the society and the journal were founded in 1919. The peer-reviewed journal publishes papers about mammals throughout the world and their conservation. Papers may be on all aspects of the biology of mammals, including ecology, genetics, conservation, behavior, systematics, morphology and physiology. The journal also publishes news about the American Society of Mammalogists and advertises student scholarship opportunities.
