See text Duvaua Kunth[1] Schinus is a genus of flowering trees and tall shrubs in the sumac family, Anacardiaceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as pepper trees. The Peruvian Pepper Tree (Schinus molle)[3] is the source of the spice known as pink peppercorns[4] but can become serious invasive species outside their natural habitats. Schinus polygama, although less well known, is also potentially weedy in some areas. The generic name is derived from the Greek word for Pistacia lentiscus,  (schinos), which it resembles.[5] Over time there has been a fair amount of reclassification within this genus and earlier names may incorrectly continue to be used by those unaware of changes, including in some cases government departments and even textbooks. The name Schinus areira remains widespread, in Australia (the Peppercorn tree) in particular, but is now considered to be a sub-species of Schinus molle (var. areira).
