"Diamond" Carlo Citrone (born Carlos Citrone) is a British professional poker player and commentator, based in Newcastle upon Tyne. Citrone was raised in Whitley Bay by his father John Citrone, a fifteen-time world bodybuilding champion and supplier of sports nutrition and gym equipment products. Whilst still a teenager, Citrone was given a gym from his father in North Shields to run with his father's partner Sunderland A.F.C. footballer Dave Buchanan, on expanding the business they bought a health club in Redcar. The health club went on to become part of a successful chain and was sold, leaving Carlo (who was suffering from insomnia) in need of a new challenge. He found this in poker and began playing tournaments at the Stanley Casino in Newcastle. He began playing in 2001 and has won tournaments in Walsall, Melbourne, Luton and London, where he won the 500 no limit hold'em event of the 2003 British Open, defeating Lucy Rokach in the heads-up confrontation. His major tournament money finishes include two World Series of Poker (WSOP) final tables and 2nd place in the 500 no limit hold'em event at the 2002 European Poker Championships. Citrone also appeared in the Late Night Poker television series (series 5, episode 7) where he finished 3rd, behind Dave Colclough and Charalambos "Bambos" Xanthos. In 2004, Citrone was sentenced to two years in prison for being knowingly concerned with the smuggling of 2,700,000 cigarettes. Citrone denied his involvement, indicating that the person responsible was a fellow poker player. Citrone however, refused to go on record and implicate the poker player in question who was a father and a friend. Citrone eventually served approximately twelve months for the offence and was ordered to pay some 370,000 as part of a Confiscation Order ordered in favour of the Crown. On 12 July 2005, Citrone was adjudged bankrupt, with unsecure debts in excess of 700,000. He also appeared in the 2005 World Speed Poker Open, finishing 4th in his heat. Citrone is known for taking his time over decisions and entered the speed poker event for the extra challenge. Citrone is also a regular commentator on The Poker Channel, alongside Gary Jones. He has worked as an analyst on Sky Vegas Poker (channel 865) As of 2008 his total live tournament winnings exceed $680,000. He has one daughter, Angelina, born in December 2004.
