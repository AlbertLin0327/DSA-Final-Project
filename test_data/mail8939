Roseanne Barr "Three Hundred Big Boys" is the sixteenth episode of season four of Futurama, which aired June 15, 2003. Zapp Brannigan leads an attack on Tarantulon VI, claiming silken artworks. Earth President Richard Nixon gives the riches to the citizens of Earth as a $300 tax rebate. Leela plans to swim with a whale, while Fry decides to drink 100 cups of coffee. Dr. Zoidberg sets off to live like a rich man. Scruffy the Janitor decides to get an expensive haircut. Bender ponders buying one $300 hookerbot or 300 $1 hookerbots. Brannigan calls up Leela, and invites the staff to a display of the silk treasures. Kif rents a paddle plane, and he and Amy go for a flight. Amy purchases a talking tattoo that repeatedly insults and mocks Kif, to her irritation. Professor Farnsworth buys one pound of stem cells and smears them on his face, causing a temporary anti-aging effect. Bender spies a $10,000 cigar at a tobacco shop. Unable to afford it, he buys a $300 set of burglar's tools at the same shop. Hermes spends $299.99 on a pair of boots that turn into bamboo stilts for his son Dwight, allowing Dwight to invest the remaining cent. When Dwight rejects the gift, Hermes puts the boots on; they malfunction, and Hermes becomes an out-of-control menace, with Dwight hanging on. Professor Farnsworth, now looking younger, meets a 20-year-old woman. Leela purchases a ticket to swim with a whale named Mushu. As Kif and Amy continue their flight, Kif gives her a watch that tells the time where both of them are. They fly over the aquarium and when Amy waves to Leela and Fry, the watch falls and Mushu swallows it. That night, Bender uses his burglar's tools to steal the Grand Cigar, unaware that he is videotaped. Zoidberg remembers how he ate another watch Kif had given Amy and that the solution was to induce vomiting. Scruffy devises a plan to make the whale throw up: Leela will feed rotten fish from Elzar's to Mushu when she goes for her swim, which will cause him to vomit. The next day, Bender tells an over-caffeinated Fry that he does not want to light his stolen cigar until he is at Zapp Brannigan's party and can blow smoke into the faces of the "fancy-pantses" there; he reasons that the cigar is too good for its smoke to be wasted on regular people. Leela arrives at the aquarium with her swimsuit stuffed with rotten fish, and Mushu eats both the fish and the suit. Later, Mushu vomits up the watch. Kif recovers it, but is imprisoned for stealing aquarium property. At Commander Riker's Island, the Whale Biologist tells Kif that he will drop the charges if he returns the property. When Kif thought it was the watch he dropped, the Whale Biologist states that he was talking about the ambergris he's covered in having to use the Hologram of Roseanne Barr to explain what ambergis is in "The Guide to the World of Facts." Kif just sheds his skin in order to return the ambergris to the Whale Biologist. At the silk gala, Bender lights the cigar and blows smoke into the faces of everybody there. As Professor Farnsworth makes out with his girlfriend, his stem cells reject his body and crawl off. After Farnsworth confesses his age, his girlfriend admits that she also used her tax refund to make herself look more attractive. She pulls a ring from her navel and her volume increases by several times (i.e., she seems to get fatter). Putting aside their physical problems, they confess their love for each other. Hermes crashes through a window, still on the stilts. They hit Bender's cigar, sending it flying into a tapestry. As flames spread through the room, an agitated Fry drinks his hundredth cup of coffee. Fry enters a caffeine-induced state of hyperspeed where he perceives everything else as moving so slowly that it appears to be standing still. He rescues everyone at incredible speed (which for him is a leisurely pace). The rescued partiers find themselves in an alley behind the gallery where Fry left them, confused but unharmed. They find Zoidberg, who, unable to make himself feel rich, has bought a meal for a group of hobos. Everybody joins in; the silk surplus has been destroyed; and Bender joyfully gets closure to his story by being beaten by the police. During the credits, the Hologram of Roseanne Barr gives more facts from "The Guide to the World of Facts." In its initial airing, the episode received a Nielsen rating of 3.6/7, placing it 79th among primetime shows for the week of June 9-15, 2003. [1]
