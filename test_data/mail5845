The following is the list of Belgian Ambassadors to the Holy See, past and present. A Belgian Ambassador serves as that country's official representative to the Holy See since formal diplomatic relations began in 1832. Between 1880 and 1885 there were no diplomatic relations between Belgium and the Holy See.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
