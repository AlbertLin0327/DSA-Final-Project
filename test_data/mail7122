He graduated from Scott's Branch High school in Summerton, South Carolina. After high school he enlisted in U.S. Air Force, served three years until 1968 and later entered Morgan State University,where he earned a B.S. in business administration in 1975. During his stint on the Baltimore City Council, Stukes made national news by introducing a resolution that would ban the word nigger.[3] Stukes said he was prompted to introduce the measure, not because of racism, but because it was being used widely by members of his own race.[4] Stukes said that by ignoring the use of the word, officials give the impression, especially to young people, that it's acceptable.
