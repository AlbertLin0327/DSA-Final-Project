Content:
Thematic images are usually image products of classification processing of multispectral images of the earth surface. The classification process differentiates types of surface such as land, water, forest, lake, structure etc. In more details we might have classes such as type of crop, or pollution structure, burn forest, volcano eruption with lava, clear or turbid water, seawater, phytoplankton, or, in smaller scales, roads, crops, artificial structures etc.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
