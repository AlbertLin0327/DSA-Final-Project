The Klejnrka is a river which flows through the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It is a 40.3-kilometre (25.0mi) left tributary of the Labe. The Klejnrka originates in the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands about 5 kilometres (3.1mi) southwest of Zbov, near the village of Dobrovtov. It flows northward through the towns of slav and Nov Dvory (where it is joined by its largest tributary, the Vrchlice). From here it flows another 6 kilometres (3.7mi) northward to join the Labe river in Star Koln. Coordinates: 5001N 1516E / 50.017N 15.267E / 50.017; 15.267
