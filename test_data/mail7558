Perry Meridian High School is a high school located at 400 W. Meridian School Road in Indianapolis, Indiana, 46217, on the far southside of the city. It is one of two public high schools serving grades nine through twelve in the Perry Township, along with Southport High School. Enrollment count, submitted to the Indiana Department of Education for the 2009-10 school year, was 2,250.[3] Perry Meridian High School is part of the Metropolitan School District of Perry Township.[4] The school colors are Navy Blue, Carolina Blue and Silver. The school mascot is the Falcon. Perry Meridian opened its doors in the fall of 1973 under principal James Head. Students and teachers came from Southport High School, which previously was the only high school in Perry Township. Perry Meridian only enrolled grades 9-11 during its first year. Southport students picked the school colors and mascot for Perry during the 1972-73 school year.[citation needed] In March 2008, an English teacher (a 27-year veteran) at the high school was suspended without pay for using the book The Freedom Writers Diary in her classroom when "the school board contend[ed] she didn't follow the rules for getting permission to use it." In April 2008, the board voted to let this suspension run until the end of the semester in 2009.[5] Coordinates: 393852N 860958W / 39.64778N 86.16611W / 39.64778; -86.16611
