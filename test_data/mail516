The 1975 Hamilton Tiger-Cats season was the 18th season for the team in the Canadian Football League and their 26th overall. The Tiger-Cats finished in 3rd place in the East division with a 5101 record, but lost the East Semi-Finals to the Montreal Alouettes. Tiger-Cats president Ralph Sazio became president of the Canadian Football League in 1975.[1] It would be Garney Henleys last season with the Tiger-Cats where he finished his career finished with 56 touchdowns. At the time, it was the franchise record for most touchdowns in a Tiger-Cats career.[2] Long-time CFL star Jerry Keeling would join the Tiger-Cats midway through the season, as it would also be his final season in the CFL.[3] Terry Evanshen set a Tiger-Cats record (since broken) for most touchdowns in one season by a Tiger-Cats player with 13.[2] On September 7, Evanshen scored four of those touchdowns in one game against the Ottawa Rough Riders. He tied Garney Henleys record for most touchdowns in one game by a Tiger-Cats player. In the same game, Evanshen would set a franchise record with most points in one game by scoring 26 points.[2] Tragedy struck the CFL in October, when 23-year old, Hamilton Tiger-Cats star Tom Pate suffered an aneurysm in the fourth quarter against the Stampeders at McMahon Stadium. Pate was not able to regain consciousness and eventually died two days later. A year later, the CFLPA announced the Tom Pate Memorial Award in his honour to be awarded to the player who best personifies a unique combination of outstanding sportsmanship and dedication to the league and the community.
