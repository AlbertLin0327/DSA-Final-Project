"The Anatomy of Desire" is a short story by John L'Heureux, first published in L'Heureux's book, Desires, in 1981. It can also be read in American Gothic Tales edited by Joyce Carol Oates and Sudden Fiction edited by Richard Shapard. It is the story of a man with an unwavering need for more than just love: he wants to possess and be possessed. Determined to do so, he goes to an extreme only to learn there can only be desire: "He walked around on his skinned feet, leaving bloody footprints up and down the corridors, looking for someone to love him."[1] The story of Hanley is told in third-person narrative. An event which forever changes his life is explained in detail. Hanley was the unfortunate soldier that had been caught by the enemy while sleeping. The general was very fond of Hanley when he was brought to him. He felt that Hanley could be his own son, but nevertheless, he still had to perform his duty. In the morning it was time for Hanley to be punished. He would serve as an example of what happened to infiltrators. The enemy proceeded in flaying Hanley's skin, sparing his face and gentitals as the general had requested. His skin was then hung on the barbed wire and he was left for dead. When morning arrived, the enemy had retreated and Hanley was rescued and then sent to the veteran 's hospital. This was a lonely time for Hanley. No one wanted to be near him, except if they were obligated, because of his condition. Here Hanley met the nurse called the saint. She was a loving woman who when asked by Hanley if she would love him, agreed. Hanley eventually revealed he did not just want her to love him, he wanted to be possessed by her. The saint would tell Hanley how handsome he was, how much she needed him, and how she could not live without him. This went on for quite some time, but it was not enough for Hanley. "I am in love and I am loved, Why isn't this enough?" [1] Hanley wanted to be surrounded by the saint; to be enclosed by her. That night they made love, but it still was not enough for Hanley. During this time, Hanley was receiving letters from the general. He felt remorse for what he did to Hanley, but still explained he had to do his duty. In the final letter, the general revealed he could no longer endure it and that he was possessed by Hanley. One day Hanley finally realized what he wanted and told the saint that he wanted her skin. The saint allowed him to do so only slightly shivering from the cold blade of the knife. Surprisingly, the saint felt satisfied about it. He spared her face and genitals as were his. After a week went by and the skin had dried, Hanley put on the skin. He walked the corridors and left no bloody trails. "Thank you" he told the saint, "It is my heart's desire fulfilled. I am inside you. I am possessed by you." [1] When he looked into the saint's loving eyes, he finally realized what had occurred. He could never truly be possessed, he could only desire the feeling. "He plucked at his empty skin, and wept." [1] Hanley suffers from loneliness. Because of his condition, it was hard for people to be around him. When he finally did find someone to love him, he lost control. Hanley wanted more love even as he was given more. It became like an unquenchable thirst. For Hanley to realize he had reached the point where he could receive no more love, he had already taken advantage of the one that loved him. He was so consumed by the need to be loved, he left the saint vulnerable as he already was. Hanley could always desire this love, but he could never truly possess it. To realize this, he had to hurt the one who loved him. Loneliness is the root of Hanley's aspiration for love. No one was willing to be with Hanley because he was so different, not even his wife or kids. This took a mental toll on him: "Evidence has been growing that when our need for social relationships is not met, we fall apart mentally and even physically."[2] Hanley was physically unstable so one glimpse of feeling needed left him ecstatic and wanting more. Towards the end, Hanley realizes he will always be lonely because he can never truly be possessed as he wishes. Domestic abjection can also be seen in this story. This abjection can be explained in Alan Lloyd-Smith's book, American Gothic Fiction: "And yet, from its place of banishment, the abject does not cease challenging its master."[3] Hanley is aware that he should feel happy with the love he is given, but he constantly wants more. This need keeps challenging Hanley. The true abjection is apparent at the very end. Hanley was upset over what he did to the saint. He was now capable of inflicting harm onto others to achieve his needs. This need consumed their love. Their once familiar relationship was now one of heartbreak. Not only did he hurt the saint, but his now familiar world of wanting possession was over. He was left with just a void and longing. The overall message is that we cannot always achieve what we wish, they must remain desires. Turning these desires into possessions often cannot be reached or require crossing a line.
