Michael Capllonch Rotger (Pollena, 14 January 1861 - 21 December 1935) was a Majorcan pianist and composer. He studied music in Pollena with his cousin, Joan Rotger, organist of the parish of Pollena. He continued his musical studies with William Massot and at the Conservatory of Music in Madrid, with teachers like Trag, Galiana, Chap and Hernando. He then worked in Madrid with the Polish composer Weber. He obtained a grant from the Island's Council to complete studies in Germany, where he was a student at the Conservatory of Music in Berlin. Among his teachers there was Anton Rubinstein who would become a good friend. He taught music for the royal families of Prussia (the Hohenzollerns ) and Saxony, and gave concerts for European royalty. In 1906 he married Gabriela Miteau with whom he had four children. In 1912 he moved with his family to Madrid, and three years later to Barcelona. He died in Pollena on 21 December 1935 and is commemorated by a bronze bust (at 395428N 30455E / 39.90772N 3.08181E / 39.90772; 3.08181) in the main square of Port de Pollena, Placa de Miquel Capllonch, which is named after him.
