The 1960 Los Angeles Rams season was the team's 23rd year with the National Football League and the 15th season in Los Angeles. Under first-year head coach Bob Waterfield, the team won four and lost seven that year, with one game ending in a tie, placing the Rams in sixth place in the Western Conference, ahead of only the expansion Dallas Cowboys.
