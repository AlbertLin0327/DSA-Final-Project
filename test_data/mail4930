"The Galaxy Express 999" (999, Ginga Tetsud Sur Nain?) is the 11th single by Japanese rock band Godiego. The song was used as the theme song for the 1979 film adaptation of the manga of the same name. The song was composed by Godiego vocalist Yukihide Takekawa and arranged by Godiego keyboardist Mickie Yoshino. Like many Godiego songs, it is both in Japanese and English; the English lyrics were written by Yko Narahashi and the Japanese lyrics were written by Keisuke Yamakawa. The song reached #2 on the Oricon charts and was the #1 song on The Best Ten for seven weeks. To differentiate it from the theme song of the anime which has the same name in Japanese, it is often referred to by its English title which is stylized as "THE GALAXY EXPRESS 999". Several groups and artists have covered the song since its release in 1979. It was included on Animetal's Animetal Marathon VI, Masaaki Endoh's Enson2, and by Exile with Verbal of M-Flo on Exile Catchy Best in 2008. The Exile cover was digitally commercially successful, being certified by the RIAJ as being downloaded more than one million times as a ringtone,[1] and more than 500,000 times as a full-length cellphone download.[2]
