PR urban primary 142.svg Puerto Rico Highways Puerto Rico Highway 142, or PR-142, connects the north area of Puerto Rico to City of Corozal from PR-2 to PR-159. It traverses the municipalities of Dorado, Toa Alta and Corozal, with a length of about 5 miles (8.2 kilometers). In 2012 was appointed officially as Jos Antonio "Sonny" Rodriguez Ortiz Highway. In Dorado is a divided highway with two lanes in both directions. Then it becomes a smaller road with areas where there are two lanes in one direction and one lane in the other direction. Among Toa Alta and Corozal the road can be dangerous on rainy days because it forms a dense fog that can cause poor visibility to drivers. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
