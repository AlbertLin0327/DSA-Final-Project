Chrysopa perla, the 'Green Lacewing ', is a species belonging to the family Chrysopidae subfamily Chrysopinae. This widespread species is present in most of Europe. The adults reach 1012 millimetres (0.390.47 in) of length, with a wingspan of 2530 millimetres (0.981.2 in) and are fearsome predators, primarily feeding on aphids, occasionally on flower nectar. They can be encountered from May through August in cool and shady areas, mainly in deciduous woods, woodland edges and shrubs. The basic coloration of the body is green. Wings are blue-green with black veins. Several black markings are present on the head, the thorax and below the abdomen. The females usually lay eggs near aphid colonies. Also larvae are predators, mainly feeding on Aphididae and Coccidae species. The adult insects hibernate in winter.
