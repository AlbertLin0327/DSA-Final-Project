James "Jay" Mitchell (n Brown) is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Jamie Borthwick. He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 14 December 2006. Jay is the son of Karen Brown and Jase Dyer (Stephen Lord), and grandson of Bert Atkinson (Dave Hill) and Evie Brown (Marji Campi). Karen died in 2004 of breast cancer. Jay was first mentioned on 5 December 2006, when a dying Evie told Bert that he had a grandson. Jay first appears after Evie's funeral, when he is taken to live with Bert in Walford, per Evie's wishes. Jay is troublesome: He steals, breaks into Pauline Fowler's (Wendy Richard) house, and offends Yolande Trueman (Angela Wynter) with a racist slur to impress his peers. When Jay's father Jase arrives, Bert leaves to allow Jay and Jase to bond. Jay continues getting into trouble, becoming involved with a gang of older boys, known as the E20 crew, led by Tegs Teague (Ben Smith). Jay helps them shoplift, and they give him a knife. The gang terrorises Dot Branning (June Brown) and Jay steals her keys so they can break into her house. The gang orders Jay to throw a brick through Dot's window, but realising it is wrong, Jay refuses and is rejected from the gang. Tegs later confronts Jay and a fight ensues, with Jay being stabbed in the leg. Tegs is arrested and his mother Tina (Kerry Ann White) tries to threaten Jay from testifying against her son at his trial. However, she is scared off by Jase's girlfriend Dawn (Kara Tointon). Jay gives evidence at the trial and Tegs is sentenced to two years in a Young Offenders Institute. Jay and Jase try to flee Walford when Jase doublecrosses a football firm but Dawn stops their departure by setting a date for her and Jase's wedding. The firm, led by Terry Bates (Nicholas Ball), holds Jay hostage to get revenge on Jase. Jase is able to save Jay with Billy Mitchell's (Perry Fenwick) help but is beaten to death by Terry's men, and Billy, too frightened to intervene, leaves Jase to die. Jay accuses Dawn of causing his father's death and goes into care to get away from her. Jay is later fostered by Billy, who is wracked with guilt for not saving Jase from the gang. Jay's behaviour worsens when he plans an arson attack on Dawn, but Billy is able to stop him and Jay eventually makes amends with Dawn. Jay and Billy move into a flat with Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), who tries to get rid of Jay by stealing and blaming it on him. Feeling unwanted, Jay befriends Marissa Moore (Finn Atkins), who works at a brothel, and they plan to run away together. When Marissa backs out, Jay runs away alone and sleeps rough, until Billy convinces him to move back in. Terry's trial for Jase's murder approaches and Jay is furious to learn that, rather than attempting to help Jase, Billy hid to save himself. Terry's wife, Viv Bates (Dido Miles), threatens to hurt Jay if Billy testifies. Jay is taken hostage by Terry's firm as a security measure, and Billy risks his own life to save him. Billy and Jay are both rescued by the police and Billy testifies, which results in Terry receiving life imprisonment for murder, partially redeeming himself in the eyes of Jay. Billy and Jay move in with Billy's relative Phil Mitchell's (Steve McFadden). Phil gives Jay a job as a mechanic and they bond. Phil is proud of Jay when he overpowers Connor Stanley (Arinze Kene), a man who sells stolen goods for Phil. In doing so, Jay stops Connor stealing Phil's profits. Impressed with Jay's courage, Phil is pleased when Jay decides to change his surname to Mitchell, though it upsets Phil's son Ben (Joshua Pascoe). Despite initial animosity between Ben and Jay, they grow fond of each other, referring to themselves as 'brothers'. Jay starts dating Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) despite objections from her father Max (Jake Wood), who thinks Jay is only interested in sex. Jay and Abi do plan to have sex several times, but on each occasion, they are unable to go through with it. Despite Abi's insecurities over Jay's friendship with Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold), she and Jay remain together, and eventually Max comes to accept them as a couple. In 2012, Phil is imprisoned for the murder of his ex-partner Stella Crawford (Sophie Thompson), who abused Ben then jumped from a building in 2007 after Phil confronted her. It transpires that Ben is behind Phil's arrest, having given a false testimony to the police to punish his father for rejecting him for being gay. Ben admits giving false testimony to his brother, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), but Heather Trott (Cheryl Ferguson) overhears. Although it is Ian who tells the police about Ben's lie, Ben assumes it is Heather; he confronts her and in a rage, kills her. Jay witnesses the murder and is persuaded by Phil, who has just been released from prison, to cover-up Ben's involvement. Jay is traumatised by the murder and incensed to discover Ben has kept evidence to frame him for Heather's murder, should he need to. When Heather's finac Andrew Cotton (Ricky Grover) is falsely charged with Heather's murder, Jay is unable to see him sent to prison and tells the police Andrew is innocent, saying he saw him elsewhere at the time of Heather's murder; Andrew is released without charge. With Phil and Ben frequently fighting in the wake of the cover-up, Jay decides he cannot remain living with them and moves in with Abi's family. Originally a recurring character, Jay was considered a regular from July 2007.[2] He was involved in a minor racism storyline, where he called another character a "black cow". EastEnders' executive producer Diederick Santer said this was inspired by the race row in Channel 4's reality show, Celebrity Big Brother, commenting: "The Celebrity Big Brother race row kicked off as I took charge of my first scripts. I thought it was fascinating because it showed there was a real need for a debate about race in Britain. [Big Brother] didn't do it particularly well, so I thought it could be something EastEnders should do. Our stuff won't be overly moralistic or preachy but it will tackle this serious issue head on."[3] Another controversial storyline saw Jay get involved with a gang of youths, ending with him being stabbed in the thigh. A BBC spokesperson said "This is easily one of the most shocking and controversial storylines EastEnders has ever done. It is not a decision bosses have taken lightly, but it is an issue that is top of the news agenda. [...] We're going to tread very carefully  it won't be gratuitous. The plan is to screen the episodes in the usual slots before the watershed. Hopefully by showing the suffering that gang violence can cause, some people may think twice about getting involved."[4]  In January 2008, the BBC received 184 complaints from viewers over 13-year-old Jay's stabbing storyline, angry that children would have seen it. Ofcom received a further seven complaints. The BBC allowed the controversial broadcast despite a clampdown on soap violence being ordered. John Beyer of Mediawatch UK said: "I think this shows that at a flagship programme such as EastEnders they are prepared to ignore public opinion, prepared to ignore the regulator and the complaints and carry on regardless."[5] A BBC spokesperson defended the storyline, stating: "EastEnders has always tackled difficult issues and we acknowledge that some viewers could consider this storyline challenging. However, we aim to reflect real issues and during this storyline the audience will see Jay's torment through to him deciding not to yield to peer pressure like his father did many years ago. This is part of a long-running storyline that in no way glamorises the use of knives, or portrays violence in a positive light. In fact the storyline will culminate in the character of Jay doing the right thing."[6] Borthwick has been praised by critics for his portrayal of Jay. Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian wrote that the episode in which his father died "offered Jason's young son, Jay (Jamie Borthwick), a chance to steal the show, which he duly did with a touching torrent of grief. His father, a thief himself, would have been proud of him."[7] Borthwick won the award for 'Best Dramatic Performance from a Young Actor or Actress' at the 2008 British Soap Awards,[8] and was nominated for 'Best Child Actor' at the 2008 Digital Spy Soap Awards.[9] Sharon Watts Ian Beale Dot Cotton Diane Butcher Ricky Butcher Janine Butcher Phil Mitchell Carol Jackson Bianca Jackson Lucy Beale Ben Mitchell Derek Branning Billy Mitchell Liam Butcher Kat Slater Mo Harris Patrick Trueman Alfie Moon Bobby Beale Jean Slater Denise Fox Max Branning Tanya Branning Abi Branning Lauren Branning Janet Mitchell Shirley Carter Jay Brown Zainab Masood Roxy Mitchell Tamwar Masood Masood Ahmed Jack Branning William Mitchell Oscar Branning Christian Clarke Whitney Dean Morgan Jackson-King Tiffany Dean Amy Mitchell Syed Masood Kim Fox Fatboy Kamil Masood Michael Moon Tommy Moon Poppy Meadow Shenice Quinn Cora Cross Tyler Moon Lola Pearce Anthony Moon Rose Cotton Andrew Cotton Yasmin Masood Ray Dixon Sasha Dixon Alice Branning Joey Branning AJ Ahmed Della Alexander Johnny Allen Ruby Allen Tom Banks Geoff Barnes Clare Bates Debbie Bates Laurie Bates Nigel Bates Cindy Beale Jane Beale Kathy Beale Laura Beale Lou Beale Pete Beale Peter Beale Steven Beale Polly Becker Adam Best Manda Best April Branning Bradley Branning Jim Branning Suzy Branning Aidan Brosnan Frank Butcher Mo Butcher Pat Butcher Kelvin Carpenter Tony Carpenter Zsa Zsa Carter Lorna Cartwright Barry Clark Richard Cole Julie Cooper Ashley Cotton Charlie Cotton Dotty Cotton Nick Cotton Stella Crawford Rainie Cross Beppe di Marco Bruno and Luisa di Marco Gianni di Marco Rosa di Marco Jase Dyer Huw Edwards Steve Elliot Nellie Ellis Barry Evans Natalie Evans Roy Evans Ferreira family Conor Flaherty Mary Flaherty Fred Fonseca Arthur Fowler Lisa Fowler Mark Fowler Martin Fowler Michelle Fowler Pauline Fowler Ruth Fowler Sonia Fowler Vicki Fowler Chelsea Fox Libby Fox Joanne Francis Marge Green Jodie Gold  Vanessa Gold Nina Harris Julie Haye Alex Healy Christine Hewitt Ted Hills Tony Hills Garry Hobbs Lynne Hobbs Lofty Holloway Andy Hunter Alan Jackson Billie Jackson Blossom Jackson Carmel Jackson Robbie Jackson Naima Jeffery Saeed Jeffery Al Jenkins Lucas Johnson Danielle Jones Naomi Julien Gita Kapoor Sanjay Kapoor Karim family Yusef Khan Tony King Harold Legg Donna Ludlow Joe Macer Josie McFarlane Mick McFarlane Ryan Malloy Jill Marsden Sal Martin Afia Masood Amira Masood Shabnam Masood Lilly Mattock Darren Miller Demi Miller Keith Miller Mickey Miller Rosie Miller Rob Minter Archie Mitchell Danny Mitchell Glenda Mitchell Grant Mitchell Honey Mitchell Jamie Mitchell Kate Mitchell Little Mo Mitchell Peggy Mitchell Ronnie Mitchell Sam Mitchell Tiffany Mitchell Vinnie Monks Danny Moon Eddie Moon Jake Moon Nana Moon Spencer Moon Trevor Morgan Rod Norman Andy O'Brien Mercy Olubunmi Ali Osman Mehmet Osman Sue Osman Melanie Owen Steve Owen Annie Palmer George Palmer Minty Peterson Frankie Pierre Paul Priestly Irene Raymond Louise Raymond Simon Raymond Terry Raymond Dennis Rickman Binnie Roberts Roly Willy Roper Matthew Rose Eddie Royle Colin Russell Mandy Salter Trevor Short Lydia Simmonds Ethel Skinner Charlie Slater Sean Slater Stacey Slater Zoe Slater Leon Small Gus Smith Mary Smith Dan Sullivan Dawn Swann Celestine and Etta Tavernier Clyde Tavernier Hattie Tavernier Jules Tavernier Kelly Taylor Heather Trott Anthony Trueman Paul Trueman Yolande Trueman Owen Turner Lenny Wallace Angie Watts Chrissie Watts Den Watts Wellard Carly Wicks David Wicks Deano Wicks Joe Wicks Kevin Wicks Lorraine Wicks Simon Wicks Debbie Wilkins Willy James Willmott-Brown May Wright By year: 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Others: Flaherty family Dickens Hill inmates The Banned band members Characters from spin-offs
