Victor 'Vic' Duggan (16 October 1910, West Maitland, New South Wales - 2007)[1] was a motorcycle speedway racer who won the London Riders' Championship in 1947 whilst with the Harringay Racers.[2] He started his career in 1937 with the Hackney Wick Wolves, before spells with the Bristol Bulldogs in 1938 and Wimbledon Dons in 1939. In 1947 he returned to the UK with the Harringay Racers. Was a co-director of the Sydney Sports Ground with Lionel Van Praag and Max Grosskreutz where he held the track record.[1] Ray Duggan won his first Australian Solo Championship in 1941 at the Sydney Sports Ground. He followed this up with the 1947 Aussie title, again at the Sports Ground and backed up to win 3 Aussie titles in 1948 (2 x 2 lap and 1 x 3 lap) at both the Sports Ground and the Sydney Showground Speedway.[3] He was also NSW State Champion in 1940 and 1947. Many believe Vic would have won more Australian and NSW titles had it not been for World War II when racing was suspended. Vic Duggan competed in the 1950 World Final at London's, Wembley Stadium where he finished in 13th place after scoring 4 points. Duggan died in 2007.
