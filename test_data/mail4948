Mouchoir Bank, in Spanish also called Banco de Pauelo Blanco is located southeast of the Turks islands and is geographically a continuation of the Bahamas. It is part of the Turks and Caicos Islands and falls within its EEZ. Much of its north side is awash in two groupings of coral reef. A 1.8 m deep rock lies between the two groupings. There are numerous shallow patches on the bank which break. North East Breaker is a dangerous rock in the northeast. Mouchoir Passage, which separates Mouchoir Bank from the Turks islands, is about 26 kilometres (16mi) wide and very deep. It covers an area of 960 km [1]. Silver Bank Passage separates Mouchoir Bank from Silver Bank further southeast, which belongs to the Dominican Republic. Coordinates: 2057N 7042W / 20.95N 70.7W / 20.95; -70.7
