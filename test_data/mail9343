Content:
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, signed June 3, 1937 (P.L. 75-137), provided authority for federal marketing orders, and also reaffirmed the marketing agreements provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 (P.L. 73-10). Under the authority of this permanent law and subsequent amendments, marketing orders have been established for milk as well as numerous fruits, vegetables, and specialty crops.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
