Houghs Neck (play/haz/) is a one-square-mile (2.6km2) peninsula in Quincy, Massachusetts. It is surrounded by Quincy Bay, Hingham Bay and Rock Island Cove. It is lined by Perry Beach, which runs along Manet Avenue; Nut Island, which is just beyond Great Hill at the very end of the peninsula; and Edgewater Drive. Houghs Neck is commonly referred to by locals as "The Neck," and its residents as "Neckahs" ("Neckers") or "Neckies".[1] Houghs Neck (also "Hough's Neck") is named for Atherton Hough, who was granted the land in 1636 as a farm and orchard.[2] The neighborhood's elementary school is also named for Atherton Hough. The peninsula has been called the "flounder capital of the world" and once hosted six boat rental businesses geared toward catching the bottom dwelling winter flounder that spent the cold weather months in Boston Harbor.[3] Currently, Houghs Neck is a thickly settled neighborhood.[4] Sea Street and Manet Avenue are major thoroughfares in the neighborhood. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority provides service to Houghs Neck with the 216 bus route, which links this area to the Red Line train station in Quincy Center.[5] Coordinates: 421600N 705728W / 42.2667N 70.9578W / 42.2667; -70.9578
