The Prmio Pessoa is a Portuguese award instituted in 1987 by the newspaper Expresso and the IT company Unisys. It is granted annually to the person of Portuguese nationality who during this period, and in the course of previous activity, has distinguished him or herself as a figure in scientific, artistic or literary life. Unisys co-founded and sponsored the prize from 1987 to 2007. From 2008 the prize has been sponsored by Caixa Geral de Depsitos. Translated from the Portuguese Wikipedia
