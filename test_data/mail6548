The Linux Symposium (commonly referred to as OLS, from Ottawa Linux Symposium, though it is not necessarily held in Ottawa) is a Linux and Open Source conference held annually in Canada. It features 100+ paper presentations, tutorials, birds of a feather sessions and mini summits on a wide range of topics. There were 650 attendees from 20+ countries in 2008. The 2009 Symposium was held in Montral, Quebec. The Linux Symposium is one of the three major international grass-roots Linux and Open Source conferences in the world. The other two are linux.conf.au and Linux Kongress. The 2011 Linux Symposium will be held in Ottawa on June 13-15, with the Opening Presentation to be given by long-time Linux proponent Jon "Maddog" Hall. The Call for Participation runs from February 1 through March 15. The Symposium hosts mini summits on the day before the conference. They are open to all conference attendees and have their own programme. Five mini summits were hosted in 2008, including: Virtualization, Security-Enhanced Linux, Kernel Container Developers', Linux Power Management and Linux Wireless LAN. There were two mini summits in 2009: Linux Power Management and Tracing.
