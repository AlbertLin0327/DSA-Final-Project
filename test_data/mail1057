World Chocolate Wonderland (simplified Chinese: ; traditional Chinese: ; pinyin: Shji Qiokl Mnggngyun, literally, "World Chocolate Dream Park") is the first chocolate theme park in China.[1] Located in Beijing to the north of the Bird's Nest, its grand opening was on January 29, 2010.[1] It houses the world's biggest chocolate model of the Great Wall of China.[1] On January 29, 2010, the World Chocolate Wonderland opened to the general public with a fashion show. Models adorned with wigs and dresses made of chocolate strode down the runway. One model wore a dragon costume composed of chocolate gold coins.[2] The theme park's purpose is to "bring a little sweetness" to the Chinese people during the recession.[3] Furthermore, it was designed to allow visitors to learn about chocolate's history and its impact on other cultures.[4] Because of the impending warm weather that would melt the chocolate, World Chocolate Wonderland closes in April of each year and reopens in January of the next year.[5] The theme park is 215,000 square feet (20,000m2) long and contains exhibitions that are fabricated from 176,000 pounds of chocolate.[3] There are three exhibition halls which are temperature-controlled so that the chocolate exhibits, which are enclosed by large glass panes, will not melt.[5] The park showcases the world's biggest chocolate model of the Great Wall of China.[6] The Great Wall replication is 12 metres (39ft) long.[4] The admission fee is 80 yuan (12 dollars) per ticket. World Chocolate Wonderland contains a replica of the famous Terracotta Army. The exhibit comprises 500 life-size figures made from chocolate. It exhibits chocolate shoes and clothes, as well as a BMW car that is made from 2 tons of chocolate.[4] The car required ten craftsmen and six months to build.[5]
