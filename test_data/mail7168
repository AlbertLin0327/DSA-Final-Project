Louis Charles Breguet (January 2, 1880 in Paris  May 4, 1955 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) was a French aircraft designer and builder, one of the early aviation pioneers. In 1902, Louis married Nelly Girardet, the daughter of painter Eugene Girardet. They had five children together. In 1905, with his brother Jacques, and under the guidance of Charles Richet, he began work on a gyroplane (the forerunner of the helicopter) with flexible wings. It achieved the first ascent of a vertical-flight aircraft with a pilot in 1907. He built his first fixed-wing aircraft, the Breguet Type I in 1909, flying it successfully before crashing it at the Grande Semaine d'Aviation held at Reims. In 1911 he founded the Socit Anonyme des Ateliers d'Aviation Louis Breguet. In 1912, Breguet constructed his first hydroplane. He is especially known for his development of reconnaissance aircraft used by the French in World War I and through the 1920s. One of the pioneers in the construction of metal aircraft, the Breguet 14 day bomber, perhaps the most famous French warplane of all time, was made almost entirely of aluminium. As well as the French, sixteen squadrons of the American Expeditionary Force also used it. A plane of this type has a major role in the plot of the 1927 thriller So Disdained by Nevil Shute. In 1919, he founded the Compagnie des Messageries Aeriennes, which evolved into Air France. Over the years, his aircraft set several records. A Breguet plane made the first nonstop crossing of the South Atlantic in 1927. Another made a 4,500-mile (7,200km) flight across the Atlantic Ocean in 1933, the longest nonstop Atlantic flight up to that time. He returned to his work on the gyroplane in 1935. Created with co-designer Ren Dorand, the craft, called the Gyroplane Laboratoire, flew by a combination of blade flapping and feathering. On December 22, 1935, it established a speed record of 67mph (108km/h). It was the first to demonstrate speed as well as good control characteristics. The next year, it set an altitude record of 517feet (158m). Breguet remained an important manufacturer of aircraft during World War II and afterwards developed commercial transports. Breguets range equation, for determining aircraft range, is also named after him. He died of a heart attack in 1955 at Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Breguet, as helmsmen of his 8Metre yacht Namousa, won a bronze medal in sailing during the 1924 Summer Olympics.
