Strand was an island on the west coast of Nordfriesland in modern Germany. Strand was formed by a stormflood on January 16, 1362 where many villages and towns, Rungholt among them, were lost and Sdfall island was as well separated from the mainland. Strand island was later split by the Burchardi flood of 1634 into the islands Nordstrand, Pellworm, and Nordstrandischmoor. Coordinates: 5432N 847E / 54.533N 8.783E / 54.533; 8.783
