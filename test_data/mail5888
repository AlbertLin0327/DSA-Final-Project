Refik abanadovi (born 2 August 1965 in Tuzi, Montenegro, SFR Yugoslavia) is a retired Montenegrin-born Bosnian footballer. His career began in a small Montenegrin club FK Dei Tuzi. He was spotted there by Titograd's FK Budunost and moved there shortly after. Before the 1983/1984 season, he moved to FK eljezniar Sarajevo where he became one of the more notable Yugoslav defenders under the guidance of Ivica Osim. He gave his contribution to the club's best European result, UEFA Cup semifinals in 1984/1985 season. After four seasons playing for this Bosnian side, he left for Red Star Belgrade. He won three championship titles and one national cup at the club, but the most important moment of his entire career was winning the UEFA Champions' Cup in 1990/1991 season. After that, he went to Greece. He played for AEK Athens where he was brought by head coach Duan Bajevi. There he won three consecutive championships in 1992, 1993. and 1994. abanadovi then transferred to Olympiakos where he also played under coach Bajevi and won yet another title in 1997. In the winter of 1998, abanadovi moved to Major League Soccer club Kansas City Wizards where he came on the recommendation of his friend Preki Radosavljevi. He played there for two years before finally retiring at the end of 1999 season. abanadovi's appearances in the Yugoslav national team were largely sporadic. With 8 caps in total (6 starts and 2 substitute appearances) spanning four years from 1986 until 1990, all under head coach Ivica Osim, the highlight of abanadovi's time with the national team was his appearance at the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy. Though he made 4 starting appearances during the competition, with confident defensive displays, he is mostly remembered for getting sent-off in the 31st minute of the quarter-final versus Argentina. abanadovi made his national team debut on 29 October 1986, as a starter in defensive line in the opening Euro 88 qualifier versus Turkey in Split.[1] National team head coach Ivica Osim (only in his 4th match overall leading the squad and his first one doing it alone as he previously shared the coaching duties with Ivan Toplak) knew the 21-year-old eljezniar defender well from their time together at Grbavica, and decided to include him in the team as a result of the injury incurred by defensive mainstay Faruk Hadibegi, thereby causing a bit of a surprise by having a debutante in the starting lineup of a competitive match. In fact abanadovi was one of three players to get a start on their debut that day - the other two being yet another eljo youngster Radmilo Mihajlovi (about to turn 22 year old) and Rijeka goalkeeper Mauro Ravni (almost 27 years of age). Yugoslavia recorded a comfortable 4-0 win, with abanadovi putting in a decent performance. Two weeks later Yugoslavia traveled to Wembley for a pivotal qualifier versus Bobby Robson's England. abanadovi again got the start in defence, but unfortunatelly this time had a match to forget much like the rest of the Yugoslav team as they lost easily 0-2. He didn't feature again for the rest of the qualifying cycle as Hadibegi recovered from injury. It was almost two years before abanadovi saw national team action again. In mid October 1988, Yugoslavia played its opening 1990 World Cup qualifier in Glasgow versus Scotland. With the score tied at 1-1, looking to protect the draw, Osim brought the defender on for attacking midfielder Bora Cvetkovi in the 89th minute. Those few minutes were abanadovi's only action of the entire qualifying cycle as he got called up a few more times, but remained an unused sub. Yugoslavia finished the group on top thus qualifying to the final tournament in Italy. The April 1990 inclusion of 24-year-old abanadovi in Osim's final squad for the World Cup came as a surprise considering he only played several minutes in qualifiers and had only one substitute appearance in the pre-World Cup friendlies - the match versus Spain in Ljubljana. For the group stage opener versus Germany at San Siro, abanadovi was on the bench and didn't get a single minute of action. Due to the heavy opening loss, for the next group match against Colombia in Bologna Osim decided to reshuffle the defensive line, benching Zoran Vuli and Mirsad Balji while giving abanadovi and Vujadin Stanojkovi a start. abanadovi played the full ninety as Yugoslavia recorded a hard-fought 1-0 win. In the final group match versus minnows United Arab Emirates, he again got the start before getting subbed off towards the end for club teammate Robert Prosineki as Yugoslavia managed an easy 4-1 win. For the knockout stage versus Spain, abanadovi again got the start and repaid the coach's trust with a confident display as Yugoslavia progressed with a 2-1 extra-time win. By now, abanadovi's stock in Osim's eyes was sufficiently high that the coach gave him the uneviable task of guarding Diego Maradona in the quarter-final versus Argentina in Florence. Unfortunatelly, the matchup ended very early for abanadovi as he collected two yellow cards in the span of only seven minutes during first half: the first for what the Swiss referee Kurt Rthlisberger ajudged to be improper behaviour during the setting up of the Yugoslav wall before Argentinian free-kick and the second one in the 31st minute for a foul on Maradona. Until the end, the 10-man Yugoslavia fought bravely, creating several excellent goal-scoring opportunites, but eventually lost on penalties in heart-breaking fashion. abanadovi never played for the national team again. In total, he collected 8 caps for the Yugoslav national team. In March 1993, while the Bosnian War was raging, 27-year-old abanadovi took part in two friendly matches as part of "Bosnia-Herzegovina Humanitarian Stars" versus K.R.C. Genk and 1. FC Kaiserslautern in Genk and Koblenz, respectively.[2] The hastily arranged team also featured many Bosnia-born players who previously played for the Yugoslav national team such as Faruk Hadibegi, Safet Sui, Mehmed Badarevi, Mirsad Balji, Davor Jozi, Bla Slikovi, Haris koro, Semir Tuce, Meho Kodro, Predrag Juri, and Husref Musemi. Though the matches only had humanitarian character, they were played with FIFA's approval and were widely seen as the first step in the eventual formation of the Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team. Once the Bosnian national team started playing official matches in late November 1995, abanadovi didn't make further appearances. abanadovi lives in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina with his wife Zerina Dervievi and their four children.[3] On 15 October 1987, only three months after transferring to Red Star Belgrade from FK eljezniar, abanadovi played his first match back in Sarajevo against his old club. Early on in the said league contest at Grbavica Stadium, abanadovi collided with Zoran Slikovi going up for a header. The impact was so powerful that abanadovi ended up in coma for 3 days. He was immediately airlifted by helicopter to Belgrade and hospitalized for a month. Luckily, he recovered completely and returned to competitive action about six months later to great success. Couple of months after returning to football, he was named to the Olympic squad taken to Seoul during summer 1988. Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Red Star Greece AEK Greece Olympiakos
