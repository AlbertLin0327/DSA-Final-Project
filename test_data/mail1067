 Norma Ford was played by Diana Davies. Norma moved to the street in 1972 and got a job as Maggie Clegg's assistant in the Corner Shop. In 1973 she embarked on a relationship with Ken Barlow, but it did not last long, as he eventually left her for Janet Reid. Shortly after Ken and Janet's wedding, Norma left the area. She came back briefly in 1974 for Maggie's wedding to businessman Ron Cooke and left again after the ceremony.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
