The 4-mile (6.4km) safari contains about 600+ animals from around 40 different species from Europe, Africa, North America and Asia. Along with the 4 mile-safari is a large amusement park and a 'Discovery Trail' including reptile and insect houses. There is also access to Spring Grove House, the grounds of which the park is built in. West Midland Safari Park is the home to the only pride of White Lions in the UK and has branded itself 'Home of the White Lions' The park is a member of the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) and the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). The dhole enclosure in the safari is a heathland Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Before you enter the Dhole enclosure the park are now breeding Adders to release them back into the wild across the UK. The park contains the largest pride of White Lions, The largest Coalition of Cheetah, The Largest Streak of White Tiger, The largest Pod of Common Hippopotamus and the largest Lemur walk-through exhibit, along with the largest Mob of Meerkats in the UK. It was also the first park in the UK outside of Africa to have the Big Five game animals. Asian Reserve Continued: Discovery Trail consists of mostly indoor exhibits, and includes animal encounters throughout the day where staff allow visitors to get up close and personal to animals found in the Discovery Trail. The animal encounters that take place in the Discovery Trail allow visitors to get up close and personal with small exotic creatures, under the observation of staff. Creepy Crawlies is the park's insect house, and contains a small range of creepy crawlies. The park's reptile house is named after the famous herpetologist Mark O'Shea. O'Shea also makes appearances at the park, occasionally performing in the reptile encounters that take place outside the building, where guests can learn more about some of the park's reptiles. The sea lion theatre is a 525 seat venue that allows the park's visitors the chance to see the park's California Sea Lions performing tricks in a show. SeaQuarium is the park's aquarium, containing a wide variety of exotic fish. This is also the park's chain attration. The Twilight Cave is a walk-through exhibit, containing free-flying bats and a smaller exhibit within the main exhibit. West Midland Safari Park marked 2004 as a special year with the introduction of the UKs first ever pride of rare African white lions the 4 Lions came from the sister park Ongarva in Namibia, the one male and 3 females form the attraction Kingdom of the white lions. In 2007 four cubs were born in the space of nine hours, not only the first born in the UK and at the park but doubling the pride from just four to eight, Two weeks later another two cubs was born bring the total to ten. The biggest and only pride of white lions in the UK. The park now branded "WMSP, Home of the White Lions" and that year marketed Kingdom Of The White Lions, The Legend Grows.[1] Kingdom Of The White Lions now holds the UK's largest Pride of White Lions with a total of 20 making the pride. In January 2011 the park named 'kingdom of the White Lions' the park's greatest animal exhibits in its 37-year history.[2] In the amusement area there are a large number of lakes. One of these lakes have become home to the largest pod of Hippopotamus in the UK. At the entrance to the Discovery Trail is a new exhibit, opened in 2011, containing a group of Humboldt Penguins.[3] The African Village is an interactive walk-through area, allowing visitors to see African village wildlife and a replica African Village Home. The African Village contains a walk-through area containing Cameroon Sheep, Pygmy Goats and Somali Sheep. The exhibit also contains an extensive Meerkat exhibit, containing a large mob of meerkats. In the wooded area towards the rear of the amusement park can be found the largest walk-through lemur exhibit in the UK. The lemurs are free to roam around the walkway and the woods, making this an interactive experience for visitors. There are three species of lemur on display in the woods: There are many rides and attractions found in the amusement park. Wristbands can be bought from the kiosk to allow an unlimited number of rides. However, tickets are also available for purchase for individual rides. Cubs Kingdom contains seven rides and attractions for young children to use. These are: These rides are designed for the whole family, from youngsters to the elderly. For the thrillseekers, these rides are not for the faint-hearted. Found throughout the amusement area are many eateries. These include cafes, such as Explorer's Cafe, fast food restaurants, such as Botswana Burger Company and food stalls that are dotted around the rides. There are a number of gift shops found in the amusement area, and these sell a number of products, from guide books to soft toys. A 15in(381mm) narrow gauge railway runs between the main car park and the amusement area. Services are operated by a 2-8-0 steam outline diesel locomotive, built by Severn Lamb in 1979. The engine usually runs chimney first to the amusement area, running tender first on the return trip. This railway, when operating, provides a scenic ride between the amusement area and the car park. The track makes its way along the back of the walkways and crosses access-roads via level crossings. The line then rounds Hippo Lakes before arriving at its terminus adjacent to the African Big Apple Coaster. Plans are in place to build a safari themed hotel and water park at the park. West Midland Safari Park is well known for its efforts in conservation. It is public in stating its intentions to create a collection of animals that are in need of help in the wild. The park has replaced many species of animal with a similar, but more endangered species. The park contains many animals that are on the IUCN's endangered or critically endangered list. Ongava Game Reserve is the Sister Park to West Midland Safari Park in Namibia, it is on the boundary of the famous Etosha National Park and is the largest privately owned game reserve in Namibia. Established in 1991 by converting four livestock farms, OGR is one of few private game reserves in south Africa with successful breeding populations of both Black and White Rhinoceros. Additionally, rare black-faced impala has been reintroduced to OGR, and this now ranks as one of the largest and most important populations outside of Etosha. Large game such as Burchells Zebra, Gemsbok, Giraffe, eland, and springbok also inhabit the reserve. In 2006 the managing directors of West Midland Safari Park officially opened the Ongava Research Centre (ORC). ORC focuses on research on Rhinos, Lions, and carrying capacity of the reserves. The research is under taken by three full time researchers who also work closely with the management of OGR, Save the Rhinos and the University of Cape Town. ORC is also regularly visited by Safari Staff for training. There are plans in place for the public to be able to take safari holidays at the reserves.[4] In 2001 West Midland Safari Park brought two Sea Life Centres in Rhyl and Weston-super-Mare from Merlin Entertainment, and created 'Seaquarium' conservation centres for rare sea wildlife. There is also the original Seaquarium at the park. [5] The elephant team at WMSP have been training the parks two female African elephants ready for the torch relay that will pass the elephant enclosure (24/05/12) on the Severn Valley Railway they were trained to wave the union jack flag as the train stopped by their enclosure to support the London Olympics 2012.
