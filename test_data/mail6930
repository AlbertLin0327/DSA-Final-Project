Kosovo unilaterally adopted the Euro as its currency in 2002; however, it is not an official Eurozone member. During the disintegration of Yugoslavia in the 1990s Kosovo unsuccessfully attempted to gain independence, and in 1998-1999 the situation escalated with the Kosovo War. Kosovo unilaterally declared independence on 17 February 2008. As of 1 June 2012, 91 out of 193 (47.2%) United Nations member states have formally recognised the Republic of Kosovo as an independent state. Notably, 22 out of 27 (81%) member states of the European Union and 24 out of 28 (86%) member states of NATO have recognised Kosovo. Serbia refuses to recognise it. Before the establishment of UNMIK, Kosovo (as part of Serbia) was bound to Yugoslav monetary policy, and the Yugoslav Dinar. However, war-time inflation and tensions with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had severely discredited the Yugoslav Dinar in Kosovo. As a result people preferred to use and hoard foreign currencies instead of relying on the Dinar. The most frequently used foreign currency was the German Mark, although the US Dollar and Swiss Franc were also widely used. In the immediate post-conflict period, other currencies - especially the deutschmark - were widely used alongside the dinar. In September 1999, UNMIK produced a regulation accepting the use of other currencies; this recognised the status quo.[1] The Yugoslav Dinar was never officially withdrawn from circulation, but its use was not encouraged. The use of other currencies, mainly the U.S. Dollar, also continued.[2] (Tagesspiegel,1999). The Bundesbank was not informed in advance, and did not send any additional coins and notes to Kosovo for the changeover. But since there were no restrictions on the import and export of German marks, and many Kosovars working abroad had sent money home, it was possible to supply Kosovo with sufficient marks. The Yugoslav (and later Serbian) Dinar continued to be widely used in Northern Kosovo and Serb enclaves throughout Kosovo. Like Germany, Kosovo switched to the euro on 1 January 2002. The German Mark remained legal tender in Kosovo until 9 March 2002. The change to the euro was achieved in cooperation with the European Central Bank, and several national banks in the Eurozone. By December 2001, about 100 million euro in cash was frontloaded to the Banking and Payments Authority of Kosovo. Kosovo does not mint any coins of its own.
