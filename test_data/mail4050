The Wesleyan Holiness Consortium is a holiness movement organization which seeks to reconceive and promote Biblical holiness in today's churches,[1] particularly those who are historically rooted in the evangelical movement initiated by the Rt. Rev. John Wesley, namely Methodists and Pentecostals.[1] The Wesleyan Holiness Consortium aims to guide efforts and projects focused on holiness in the 21st century for pastors, unity within and among the participating churches, a holiness voice to the broader church, and the importance of holiness in the future mission of the church.[2]
