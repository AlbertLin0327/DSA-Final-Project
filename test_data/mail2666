Lszl Harasztosi, also known as Lazlo Hypnotist, is a psychic, bioenergeticist, and alternative medicine practitioner. His speciality is attaching metal objects on human bodies. When breaking the Guinness record in 1998, he placed two disks weighing altogether 57,64kg (127lbs) on Lszl Feketes chest (the strongest man of Hungary[1]). His activity consists of healing, performances in shows, and preparation of sportspeople. Cosmos Church of Universal Love was founded with his leadership.[2][3][4] His book titled Cosmic energy  how autotherapy works and how to use the healing coin was published in 1996.[5] He was born on June 28, 1963, in the Eastern Hungarian village of Berettyjfalu. As he stated, his ability was discovered at the age of seven, when they noticed that his touch stops pain and his presence calms down children who have gone wild.[6] Before the change of regime of 1989 in Hungary, he had to conceal his abilities for political reasons. He claims to regularly charge up chosen sportspeople with focused cosmic energy, which creates further resources for them, enabling them to achieve better results, hold on longer, make their muscles more flexible and more enduring, and their reaction time becomes shorter. Besides, they will need considerably less time to regenerate after injuries or fatigue caused by training or competitions.[7][8] He appeared in Hungary in the programme Esti Showder by RTL Klub, among other programmes.[9][10]
