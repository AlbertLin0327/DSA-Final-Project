Michael Joseph O'Farrell (December 2, 1832  April 2, 1894) was an Irish-born prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He was the first Bishop of Trenton (18811894). Michael O'Farrell was born in Limerick, and studied the classics and philosophy at All Hallows College in Dublin.[1] He then studied theology at the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice in Paris, France, where he joined the Society of Saint-Sulpice (more commonly known as the Sulpicians).[1] Returning to Ireland, was ordained to the priesthood on August 18, 1855.[2] He was sent by his superiors to the Grand Seminary of Montreal in Quebec, Canada, where he taught dogmatic theology.[1] In 1869 he left the Sulpicians and was incardinated into the Diocese of New York in the United States.[1] He served as a curate at St. Peter's Church in New York City until 1872, when he became pastor of St. Mary's Church in Rondout.[1] After a brief tenure at St. Mary's, he returned to St. Peter's in 1873 as its pastor.[1] On August 11, 1881, O'Farrell was appointed the first Bishop of the newly-erected Diocese of Trenton, New Jersey, by Pope Leo XIII.[2] He received his episcopal consecration on the following November 1 from Cardinal John McCloskey, with Archbishop Michael Corrigan and Bishop John Loughlin serving as co-consecrators.[2] During his tenure, he erected several new parishes and missions, and established an orphanage in New Brunswick and a home for the aged in Beverly.[1] He also attended the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore in 1884.[1] At the beginning of his tenure, the diocese contained 51 priests, 60 churches, and 24 parochial schools; by the time of his death, there were 92 priests, 101 churches, and 82 parochial schools. O'Farrell later died at age 61.
