The Indonesian Army (Indonesian: Tentara Nasional Indonesia Angkatan Darat, TNIAD), the land component of the Indonesian National Armed Forces, has an estimated strength of 233,000 regular personnel.[citation needed] The force's history began in 1945 when the Tentara Keamanan Rakyat (TKR) "Civil Security Forces" served as paramilitary and police. Since the nation's independence struggle, the Indonesian Army has been involved in many operations involving foreign powers such as the incorporation of Western New Guinea, the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and the annexation of East Timor, as well as with internal operations in Aceh and Maluku. Like the Indonesian military as a whole, it has been involved in numerous human rights violations, especially in West Papua, East Timor and Aceh.[2][3] The Indonesia Army comprises the headquarters and associated units, the military area commands, a strategic reserve command KOSTRAD, a special forces command Kopassus, and other formations and units. The force has grown over the years; in July 1976 the army was estimated to consist of 180,000 personnel, one armoured cavalry brigade, part of Kostrad (one tank battalion, plus support units), 14 infantry brigades (90 infantry, 1 para, 9 artillery, 11 anti-aircraft, and 9 engineer battalions) of which three of the brigades were in Kostrad, two airborne brigades totaling six battalions, also part of Kostrad, one independent tank battalion, 7 independent armoured cavalry battalions, and four independent para-commando battalions.[4] The Armed Forces' military districts were created by General Soedirman, following the model of the German Wehrkreise system. The system was later ratified in Surat Perintah Siasat No.1, signed by General Soedirman in November 1948. From 1946 to 1952, the Army had been organised into numerous divisions. These were consolidated in 1951, and then eliminated in 1952. From 1952 to 1958-59, the Army was organised into seven Tentara & Teritoriums. In August 1958, the Indonesian Army reorganised its territorial commands. There were to be sixteen Kodams from that point in time, which retained earlier divisional titles; the Siliwangi Division, for example, became Kodam VI/Siliwangi.[5] A reorganization in 1985 made significant changes in the army chain of command. The four multiservice Regional Defense Commands (Kowilhans) and the National Strategic Command (Kostranas) were eliminated from the defense structure, re-establishing the Military Area Command (Kodam), or regional command, as the key organization for strategic, tactical, and territorial operations for all services.[6] The chain of command flowed directly from the ABRI commander in chief to the ten Kodam commanders, and then to subordinate army territorial commands. The Kodams incorporate provincial and district commands each with a number of infantry battalions, sometimes a cavalry battalion, artillery, or engineers.[7] Some have Raider battalions attached. Currently there are 12 Military Area Commands, and these are: The Army had planned to buy 100 Leopard 2A6s from the Netherlands in November 2011.[16] If the Netherlands had approved the sale of Leopard 2A6s to Indonesia, the delivery was to have taken place by 2014. The proposal caused controversy, as there is an ongoing debate as to whether the tank is suitable for Indonesian terrain. The GroenLinks party of the Dutch Parliament also expressed concern of the purchase. Indonesia gave the Netherlands a deadline to decide whether or not to sell its surplus Leopards after which Indonesia will look for other sources.[17] Indonesia also had planned to buy the German-made MBT from its origin country, just in case Netherlands didn't approve the sale. The plan was to buy the 2A4 variant from storage and then upgrade to the 2A6 or take up KMW's offer of upgrading to the Leopard 2A7, although the quantity of tanks offered by Germany might be different than than the Dutch offer.[citation needed] On 24 May 2012, General Pramono Edhie Wibowo announced that Germany has agreed, and that 30 vehicles should arrive by October and that the second batch will be delivered in 2013.[18] Indonesia also plans to acquire unknown number of CAESAR self-propelled howitzer from France[30].
