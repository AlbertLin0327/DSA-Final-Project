Steal This Record is the fourth album by the Detroit, Michigan punk rock band The Suicide Machines, released in 2001 by Hollywood Records. It was the band's last album for the Hollywood label, as they moved to Side One Dummy Records the following year. It was also their last album with longtime bassist Royce Nunley, who left the group in 2002. The album's musical direction mixes the pop punk style the band had explored on their previous album The Suicide Machines with elements of the ska punk and hardcore styles of their first two albums. All songs written by The Suicide Machines except where noted
