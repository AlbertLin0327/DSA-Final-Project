It can be found within one degree of the star Vega.[3] The brightest star, 7th magnitude HD 171384, possesses a spectral type of F8, meaning it is yellowish white and its surface temperature ranges from 6,000 to 7,500 kelvin.[1] Its optical companion is a yellow 8th magnitude star with a spectral type of G5, and therefore it has a surface temperature of 5,000 to 6,000 kelvin.[2] IDS 18295+3846 C is listed in the Index catalogue of visual double stars (IDS) and the 2 Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) of an unspecified magnitude.[4]
