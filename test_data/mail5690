Content:
ArcXML is a proprietary XML standard created by ESRI to be used in ArcIMS, a web mapping server that is part of the ArcGIS suite of applications. Static files are often saved with a ".axl" extension and are therefore called axl (pronounced 'Axel') files by those that use them. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
