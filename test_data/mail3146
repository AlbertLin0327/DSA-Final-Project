Spaces with Iron is a public sculpture by American artist Will Horwitt on the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) campus, which is near downtown Indianapolis, Indiana. It is located on the corner of Blackford Street and Vermont Street on the southeast lawn of the Science Building. This piece was placed on campus in late January 2009 on long term loan from the Indianapolis Museum of Art.[1] The sculpture was created in 1972 and is made of cast iron and bronze.[2] It measures 4feet 6inches (1.37m) high, 7 feet (2.1m) wide, and 5feet 8+34 inches (1.746m) long.[3] Spaces with Iron consists of two 3-inch-thick (76mm) hollow rectangular pieces. One rectangle is composed of bronze and the other of cast iron. The sculpture sits on a cylindrical shaped concrete base. The cast iron rectangular piece is taller than the bronze piece. The bronze piece, however, is wider than the cast iron piece. A bronze "board-like" piece rests on the bottom of both rectangular pieces. A bronze rectangular cuboid is placed on top of each rectangular piece on the proper left side of the sculpture. Both of these cuboids hang off the side of the rectangular pieces. Spaces with Iron "draws attention to the negative spaces created by the sculpture's openings as well as the environment in which it resides." [4] The IMA accession number for Spaces with Iron is 81.220, meaning it was the 220th piece acquired in 1981.[5] It was acquired through the Helen Benjamin Fund.[6] Will Horwitt was born in New York City in 1934, but spent his adolescence in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. From 1952 to 1954, he studied at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1965, he received the Guggenheim Fellowship for creative sculpture. Three years later, he was awarded the Tiffany Purchase Grant.[7] New York Times art critic, Art Canaday, commends Horwitt because he "is a most gratifying workman. . .The simplified subtly warped forms in expressive balances are consistently mindful of Brancusi, but that is a good point of departure. Mr. Horwitt comes through as one of the strongest young sculptures around.".[8] Horwitt's works are included in many private and public collections, including those of Nelson Rockefeller, Vera and Albert List, and Helen and Robert Benjamin.[9] His sculptures are also featured in the Yale University Art Gallery, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Wadsworth Atheneum, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, the Neuberger Museum of Art, the Empire State Collection, and now IUPUI.[10][11] Will Horwitt's works are strongly rooted in geometric forms. His minimalist pieces have been favorably viewed by many critics throughout his career. Horwitt "reflects [on] the dominance of a certain preoccupation with the language of the space and lines that express the evocative forms of both his drawings and sculptures."[12] According to Al Brunelle, writer for Art in America, Horwitt's pieces are, "expressive. . . they transmit a feeling that is vital and concrete like everyday life experience." [13] His last exhibition was at the Vanderwoude Tananbaum Gallery in New York City.[14] He died of lymphoma in 1985 in New York City. He was fifty one years old at the time of his death. Spaces with Iron was purchased by the Helen Benjamin Fund for the IMA. In 1985 it was moved from the southwest to the southwest corner of the sculpture court directly to the north of the Krannert Paviliton. It was moved again in 1990 to the IMAs lawn by the parking lot to either the north or west side. Spaces with Iron is currently located on the corner of Blackford Street and Vermont Street on the south-east lawn of the Science Building on the campus of IUPUI. Spaces with Iron is one of four pieces on long term loan to IUPUI from the Indianapolis Museum of Art. This piece was placed on campus in late January 2009 along with three other outdoor sculptures on loan from the Indianapolis Museum of Art.[15]The other pieces include Portrait of History, Mega-Gem, and East Gate/West Gate. All pieces except East Gate/West Gate were transported to IUPUI in January 2009. Due to its size, East Gate/West Gate was flown by helicopter to campus in March 2009. These four pieces are to become a part of the Indianapolis Cultural Trail which, "connects neighborhoods, entertainment facilities and the city's five cultural districts," including Indiana Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, Indianapolis, Fountain Square, Indianapolis, the Wholesale District, Indianapolis, and White River State Park.[16] The Cultural Trail, set to be completed by 2011, will be a bike and pedestrian path in downtown Indianapolis that will connect to Broad Ripple Village, Indianapolis through the Monon Trail.[17] = Coordinates: 3946.381N 8610.218W / 39.773017N 86.1703W / 39.773017; -86.1703
