John Ernest Parker (2 July 1871 in Plantation Vigilance, East Coast, Demerara, British Guiana  1946 in Georgetown, Demerara, British Guiana) was a West Indian cricketer who toured with the second West Indian touring side to England in 1906. He was a right-handed batsman and leg break/googly bowler. He made his debut in important cricket for British Guiana in the 1905-06 Inter-Colonial Tournament in Trinidad. He scored 6 and 3 and took no wickets. The team for the forthcoming tour of England was decided after this tournament and surprisingly Parker was one of those chosen. He was a complete disappointment on the 1906 tour to England averaging just 6 with the bat and taking just 4 wickets. Before the tour he was described as "a slow bowler of great merit; took part in the late Intercolonial cricket matches played at Trinidad, and, although not successful in getting wickets, greatly impressed the selectors; hence his inclusion in the team"[1] and "a slow bowler of the Armstrong type, with a field placed on the on-side; a fair defensive batsman and excellent slip"[2]. He played in the next two Inter-Colonial Tournaments in 1907-08 and 1907-08 again with a complete lack of success and this marked the end of his career in important matches.
