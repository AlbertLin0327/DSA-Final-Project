Viceroy is a hamlet in Excel Rural Municipality No. 71, Saskatchewan, Canada. The population was 25 at the 2011 Census. The hamlet previously held the status of a village until May 10, 2002. With a population of approximately 30 people, Viceroy seems poised for a comeback, all lots have currently been sold and the local real estate market has picked up with the oil and Potash boom in Saskatchewan and Alberta. Prior to May 10, 2002, Viceroy was incorporated as a village, and was restructured as a hamlet under the jurisdiction of the Rural municipality of Excel on that date.[1] Population: Land area: Population density: Median age: Total private dwellings: Mean household income: 25 (-71.9% from 2006) 1.18km2 (0.46sqmi) 21.3/km2 (55/sqmi) 18   Viceroy is located 7 km south of the historic Red Coat Trail on highway 705 to the north of Willow Bunch Lake adjacent to the famous Big Muddy Valley. Once a bustling community with two schools, two restaurants, Klemenz Poolroom and bowling alley, a theatre and many other businesses. After two fires in the past century the community has shrunk to a much smaller scale. Viceroy still boasts the Viceroy Co-op which in a sense is the local "general store" offering grocery staples, tools, feed, hardware, parts, auto repair and petroleum sales. The RM of Excel No. 71, office is located on main street with the equipment yard/shop to the south. Bengough Credit Union also operates a branch in Viceroy. Viceroy was incorporated in 1912 and will celebrate its centennial on July 7, 2012 with a live band, street dance, kids games and parade. See www.viceroy2012.com for more info
