Abraham Valentine Williams Jackson, L.H.D., Ph.D., LL.D. (February 9, 1862  August 8, 1937) was an American specialist on Indo-Iranian languages. He was born in New York City on February 9, 1862. He graduated from Columbia University in 1883. He was fellow in letters there 1883-86, instructor in Anglo-Saxon and the Iranian languages 1887-90, and, after study at Halle 1887-89, adjunct professor of English language and literature. In 1895, he was appointed public lecturer and also appointed to the newly-founded professorship of Indo-Iranian languages at Columbia University, where he remained until 1935. He was well known as a lecturer on English literature and the Orient. In 1901, during a visit to India and Ceylon, he received special attention from the Parsees, who presented to Columbia a valuable collection of Zoroastrian manuscripts in recognition of the instruction there given by him in their ancient texts. In 1903 he made a second journey to the Orient, this time visiting Persia. He also visited Central Asia sometime before 1918. Jackson's grammar of Avestan, the language used in the Zoroastrian scriptures, is still considered to be the seminal work on the topic. Jackson was one of the directors of the American Oriental Society. He died on August 8, 1937. He made many contributions to the Journal of the American Oriental Society. He edited the Columbia University Indo-Iranian Series (5 vols., 1902), and a History of Persia.
