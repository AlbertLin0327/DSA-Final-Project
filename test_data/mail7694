In the politics of the United States, the Gang of Six is either of two bipartisan groups of six Senators, both consisting of three Democrats and three Republicans. One group, active in 2009, focused on health care reform in the United States during the 111th United States Congress. A different group, currently active as of 2011[update], is following up the compromise on the United States public debt from the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota participated in both groups. During 2009, the Gang of Six consisted of six members of the Senate Finance Committee of the 111th United States Congress who attempted to negotiate a compromise to pass a health care reform bill.[1] Among the bills under consideration at the time were the United States National Health Care Act, the America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, the Healthy Americans Act (WydenBennett), and the Americas Healthy Future Act (Baucus plan). The six states the legislators represented  Iowa, Maine, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Wyoming  had a combined population of 8.4 million, about the same as New York City, or 2.74 percent of the United States as a whole.[2][3] As of 2011[update], the Gang of Six is led by Democrat Mark Warner and Republican Saxby Chambliss and includes four members of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform.[4] In July 2011, the Gang of Six proposed a solution to the US debt ceiling crisis. The compromise would reduce future increases in the deficit by USD $3.7 trillion over ten years and was praised by President Barack Obama.[7][8] However, the figure quoted represents only an estimated reduction in the continued growth of the debt, not an actual reduction compared to the current 2011 deficit level. It also has been met with criticism from congressional Republicans[9][10] and conservative groups for being, according to The Heritage Foundation, "heavy on tax hikes and promises of spending cuts, but devoid of details on how to make the sweeping transformative changes needed to solve our debt and spending crises."[11] A BIPARTISAN PLAN TO REDUCE OUR NATIONS DEFICITS  2011 proposal
