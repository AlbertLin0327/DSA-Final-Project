Kentucky Senatorial Election Results by County, 2004.svg Jim Bunning Republican Jim Bunning Republican The 2004 United States Senate election in Kentucky took place on November 2, 2004 alongside other elections to the United States Senate in other states as well as elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Jim Bunning won re-election to a second term. Democratic primary front runner Paul E. Patton, the Governor, saw his career implode in a scandal over an extramarital affair. Eventually, the Democrats settled on Daniel Mongiardo, a relatively unknown doctor and State Senator from Hazard, Kentucky. 1996  2000  2004  2008 Democratic: 2008 Republican: 2008  2012 1984  1990  1996  1998  2002  2004  2008  2010  2014 2004 (6th)  2006  2008  2010  2012 1991  1995  1999  2003  2007  2011 2007  2011 2010 During his reelection bid in 2004, controversy erupted when Bunning described Mongiardo as looking "like one of Saddam Hussein's sons." Public pressure compelled him to apologize. Bunning later went on to declare that Mongiardo's "thugs" had assaulted his wife.[4][5] Bunning had an estimated $4 million campaign war chest, while Mongiardo had only $600,000. The Democrats began increasing financial support to Mongiardo when it became apparent that Bunning's bizarre behavior was costing him votes, purchasing more than $800,000 worth of additional television airtime on his behalf. The November 2 election was one of the closest in Kentucky history. The race turned out to be very close, with Mongiardo leading with as many as 80% of the returns coming in. However, Bunning eventually won by just over one percentage point. Some analysts felt that because of President George Bush's 20% margin of victory in the state, Bunning was able to effectively ride the President's coattails to victory.
