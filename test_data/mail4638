Its last assignment was with the 64th Air Division, being stationed at Ernest Harmon Air Force Base, Newfoundland, Canada. It was last active 1 July 1960. Formed in 1957 when Air Defense Command (ADC) assumed responsibility for air defense of Newfoundland from Northeast Air Command (NEAC).[1] Was a tenant organization at Ernest Harmon AFB, a Strategic Air Command base, and whose 4081st Air Base Group assumed host base duties from NEAC.[2] Controlled both radar and fighter squadrons in Canada. Assigned the 61st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (FIS), flying Northrop F-89 Scorpion aircraft[3], which was already stationed at Harmon, and two remote Aircraft Control & Warning Squadrons as operational elements.[4][5] These units were transferred from NEAC.[5] In October 1957, the 61st FIS moved to Wisconsin to replace the 323d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which moved from Wisconsin in a swap of stations.[4][6] The 323d FIS, however, flew F-102 Delta Daggers.[7] Provided air defense of northeast North America.
