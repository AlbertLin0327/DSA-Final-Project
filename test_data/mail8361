Jacques Huber (13 October 1867 Schleitheim  1914 Belm) was a Swiss-Brazilian botanist who did pioneering work on the flora of the Amazon from 1895 until his death. He created and organized the herbarium and arboretum in Belm, Brazil, and was director of the Museu Paraense Emlio Goeldi from 1907 until he died.   "Author Query".
