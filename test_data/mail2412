FFWD is an eponymous album by FFWD - Robert Fripp, Thomas Fehlmann, Kris Weston, and Dr. Alex Paterson. The title is also a play on the abbreviation often use on the fast forward control of a tape deck or CD player, also referenced in the "double-arrow" graphic used on the cover. The album peaked at #48 in the UK Albums Chart in August 1994.[2]
