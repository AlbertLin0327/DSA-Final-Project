In mathematics, a StanleyReisner ring is a quotient of a polynomial algebra over a field by a square-free monomial ideal. Such ideals are described more geometrically in terms of finite simplicial complexes. The StanleyReisner ring construction is a basic tool within algebraic combinatorics and combinatorial commutative algebra. Its properties were investigated by Richard Stanley, Melvin Hochster, and Gerald Reisner in the early 1970s. Given an abstract simplicial complex  on the vertex set {x1,,xn} and a field k, the corresponding StanleyReisner ring, or face ring, denoted k[], is obtained from the polynomial ring k[x1,,xn] by quotienting out the ideal I generated by the square-free monomials corresponding to the non-faces of: The ideal I is called the StanleyReisner ideal or the face ideal of. It is common to assume that every vertex {xi} is a simplex in . Thus none of the variables belongs to the StanleyReisner idealI. The face ring k[] is a multigraded algebra over k all of whose components with respect to the fine grading have dimension at most 1. Consequently, its homology can be studied by combinatorial and geometric methods. An abstract simplicial complex  is called CohenMacaulay over k if its face ring is a CohenMacaulay ring. In his 1974 thesis, Gerald Reisner gave a complete characterization of such complexes. This was soon followed up by more precise homological results about face rings due to Melvin Hochster. Then Richard Stanley found a way to prove the Upper Bound Conjecture for simplicial spheres, which was open at the time, using the face ring construction and Reisner's criterion of CohenMacaulayness. Stanley's idea of translating difficult conjectures in algebraic combinatorics into statements from commutative algebra and proving them by means of homological techniques was the origin of the rapidly developing field of combinatorial commutative algebra. A simplicial complex  is CohenMacaulay over k if and only if for all simplices   , all reduced simplicial homology groups of the link of  in  with coefficients in k are zero, except the top dimensional one: A result due to Munkres then shows that the CohenMacaulayness of  over k is a topological property: it depends only on the homeomorphism class of the simplicial complex . Namely, let || be the geometric realization of . Then the vanishing of the simplicial homology groups in Reisner's criterion is equivalent to the following statement about the reduced and relative singular homology groups of ||: In particular, if the complex  is a simplicial sphere, that is, || is homeomorphic to a sphere, then it is CohenMacaulay over any field. This is a key step in Stanley's proof of the Upper Bound Conjecture. By contrast, there are examples of simplicial complexes whose CohenMacaulayness depends on the characteristic of the fieldk.
