"Glorious" is a pop song released by Swedish singer Andreas Johnson in 1999. It is from Johnson's Liebling album on the WEA record label. The song was a mixed success in terms of chart, as it remained in the low positions in the Netherlands, Switzerland, New Zealand and Germany. However, the song debuted at a peak of number four on the UK Singles Chart and totaled eleven weeks on the chart, three of them in the top ten. In Italy, the single started at number three and appeared for nine weeks in the top twenty. The song was later used on television advertisements for Vauxhall, Volvo, and in 2004, for Nutella,[1] thus allowing the song to re-enter the French Singles Chart at a peak of number 16, although the song was only number 50 in its first release, four years earlier. An uncredited instrumental segment of the song was used in the movie The Proposal, after the ceremony.
