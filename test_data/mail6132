Subject: List of UK driving licence endorsements 
To: Abby
Content:
UK driving licences may be endorsed by order of the courts if the driver has been convicted of an offence concerned with driving or operating a vehicle. An endorsement may also be accompanied by a number of points which can remain on the licence for up to 12 years. If the total of points on a licence equals or exceeds 12, the courts may decide to ban a driver for a period of time.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
