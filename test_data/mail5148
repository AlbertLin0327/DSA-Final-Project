Alan William Secord (born March 3, 1958 in Sudbury, Ontario) is a retired professional ice hockey left wing who played in the National Hockey League for twelve seasons from 197879 until 198990.[1] Played on the 1976 Memorial Cup winning team, Hamilton Fincups of the OHA. Secord was drafted 16th overall by the Boston Bruins in the 1978 NHL Amateur Draft. He made the Bruins roster as a 20-year-old, scoring 16 goals and adding seven assists. He improved to 23 goals in 197980, but after failing to score in his first 18 games the following season, he was dealt to the Chicago Black Hawks on December 18, 1980, in a trade for defenceman Mike O'Connell. It was in Chicago where the feisty Secord enjoyed the best years of his NHL career. In 198182, he burst forth with 44 goals in 80 games. He was also assessed 303 minutes in penalties, making him the only player in NHL history to record 40 goals and 300 penalty minutes in a single season[2]. Secord joined the 50-goal club in 198283, posting 54 goals and 32 assists for a career-high 86 points and played in the NHL All-Star game for the second consecutive season. But injuries began to take their toll. He played just 14 games in 198384, and it took him two full seasons to regain his scoring touch. Secord responded with a 40-goal campaign in 198586, but after a 29-goal season in 198687, Secord was dealt to the Toronto Maple Leafs on September 3, 1987. Secord and Ed Olczyk went to Toronto, while Rick Vaive, Steve Thomas and defenceman Bob McGill headed to the Windy City. Secord spent two unremarkable seasons with the Maple Leafs, and was sent to the Philadelphia Flyers midway through 198889 for a fifth-round draft pick in 1989 that the Buffalo Sabres eventually used to select defenceman Keith Carney. Secord re-signed with Chicago as a free agent and finished his NHL career in 1990, scoring 14 times in 43 games. He retired from pro hockey until 1994, when he returned to play two seasons with the International Hockey League (now American Hockey League) Chicago Wolves. He also played a season of roller hockey with the Chicago Cheetahs. Secord played 766 career NHL games, scoring 273 goals and 222 assists for 495 points and registered 2093 career penalty minutes. Secord is now an airline pilot with American Airlines and resides in Southlake, Texas, a suburb of Fort Worth. He has three sons, Ryan, Alec and Luke. He sometimes does work on behalf of the Chicago Blackhawks' Alumni Association. Secord also coaches youth hockey in the Dallas area with the Texas Jr. Brahmas organization.
