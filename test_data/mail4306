Pieter Leermans (ca.1635, Leiden  1706), was a Dutch Golden Age painter. According to the RKD he was a portrait painter of historical allegories.[1] He is also known as Lieremans.[1] Little is known of his life, but he is considered to be one of the Leiden fijnschilders, as his "Hermit" in Dresden shows Gerard Dou's influence.[2]
