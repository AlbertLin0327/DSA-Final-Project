WJJG (1530 AM) is a radio station licensed to Elmhurst, Illinois, USA. The station serves the Chicago area. The station is licensed to Joseph J. Gentile; however, he died on October 10, 2011.[1] AM 1530 signed on the air October 10, 1974. The stations call letters were originally WKDC representing the signal coverage in Will, Kane, DuPage and Cook counties. The studios were built for stereo (Cetec Sparta stereo audio equipment) although it was not until 1976 when the FCC authorized the station to test AM stereo. Daytime and night-time findings on AM stereo were presented at the 1977 NAB Convention in Washington, DC. In 1994, AM 1530 changed its call sign to WJJG. The call letters stand for owner Joseph J. Gentile. Joes nickname is The Baron of Barrington, where he owned a Chrysler-Plymouth dealership for many years. On May 6, 2012, WJJG began simulcasting internet radio station Q101. Hours of operation are determined by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rule concurring daytime broadcasting varying monthly with the changes in sunrise and sunset.
