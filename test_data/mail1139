Roots and Wings is the second and final studio album released by American country music artist James Bonamy. It was released June 24, 1997 on Epic Records Nashville. The single "The Swing" was a number 31 on the Billboard country charts in 1997. "Naked to the Pain" and "Little Blue Dot" were both released as singles as well, although neither reached Top 40. The title track was previously recorded by Doug Supernaw on his 1995 album You Still Got Me. Thom Owens of Allmusic rated the album three stars out of five, calling the album's content "uneven" but saying that Bonamy "is singing better than ever".[1] Larry Stephens of Country Standard Time was less favorable, saying that Bonamy "sounds like a pop singer trying to do country". He thought that "Daddy Never Had a Chance in Hell" was the best-written song, and that the title track was "touching".[2]
