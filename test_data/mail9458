The Church of St Peterin Huish Champflower, Somerset, England dates from the 15th century, with the north aisle being built in 1534. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.[1] It was built on the site of an earlier Norman church although nothing of the previous structure remains.[2] The tower arch dates from 1703, and the building was restored in 187580 when the chancel arch was rebuilt. It includes a tower with five bells, one of which was made in 1790 by Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family in Cullompton.[3] The church includes stained glass claimed to be from the remains of a Jesse window from Barlynch Priory near Dulverton, and a 15th-century lectern.[4] The parish is part of the Wiveliscombe and the Hills mbenefice within the Tone deanery.[5] A service is held at the church once a month.[6]
