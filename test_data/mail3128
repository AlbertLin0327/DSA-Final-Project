The Crazy World of Arthur Brown are an English psychedelic rock band formed by singer Arthur Brown in 1967. Their song "Fire" (released in 1968 as a single) was one of the one-hit wonders in the United Kingdom and United States in the 1960s. "Fire" sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.[1] The line-up practically dissolved on US tour in 1969. Crane and Palmer left to form Atomic Rooster, Greenwood (known as Sean Nicholas during his stay in CWOAB) went on to Khan[2] (as Nick Greenwood), Theaker to Love and then Rustic Hinge, and Brown to Kingdom Come. The band re-formed in 2000 and released Tantric Lover.
