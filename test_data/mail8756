The 1975 BYU Cougars football team represented Brigham Young University during the 1975 college football season. [1]  Gifford Nielsen passed and ran for two touchdowns and Brigham Young's defense turned Utah fumbles into three more scores in the 51-20 rout. Mark Uselman also kicked field goals of 47, 47 and 44 yards as the Cougars won their fourth in a row in the series.[2]
