Tyke, also known as 'George' and carrying the service number 1263 MEPS 43, was a male Second World War homing pigeon who was awarded the Dickin Medal for gallantry in 1943 for delivering a message from a downed aircrew.[1] His medal was sold for 4,830 ($7,313) in July 2000. Tyke was hatched in Cairo, Egypt, from British and South African parents, and was seconded into military service.[2] Bomber crews would carry homing pigeons in order to get word of their location back to home base should they be shot down.[3] In June 1943 the American bomber he was stationed on was shot down,[4] and Tyke was released in order to get help. He flew over a hundred miles in poor visibility, passing on the crew's call for help to friendly forces.[3] The bomber crew credited the pigeon with saving their lives.[2] Tyke was awarded the Dickin Medal for his actions, an animal-only medal issued by the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals. Tyke's citation reads, "For delivering a message under exceptionally difficult conditions and so contributing to the rescue of an Air Crew, while serving with the RAF in the Mediterranean in June, 1943."[1] He was one of the first pigeons to be awarded the Dickin Medal, along with White Vision and Winkie, who each received the award on 2 December 1943.[1] In July 2000, Tyke's Dickin Medal was auctioned by Spink Auction House in London. It was sold for the sum of 4,830 ($7,313) after receiving an initial top estimate of 3,500 ($5,299).[2] Fellow Dickin medallist Peter's medal was auctioned at the same event.[5]
