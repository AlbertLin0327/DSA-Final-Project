CKO/CFOX was an English language Canadian AM radio station located in Pointe-Claire, Quebec from 1960 to 1989. The station's callsign was CFOX from 1960 to 1977 and it later operated as CKO, the Montreal station of the news network of the same name, from 1977 until 1989. With studios based at 203 Hymus Blvd. in Pointe-Claire, the station went on air on March 15, 1960 as CFOX with an adult contemporary format with 1,000 watts of power, but was changed on February 5, 1963 to 10,000 watts. In 1964 the station format changed to country, and in 1965 to a Top 40 station. The station was originally operated by Lakeshore Broadcasting, which was owned by noted Montreal radio journalist Gord Sinclair Jr. (the son of Toronto radio/TV journalist Gordon Sinclair). It was sold to Allan Slaight in 1972, and he converted it to a country format. In 1975, the station went back to a Top 40 format until September 1977. Later that year it was purchased by the CKO news network, changing the call sign to CKO accordingly and converting it from Top 40 to an all-news format. The CFOX calls would later resurface in January 1979 at an FM station in Vancouver, British Columbia. CKO applied to convert from the AM dial to the FM dial to operate on the frequency 95.1MHz. That application was denied on March 19, 1987.[1] The 95.1MHz frequency will be later used by CBF-FM. On June 20, 1989, the CRTC approved an application by changing the frequency from 1470kHz to 650kHz. However, CKO's frequency change proposal was never implemented.[2] The station went off air when the network ceased broadcasting during a noon newscast in November 1989. The news was produced, but never aired. The broadcasting licences for the CKO network were returned to the CRTC in 1990. To this day the 650/1470 frequencies has not been reactivated in the Montreal area. Its transmitter site with three antennas in Chteauguay was demolished in 1992. CFOX is perhaps most famous for getting exclusive access to John Lennon and Yoko Ono's 1969 Bed-in for peace in room 1742 at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel, during which the song "Give Peace a Chance" was recorded.
