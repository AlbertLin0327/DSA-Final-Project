Bryan Keith Hitt (born January 5, 1954 in Center, Texas) is an American musician, best known as the drummer for the rock band REO Speedwagon. Hitt was born in Center, Texas. Coming from a large family, Bryan is the fifth of seven children; two sisters and four brothers. Bryan grew up in the nearby town of Joaquin, Texas (Kevin Cronin cites Beaumont, Texas as Bryan's hometown at concerts, as it is easier to pronounce/remember). At the age of fifteen, Bryan replaced the drummer in the band of his older brothers. This band was called the "The Solid Souls", and it exposed Bryan to soul music, the likes of James Brown, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, and Sam & Dave. It was about this time that his step-father's oil-industry career took the family along with Bryan to Alaska. Bryan with his passion for music and playing drums, joined several other bands throughout high school in Alaska. There were not many drummers in Alaska and Bryan got to do some recording, played with country bands, mariachi bands, rock, jazz, and funk bands. In 1972, Bryan graduated from East Anchorage High School. From that time to the age of twenty-six Bryan perfected his chops by playing in various groups in the Anchorage area. As his hard-hitting style develops, evolves, and comes into it's own, he is ready to take on the big-bad-exciting life of a professional rock and roll drummer. Setting up his kit, rockin' the locals, "hittin' 'em hard" for five to six hours a night, tearing down, and doing it again the next night; Bryan soon becomes a symbol of a hard working rock and roll drummer in the Anchorage music scene. Bryan recalls that his highlight in Alaska was opening for Ike and Tina Turner in the late 1970s. It is with this spirit that in 1980 Bryan makes the move from Anchorage to Los Angeles where "Glam-Rock" along the Sunset Strip was beginning to blossom, and talent was uncovered every night in the local clubs and hang-outs. Poofy hair and make-up of the 1980 glam scene was a change from what he'd been used to in Alaska, but this drummer who would one day be pounding out Roll With The Changes would embrace the change and was ready for the task at hand. Bryan was in the thick of it. With his talent and drive, he was exactly where he needed to be at the exact right moment in time. However, it would take a few years for Bryan to "Hitt" full stride. Throughout the early 1980s Bryan continued to play in different bands and continue to grow as a drummer. In February of 1985 Bryan met his wife Cindi at the West LA club: Madame Wong's West. Cindi was there to support a girlfriend who sang there frequently (Bryan wasn't performing that night). Bryan and Cindi were engaged three months later. According to Bryan, Cindi didn't see him perform on stage until nine months after they started dating. Bryan and Cindi were married in March of 1986. Cindi would provide the support Bryan needed as he continued to rise to become one of rock and roll's most established drummers. It was around this time in 1985 while in Los Angeles that Bryan got his first big break in his band Life by Night. Bryan also played in the bands Barrage and Ambush. Both Barrage and Ambush were Stan Bush projects, but's it is interesting to note that Bryan played in Ambush with Dave Amato who he would eventually play with in REO Speedwagon. Before there was MTV, VH1, and American Idol, the TV shows Solid Gold and American Bandstand showcased the best up and coming talent. Bryan provided the backbeat to various artists that would appear on these programs. With his passions for drumming and his easy going personality, Bryan also appeared on the TV series "Hunter," in which he is seen not so surprisingly playing drums in a rock band. In addition to these television appearances, he can be seen playing drums in a few different movies, including Karate Kid III, and Nothing But The Girl. Among Bryan's other accomplishments were spots playing with such artists as Cher, Graham Nash, and The Spencer Davis Group. He also recorded with Nick Gilder, Gary Busey, and Wang Chung. Bryan was constantly working and moving about. This would prepare him well as the drummer for REO Speedwagon; one of the hardest working and longest touring bands in the history of rock and roll. Times were not always rosy in the 1980's. Struggling a bit and in need of some cash, Bryan took a job at "The Drum Doctors." It did not pay much but Bryan was getting good exposure, making contacts and gaining experience. He did cartage and set ups for various drummers. One drummer included Jeff Porcaro. Jeff introduced Bryan to Peter Wolf, the producer and pianist for Frank Zappa and Lionel Ritchie. Wolf arranged for Bryan to do the Solid Gold TV show with Wang Chung. Peter had just finished producing Wang Chung's new record "Mosaic." Bryan would go on to play with Wang Chung for the next three years. In January of 1987 Bryan teamed with the London based "new wave" band Wang Chung to form a complete touring band. The band needed a dependable-durable-dedicated-determined-drummer to handle the upcoming tour plans and Bryan was more than up for the task. Wang Chung was the invention of vocalist and guitarist Jack Hues and bassist Nick Feldman. In the mid-eighties the band scored monster hits with the songs, Dance Hall Days, Everybody Have Fun Tonight, and Lets Go, with the latter two being both off the Mosaic album. In order to promote the Mosaic vinyl a touring band formed. The band included three musicians from the United States: Bryan on drums, Debra Dobkin on percussion, and Mikal Reid on guitar, along with UK saxophonist Martin Winning, and UK keyboards Graeme Pleeth. As the story goes: halfway through the tour, Graeme Pleeth had to leave the band. However, upon the recommendation of Bryan, the now late Jeff Naideau, a classically trained musician, New Orleans Jazz great, former "Life By Night" band member with Bryan , and friend of Bryan slipped in to finish out the second half of the successful tour which consisted of five February 1987 U.K. dates including a February 10 and 11th gig at the The Marquee in London. The band kicked off the U.S. part of the tour with a February 27, 1987 performance on the Johnny Carson Show. This "Tonight Show" appearance set the band off on there way to performing well over twenty successful U.S.and Canadian dates. Then, in late April 1987 the band returned to Britain for another month of touring. In June 1987 Wang Chung with Bryan performed in Montreux, Switzerland during the annual Montreux Rock Festival and International Music and Media Conference. Their performance was later broadcast on "MTV's Montreux Rock Festival Weekend" on June 20 and 21, 1987. While the band was on hiatus from touring, Bryan also played a few cuts on Wang Chung's last album, "Warmer Side of Cool". Wang Chung had just broken up, and Bryan was playing some dates with The Spencer Davis Group, a couple of showcase bands, and doing some sessions in L.A. Bryan was recommended by two different sources for the REO audition. Bryan had met Dave Amato, new REO guitarist at the time, at another audition and he suggested Bryan to the band. Bryan had also met lead singer Kevin Cronins girlfriend and future wife, Lisa, who worked for Giffen Records at a showcase with one of the other bands he was playing with. She wasn't too impressed with the band but was very complimentary about his playing and told him that REO was looking for a new drummer. Bryan was the first of about twenty-five drummers to audition. Kevin told Bryan after playing Roll With The Changes that the song felt better than it ever had before. Bryan got the gig, but out of professional courtesy, the band still listened to the remaining drummers over the next few days. A significant point to note is that Bryan brought his 1920's Ludwig Stipple Gold snare for the audition. Kevin Cronin was so impressed by the snare drum that when Bryan showed up to the first rehearsal without it, Kevin remarked that the band hired not only Bryan ... but the snare drum as well. Since late 1989, Bryan has toured, recorded, and provided the rock-n-roll beat of REO Speedwagon. His powerful style of drumming has propelled the band through its last three albums and countless tours. His established catch phrase "Hitt 'em Hard" is more than just a catchy slogan. Bryan really does play the drums hard. During the course of a touring year with REO he has been known to break at least 10 cymbals. In addition, every night at least 5 drumsticks will break or almost break in two. He has been known to ice his forearms after a hard night of playing. Bryan performs at drum clinics and also performed at the Chicago Drum Festival in 2011, and maintains a close friendship with his drum tech John Aldridge, who has been his tech since July 2005. He currently lives in Simi Valley, California with his wife Cindi (born Cindi Stephens on October 25, 1960), son Dakotah, and daughter Kayla Mackenzie "KK" Hitt (born 1999).  File:BHitt.jpg
