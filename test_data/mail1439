The discography of American recording artist Miley Cyrus consists of three studio albums, three live albums, two compilation albums, two remix albums, five soundtrack albums, one extended play (EP), eighteen singles, ten promotional singles, two video albums, and eleven music videos. Prior to launching a musical career of her own, Cyrus starred as the titular character on the popular television series Hannah Montana, which first aired in March 2006.[1] Consequently, the series became a franchise that released several soundtracks, where she performed under character. The first Hannah Montana soundtrack was released in 2006. It peaked at number one on the Billboard 200 for two consecutive weeks[2] and was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[3] Following the soundtrack's release, six songs debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 in the same week, making Cyrus the first act to do so; with seven tracks in total appearing on the chart, she also became the female act with the most songs charting in the one week.[4] Both records were later surpassed by Taylor Swift.[5] Cyrus then signed a record deal with Hollywood Records to launch a career under her own name. In 2007, the singer released the double-disc album Hannah Montana 2/Meet Miley Cyrus. The first disc, Hannah Montana 2, of the album was Hannah Montana's second season soundtrack, while the second disc, Meet Miley Cyrus, was Cyrus' debut studio album.[6] The album was also a success, peaking at number one on the Billboard 200[7] and being certified triple platinum by the RIAA.[3] Meet Miley Cyrus spawned two singles; the first, "See You Again" (2007) became her first top ten hit in the United States.[8] Cyrus released her second studio album, Breakout, in 2008. The album also peaked at number one[7] and was certified platinum by the RIAA.[3] Breakout encountered commercial success internationally, introducing Cyrus in new countries. The album produced three singles; one of them was the Rock Mafia remixed re-release of "See You Again". In 2009, Cyrus released the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack, which peaked at number one on the Billboard 200[2] and made Cyrus, sixteen years of age at the time, the youngest artist to have four number one albums on the chart.[9] The soundtrack produced her second best-selling single, "The Climb" (2009), which peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100[8] and led Cyrus to crossover to the country music industry. Selling over 3.1 million copies, the track became the fourth best-selling country single of the era.[10] Later in 2009, the Hannah Montana 3 soundtrack and the EP The Time of Our Lives followed, both of which peaked at number two on the Billboard 200.[7][11] The latter was certified platinum by the RIAA[3] and spawned her best-selling single, "Party in the U.S.A." (2009), which sold over 4.5 million copies,[12] making Cyrus the youngest artist to have a single that sold more than four million downloads.[13] Therefore, the song became one of the best-selling singles in the United States[14][15] and Hollywood Records' fastest and best-selling single to date.[16][17] Because of the success she enjoyed on Billboard charts during the year, Cyrus was ranked fifth on "Artists of the Year".[18] The singer later met with a decline in sales in 2010, with both her third studio album, Can't Be Tamed, and the final Hannah Montana soundtrack, Hannah Montana Forever, being unable to duplicate her prior success. As of April 2010, Cyrus has sold over 13.2 million albums in the United States[19] and, as of June 2010, nearly 20 million worldwide.[20]
