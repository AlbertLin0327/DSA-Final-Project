The tiompn (Irish) or tiompan (Scottish Gaelic) was a stringed musical instrument[1] used by the Gaelic musicians of Ireland and Scotland and probably therefore the Isle of Man. The word 'timpn' was of both masculine and feminine gender in classical Irish. It is theorised to derived from the Latin word 'tympanum' (tambourine or kettle drum) and 'timpn' does appear to be used in certain ancient texts to describe a drum. The adjective 'timpnach' referred to a performer on the instrument but is also recorded in one instance in the Dnta Grdha as describing a cruit. The feminine noun 'timpnacht' referred to the art or practice of playing the tiompn. In modern Irish traditional music, the word tiompan was used by the late Derek Bell, after Galpin's theories, to refer to the hammered dulcimer.
