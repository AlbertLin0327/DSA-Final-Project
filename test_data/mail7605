Sonja Richter (born 4 January 1974) is a Danish actress. She is probably the best known for her performance in 2002 film Open Hearts by Susanne Bier, for which she was nominated for Bodil Award and Robert Award. In a career which has thus far avoided Hollywood to focus on films in her native Denmark, she has also starred in Stealing Rembrandt (2003) and Villa Paranoia (2004), along with several other films and a significant amount of work in television. In 2004, at the 54th Berlin International Film Festival, Richter was one of ten young European actors that were presented Shooting Stars Award by the European Film Promotion. Richter studied acting at Odense Theatre's Acting School, graduating in 1999.[1]
