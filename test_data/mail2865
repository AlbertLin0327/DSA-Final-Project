Anubis Gate is a progressive metal band from Denmark. Despite having formed Anubis Gate only in 2003, the members regularly worked together since 1984. They have released five studio albums. Despite two departures since the band's creation, all current members are original members. Anubis Gate released their first album in 2004, but their history can be traced back to 1984, with bassist Jesper M. Jensen and Henrik Fevre as guitarist and vocalist forming V-AXE. The group changed their name to Graff Spee. Gaining some reputation in the local circles, Graff Spee released a few demos, but eventually split up in 1986 "due to creative differences".[1] Jensen then went on to form a number of different metal acts. Heavy metal band Extreme Feedback was formed in 1987, recruiting Morten Srensen as vocalist and Kim Olesen as guitarist. In 1989, Jensen went on to form thrash metal band Invocator, releasing a couple of demos and also a full length album "Excursion Demise" in 1991. In the early 90's Jesper joined Srensen in rap-metal act Geronimo, and released a EP in 1995 before the group was disbanded. These two musicians kept in contact however, and began to write new material together in a melodic progressive metal style.[2] After releasing a demo, more band members were recruited for a full album. Torben Askholm (previously in Prophets Of Doom and Northern Empire) joined as vocalist. "Purification" was produced during 2003 and released in 2004. The album aroused a great deal of interest and delight with the press and the audience, and both Kim Olesen and Henrik Fevre (who had guested on their debut) were made permanent members to solidify the line-up for the next album. "A Perfect Forever" was released on September 19, 2005.[2] Later that year Askholm quit the band and Jacob Hansen was chosen to replace him as the vocalist. "Andromeda Unchained", their 3rd album, came out in 2007.[3] The year 2008 saw Anubis Gate writing their newest work. Their album "The Detached" was released later and it was nominated for three Danish Metal Awards (Best album, Best cover artwork and best production) at the show of 2010. It won for Best Production - made by Kim Olesen & Jacob Hansen. It also marked the end of Anubis Gates obligations with label Locomotive Music. Several other companies showed interest as the band in 2010 embarked on writing material for their fifth album, which was scheduled for release in the spring 2011. In fact most of the songs were already finished when lead singer and producer Jacob Hansen announced his surprising departure from the band. Luckily Anubis Gate had a replacement within the band; bassplayer Henrik Fevre, who had previously done liveshows after Askholm, and who did backing vocals and the occasional lead on recent albums. Demos of the new material, produced by Kim Olesen secured the band a record deal in March 2011 with Minnesota-based Nightmare Records for a fifth album release in the fall of 2011 Musically, several groups like Queensryche, Iron Maiden, Lord Bane, Tad Morose, Iced Earth, Crimson Glory, Fates Warning, King Crimson, Genesis and Savatage were once credited by the record label Locomotive as influential sources of inspiration for Anubis Gate.[2] Studio albums
