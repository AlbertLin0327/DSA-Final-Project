Angus Scrimm (born August 19, 1926) is an American actor and Grammy-winning author, best known for playing the Tall Man in the 1979 horror movie Phantasm and its sequels.[1] Scrimm was born in Kansas City, Kansas. He was originally a journalist and has written and edited for TV Guide, Cinema Magazine, the Los Angeles Herald Examiner and many other publications. He has also written liner notes for many LPs and CDs for artists ranging from Frank Sinatra to the Beatles, as well as Arthur Rubinstein and Itzhak Perlman.[2] Scrimm won a Grammy (as Rory Guy) for his liner notes.[3] Scrimm stands approximately 6ft 4 in (1.93 m). To appear even taller when playing the Tall Man, he wore suits that were several sizes too small, and platform shoes. His Phantasm role led to a steady acting career in theater and television. In recent years Scrimm had a recurring role as an SD-6 agent on Alias.[3] http://totalscifionline.com/interviews/861-angus-scrimm-talking-tall
