The Ickey Shuffle was a touchdown celebration done by former National Football League fullback Elbert "Ickey" Woods of the Cincinnati Bengals after he would score a touchdown. Woods would shuffle his feet to the right and hold the football out to the right, shuffle his feet to the left and hold the football out to the left, and finally finish by doing three hops to the right and spiking the football into the ground.[1] This is largely considered[by whom?] by many to be the most famous touchdown dance in NFL history. The dance was in danger of being prohibited by NFL rules concerning planned celebrations, but after investigation, was not banned.[2] NASCAR driver Darrell Waltrip famously performed the Ickey Shuffle in victory lane after winning the 1989 Daytona 500.
