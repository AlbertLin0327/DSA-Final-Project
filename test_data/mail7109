State Route 143 marker Ohio highways Interstates U.S. Routes State Routes State Route 143 (SR 143, OH 143) is a northsouth state highway in the southern portion of the U.S. state of Ohio. The southern terminus of State Route 143 is at a T-intersection with the duplex of State Route 7 and State Route 124 approximately 1 mile (1.6km) west of the village of Pomeroy. Its northern terminus is at a T-intersection with U.S. Route 50 nearly 2.75 miles (4.43km) southwest of Albany. Along its way, State Route 143 passes through the western half of Meigs County and ducks into the extreme southwestern portion of Athens County. There is no portion of this state highway that is included within the National Highway System, a network of routes deemed most important for the country's economy, mobility and defense.[4] The debut of the State Route 143 designation took place in 1923. Originally, this highway started in downtown Middleport at the intersection of 2nd Avenue, the former routing of State Route 7, and Mill Street. It followed Mill Street to the northwest, which becomes known as Bradbury Road once it leaves the village. State Route 143 continued on Bradbury Road to its intersection with State Route 124, then turned east onto the current alignment of State Route 124. It proceeded east to the State Route 7 intersection, then turned north onto what is presently the duplex of State Route 7 and State Route 124 to the current southern terminus of State Route 143. It then followed the entirety of its current alignment, coming to an end at the predecessor to U.S. Route 50, State Route 26.[1][2] By 1969, in conjunction with the completion of a new State Route 7 bypass of Middleport and Pomeroy, the State Route 143 designation was removed from the portions located to the south of its current southern terminus, thus resulting in the highway taking on the shape it has today. Jurisdiction of the portion of State Route 143 along Mill Street in Middleport was turned over to the county, while control of the Bradbury Road section was transferred to Meigs County. The eastwest concurrent segment with State Route 124 became just State Route 124, while the northsouth concurrent stretch with State Route 124 turned into a duplex of State Route 7 and State Route 124.[5][6]
