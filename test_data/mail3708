Moving Forward is the second studio album by former New York Yankees outfielder turned jazz musician, Bernie Williams. The album was released on April 14, 2009 through the independent label, Reform Records. Williams, who played lead and rhythm, composed nine of the fourteen tracks on the album. Several well-known guests are featured on the album, including Bruce Springsteen, Dave Koz, and fellow athlete turned musician Wayman Tisdale. Moving Forward made it on to five different Billboard charts, including 178 on the magazine's main chart, the Billboard 200, but it found its greatest success on the Top Contemporary Jazz chart, where it peaked at #2. In addition to the album, two singles also made it to the Billboard's Smooth Jazz Songs. "Go For It" made it to #1, while "Ritmo De Otono" peaked at #2.[1] At the Latin Grammy Awards of 2009, Moving Forward was nominated for the Best Latin Jazz Album, it was beaten by Bebo Valds y Chucho Valds' Juntos Para Siempre. The album was met with positive reviews. Allmusic gave the album four out of a possible five stars, stating "while the four-time World Series champ's glory days are behind him as a ballplayer, he's Moving Forward towards a stellar career in music."[3] Dave Sheinin from The Washington Post also gave the album a favorable review stating that "if you can deal with some clichd jazz-fusion production, there are some interesting songs, some virtuoso flourishes (many of them from Williams, whose talent as a guitarist is evident) and some cool moments".[4]
