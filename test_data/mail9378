The Pescopagano massacre (Italian:Strage di Pescopagano) was a massacre perpetrated by the La Torre clan on April 24, 1990 in front of a bar in Pescopagano, in the municipality of Mondragone, located in the province of Caserta. The massacre resulted in the accidental deaths of five people, that included three Tanzanians, an Iranian, and an Italian. In addition to this, seven people were injured, including the bar manager and his fourteen year old son, who became paralyzed after suffering from a broken vertebrae. The bloodbath was the result of an internal conflict between the native Camorra, the La Torre clan that had run and controlled the whole municipality and it's rackets for years and the new Tanzanian and Ghanaian immigrants, under a new drug cartel that operated from Middle Eastern countries and Africa and planned to act in Italy.[1]
