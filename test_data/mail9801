Chris Smylie (born 22 March 1982 in Auckland) is a New Zealand rugby union player, who plays at halfback. Although he made his provincial debut for North Harbour in 2002, he currently plays for Otago in the NPC and the Highlanders in Super Rugby, and has been named in the New Zealand Mori squad for 2006.[1] Smylie was named NPC Division One Player of the Year for 2005, after a strong campaign which saw Otago finish runners-up behind Auckland.[2] Despite this, he was not the first choice starting halfback for the Highlanders in 2006, with Southland halfback Jimmy Cowan often being preferred. In the 2007 Super 14 season he was drafted into the Hurricanes where he was sharing the halfback role with Alby Mathewson until Piri Weepu came back from the All Blacks protected squad. In 2007 (For the 2008 Season) he was not selected for any Super 14 team, but of note has transferred to North Harbour.
