The 2008 Central Michigan Chippewas football team represented Central Michigan University in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) college football during the 2008 season. Central Michigan competed as a member of the West Division of the Mid-American Conference (MAC). The Chippewas were led by second-year head coach Butch Jones. Central Michigan finished the regular season with an 84 overall record and 62 in conference play, which was good enough for second place in the MAC West. The team received a bid to the 2008 Motor City Bowl,[1] where they faced the Florida Atlantic Owls led by head coach Howard Schnellenberger. The two teams were tied throughout the third quarter until the Owls pulled away. Central Michigan quarterback Dan LeFevour led a touchdown drive in the final three minutes, but an onside kick attempt failed, and the Chippewas lost, 2421.[2]
