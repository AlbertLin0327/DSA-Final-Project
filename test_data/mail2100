The 1972 Minnesota Twins finished 77-77, third in the American League West. After a slow start, manager Bill Rigney was replaced by Frank Quilici. 797,901 fans attended Twins games, the seventh highest total in the American League. It was almost half the number of fans that had attended just a few seasons earlier. Only one Twins made the All-Star Game: second baseman Rod Carew. Carew won his second AL batting title with a .318 average. Bobby Darwin showed potential as a hitter with 22 HR and 80 RBI, but that did not make up for age and injuries taking their toll on other players. Harmon Killebrew hit 26 HR (4th in the league) but drove in only 75 runs. Tony Oliva's bad knees limited him to only 10 games. Csar Tovar led the team with 86 runs scored. Four pitchers had double digit wins: Bert Blyleven (17-17), Dick Woodson (14-14), Jim Perry (13-16), and Jim Kaat (10-2). Kaat also won his 11th Gold Glove Award.
