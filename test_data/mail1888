Stranmillis College, Belfast; Northern Ireland Police Stations; Thomas Francis O. Rippingham[1][2](c. 1896  17 December 1964) was an English-born architect who spent most of his professional life in United Kingdom government service in Northern Ireland. Thomas Francis Rippingham worked on many projects and designs which have become part of the Northern Ireland landscape. One of his most characteristic and well known designs was that for the Police Stations which were built throughout Northern Ireland in the years following the Partition of the island of Ireland, in 1921, into the newly independent Republic of Ireland, and Northern Ireland itself, which remained a part of the United Kingdom.
