Content:
Interchondral Articulations (articulations of the cartilages of the ribs with each other).The contiguous borders of the sixth, seventh, and eighth, and sometimes those of the ninth and tenth, costal cartilages articulate with each other by small, smooth, oblong facets. Each articulation is enclosed in a thin articular capsule, lined by synovial membrane and strengthened laterally and medially by ligamentous fibers (interchondral ligaments) which pass from one cartilage to the other. Sometimes the fifth costal cartilages, more rarely the ninth and tenth, articulate by their lower borders with the adjoining cartilages by small oval facets; more frequently the connection is by a few ligamentous fibers. This article was originally based on an entry from a public domain edition of Gray's Anatomy. As such, some of the information contained within it may be outdated. median: Cruciate ligament of atlas (Transverse ligament of atlas) Alar ligament Apical ligament of dens Tectorial membrane of atlanto-axial joint lateral: no ligaments anterior sacroiliac ligament posterior sacroiliac ligament interosseous sacroiliac ligament ligaments connecting the sacrum and ischium: sacrotuberous ligament sacrospinous ligament M: JNT anat(h/c, u, t, l)/phys noco(arth/defr/back/soft)/cong, sysi/epon, injr proc, drug(M01C, M4)
