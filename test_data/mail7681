M. A. Hannan (Bengali:   ), or Abdul Hannan, is cited by many as the first person to read over radio the Bangladeshi declaration of independence, written by the leader of (as Bangladesh was formerly known) East Pakistan and Chief of Awami League Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from the Kalurghat Betar Kendra, Chittagong on March 26, 1971.[1] During the rule of the Awami League government (19962001), Chittagong Airport was named M. A. Hannan International Airport. However, the airport has been renamed as Shah Amanat International Airport after the Bangladesh Nationalist Party led alliance came to power in 2002.
