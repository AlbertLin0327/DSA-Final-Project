Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (Abbreviation: UTP; English: PETRONAS University of Technology) was established on 10 January 1997 when PETRONAS was invited by the Government of Malaysia to set up a university. The university was formerly known as Institute of Technology PETRONAS (ITP) and was a wholly owned subsidiary of PETRONAS, the national oil company of Malaysia. It was registered with the Ministry of Higher Education on 26 April 1995 and obtained approval under the "Essential Higher Education Institute Regulation 1996". ITP began its operations at PERMATA, Bangi, Selangor on 3 July 1995. On 26 July 1995, ITP was registered as a private limited company and transferred its operations to Tronoh in the state of Perak, on 1 July 1996. Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP) was established on 10 January 1997 when PETRONAS was invited by the Malaysian government to set up a university. The campus is built on a 4 square kilometres (990acres) site strategically located at Bandar Seri Iskandar, Tronoh, Perak, Malaysia. When UTP firstly moved to Tronoh, it took over the campus of Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM)'s engineering faculty, which has since moved to their new campus in Penang. In its initial years, lectures, lab sessions and tutorials were held in the old USM facilities, and UTP gradually shifted all operations to newer facilities once construction was completed.  The new academic complex was designed by Foster and Partners, and the first-phase construction was completed in 2004. The design received an Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2007. The overall layout of the new academic complex is in the shape of a five-pointed star made up by five semicircles. The new academic complex was officially opened by the former chairman of Petronas and ITPSB Board, Y. Bhg. Tan Sri Azizan Zainul Abidin. Currently, almost all of the academic activities have been shifted to the new campus. The front-most point of the star where the new academic complex is facing is the elliptical chancellor complex. The chancellor complex houses the chancellor hall, the information resource center, security department, finance department and some of the other important administrative department offices. It is affectionately dubbed the "glass" by the students due to its futuristic design. Another two points of the new academic complex is where the buildings commonly known as Pocket C and Pocket D is situated. Pocket C is an orange building with a slanting foyer look. Cafeteria, clinic, bookshop, prayer rooms and security office are located at the ground floor of the building. The first and second floor of the building consist of 2 computer-aided design theatres and 4 lecture theaters. Pocket D is a blue building with the same architectural design as Pocket C. The ground floor of the building is where cafeteria, the UTP Gallery, and the Student Card Centre are located. The first floor and second floor are seated by 6 lecture theaters. The Student Support and Services Department (SSSD) and prayer rooms are located at the third floor of the building. As for Pocket A and Pocket B, they were another two additional buildings in the initial new academic complex blueprint design. It is not known exactly why the buildings are not constructed. Along the perimeter of each semicircle, there are several buildings at the outer of the new academic complex. Each building is assigned to a programme. Some programmes has several buildings. The buildings are named with numbers. On the way from the chancellor complex to Pocket D, the buildings are Building 23, Building 22, Building 21 and Building 20. From Pocket D to Pocket C, the buildings are Building 19 up to Building 15. From Pocket C to Pocket B that is yet to be built, only Building 14 and Building 13 are available and are in use now. From the chancellor complex to the not-yet-built Pocket A, there are Building 1 up to Building 5. The numbered buildings are generally similar in design. The ground, first and second floor of the buildings consists of laboratories and discussion rooms. The third floor of the buildings is always the lecturers' offices. The university has a centralized sport facilities, commonly known as the sports complex. It is located near the main entrance gate. It consists of a swimming pool, several football fields, three futsal courts, three takraw courts, five basketball courts, five tennis courts, three volleyball courts, four squash courts, three badminton courts, a jogging track and a netball court. In general, students participate actively in sports, with the most popular sports being football and volleyball. All hostels in UTP are provided with network sockets with Local Area Network (LAN) and broadband Internet access through a central server maintained by the Information Technology and Media Services (ITMS) Department Nonetheless, there have been many complaints regarding the Internet access recently. It has been slow and unstable. In some cases, Internet access is lost completely. Beginning 1 February 2007, wireless Internet access is provided to UTP students at most of the places inside the campus and residential complex. As of April 2009, the internet bandwidth has been upgraded to 155 Mbit/s. However, wireless Internet connections have recently been discontinued at student hostels. Hence, students who need access to wireless connection often have to go to the IRC or nearby cafeterias. The internet network is also accessible in computer labs in each of the academic building in the Chancellor Complex. The foundation programmes are offered for students that enrol to UTP with SPM level or other equivalent levels to prepare them for degree programmes. Newly enrolled students with STPM level or other equivalent levels are exempted from the foundation programmes. Other newly enrolled diploma graduates are exempted from certain courses according to their academic performance and courses taken during their diploma programmes. Currently, UTP offers two foundation programmes, five bachelor engineering degree programmes and three bachelor technology degree programmes. In UTP, there are two semesters a year. A semester starts in January or July, with 14 weeks of studies per semester, divided by a one-week mid-semester break and ends with 3 weeks of final examination. The end of the semester is followed by a 7-week semester break. A trimester system has been implemented in foundation programmes since 2009. The foundation programmes offered in UTP are engineering foundation programme and technology foundation programme. As the names suggest, the engineering foundation programme prepares the students to continue with engineering degree programmes in UTP, whereas the technology foundation programme is a preparation programme for students to pursue their studies in technology degree programmes. The engineering degree programmes take a total of four years to complete (including internship), while technology degree programmes take three and a half years. All engineering students are welcomed to enrol in Management minor starting academic year of 2009. The seven degree programmes offered are: UTP also offers postgraduate degree programmes by research, and by coursework and dissertation. The programmes offered by research are: The Master of Science programmes offered by coursework and dissertation are: UTP offers one of the longest industrial internship programmes in the country. The students are posted as interns for 28 weeks (approximately 7 months). The length of the internship duration allows students to engage in more significant work assignments and is widely thought as a major strength of the academic curriculum.

They are from Egypt, United States of America, Belgium, France, India, Indonesia, Iran, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Philippines, Sudan, Russia, Turkey and Turkmenistan. There are several clubs and societies inside the campus. The main student organization of UTP would be the MPPUTP (Majlis Perwakilan Pelajar UTP) or SRCUTP (Student Representative Council of UTP). The main objective of the organization is to represent the students in all aspects related, and this includes academic and career, welfare, entrepreneurship, promotion and publication, sports and recreation, public relations and so on. There is also a few international based clubs and societies such as SIFE and AIESEC in UTP. These clubs ensure a diverse and an equal platform for students from all nationality to interact with equal involvement. To the date of writing 2 journalism teams are working on the campus newsletters, namely Heart of Tronoh (HOT) and The Inspirer. Events are usually organised by clubs and societies, generally costing up to tens of thousands of ringgit. Coordinates: 42311N 1005847E / 4.38639N 100.97972E / 4.38639; 100.97972
