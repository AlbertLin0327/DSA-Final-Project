Eas Mor, Minginish is a waterfall on the Minginish peninsula of the island of Skye in Scotland.[1] It lies on the Huisgill Burn just north of the settlement of Talisker (which gives its name to Talisker whisky) in Glen Oraid. There is another unnamed waterfall higher up the valley underneath the heights of Beinn nan Dubh-locahn ("the hill of the black loch"). The name Eas Mor is from the Gaelic language and means simply "big waterfall". Coordinates: 571731N 62630W / 57.29189N 6.44162W / 57.29189; -6.44162
