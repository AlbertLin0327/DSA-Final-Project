Kampung Raja, also known as 'the king's village' is the northern gateway to Cameron Highlands from Simpang Pulai. It was founded in early 1980 due to a water dam project which was built on the site of the original village near Ringlet. As a result of that, the state government moved the affected residents into a well-planned new village with houses and basic needs as compensation. The village later was called Kampung Raja. It is the only village in Cameron Highlands which is well planned and organised. Coordinates: 434N 10124E / 4.567N 101.4E / 4.567; 101.4
