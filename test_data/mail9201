The IOF .315 Sporting Rifle is a civilian version of the British military Lee-Enfield rifle, chambered in the 8x50mmR Mannlicher cartridge rather than the .303 British military cartridge due to Indian gun control laws. The .315 Sporting Rifle is made by the Indian Ordnance Factory.[1], which manufactured Lee-Enfield rifles for the British colonial Indian Army and post-independence Indian forces. It has a box-type magazine which holds 5 rounds. The rifle uses a 8 mm cartridge based on the 8x50mmR Mannlicher but loaded with hunting-type bullets rather than military ones. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
