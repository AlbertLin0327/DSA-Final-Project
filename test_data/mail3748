It was founded in 1923 in ilina, Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia). Trains from railway stations ilina and Brno transported 1078 persons (including mainly Czechs and Slovaks, but also Hungarians, Ruthenians and other nationalities, and including both direct members and their families) to Kyrgizia. Its members made many products on the green meadow. The famous Slovak politician Alexander Dubek also participated in this cooperative as a boy.
