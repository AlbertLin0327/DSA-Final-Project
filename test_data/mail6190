Kelvin Pope, better known as The Mighty Duke (1932  January 14, 2009)[1] was a Trinidadian calypsonian. He was born in Point Fortin. Pope left a career working at Shell Oil to perform calypso music. In the 1950s, he played locally in his hometown, then began playing in San Fernando at the Southern Brigade Calypso Tent. In 1964 he relocated to Port of Spain and performed at the Original Young Brigade. He won the National Calypso Monarch title for four years straight (1968-71), and was noted for exploring ideas such as black consciousness and global politics in his lyrics.[1] Lord Nelson was one of many for whom he composed music. In 1987, his "Thunder" was awarded the National Road March prize.[2] Pope died on January 14, 2009 at 1:05 pm in Saint Clair, Trinidad and Tobago of myelofibrosis, which he had been battling for five years.
