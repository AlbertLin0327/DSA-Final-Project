Victor Regalado (born April 15, 1948)[1] is a Mexican professional golfer who played on the PGA Tour. Regalado was born and raised in Tijuana, Mexico. As an amateur, he played in tournaments in the San Diego, California area just across the border from his home. He turned professional in 1971.[1] Regalado has just over 30 top-10 finishes in PGA Tour events including two wins. His first win came at the 1974 Pleasant Valley Classic. His second win came at a tournament in which he enjoyed a great deal of career success: the Ed McMahon-Jaycees Quad Cities Open. He won there in 1978, after finishing runner-up the year before. He also finished runner-up in 1981 when he lost to Dave Barr on the eighth extra hole in a playoff. His best finish in a major is T-10 at the 1984 PGA Championship.[2] Regalado is the only native Mexican golfer to win on the PGA Tour.[3] He lives in San Diego. this list may be incomplete Amateur
