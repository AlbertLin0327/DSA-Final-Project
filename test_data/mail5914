Skagafjrur is a deep bay in northern Iceland. Skagafjrur is about 40 km long and 15 km wide, situated between Trllaskagi to the east and the Skagi Peninsula to the west. There are two municipalities in the area, Skagafjrur Municipality (approx. 4140 inhabitants) and Akrahreppur Municipality (approx. 210 inhabitants).[1] This is one of Iceland's most prosperous agricultural regions, with widespread dairy and sheep farming in addition to the horse breeding for which the district is famed. Skagafjrur is the only county in Iceland where horses outnumber people. It is a centre for agriculture, and some fisheries are also based in the settlements of Saurkrkur and Hofss. The people living in Skagafjrur have a reputation for choir singing, horsemanship, and gatherings. There are three islands in the bay: Mlmey, Drangey and Lundey.[2] [3] The bay is located in a drowned glacial valley which is continued southwards by a plain in which lies the delta of the Hrasvtn river. The main settlement of this valley is Varmahl. Coordinates: 6554N 1935W / 65.9N 19.583W / 65.9; -19.583
