Rheomys leander The aquatic rat, Ecuador fish-eating rat, or fish-eating rat (Anotomys leander) is a South American species of semiaquatic rodent in the family Cricetidae.[2] It is the only species in the genus Anotomys. It is endemic to Ecuador. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry lowland grassland and rivers. It is threatened by habitat loss. Its karyotype has been reported to have 2n = 92,[2] but this number apparently actually came from a specimen of Ichthyomys pittieri.[3] 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
