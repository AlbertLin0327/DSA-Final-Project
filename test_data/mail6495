It was patented in Japan by Sumitomo in 1972[1] and its medical use remains mostly confined to that country. Its muscle relaxant properties are approximately equivalent to those of diazepam - however, it has more powerful sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects and is around four times more potent by weight compared to diazepam. [2] It is longer acting than diazepam due to its long-acting active metabolites,[3] which contribute significantly to its effects.[4] Flutoprazepam is typically used for the treatment of severe insomnia and may also be used for treating stomach ulcers.[5] Abuse of benzodiazepines in Japan is extremely common, with flutoprazepam being one of the most commonly abused, along with the benzodiazepines of abuse nimetazepam, temazepam and triazolam. Flutoprazepam is currently a Schedule IV drug under the international Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971.[6][7]
