Letter cutting is a form of inscriptional architectural lettering closely related to monumental masonry and stone carving, often practiced by artists, sculptors and typeface designers. Rather than traditional stone carving, where images and symbols are the dominant features, in letter cutting it is the beauty of the stone carver's calligraphy that is the focus.[1] Notable practitioners include Eric Gill, Ralph Beyer and David Kindersley.
