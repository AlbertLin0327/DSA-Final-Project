Coordinates: 531431N 14204W / 53.242N 1.701W / 53.242; -1.701 Great Longstone with Little Longstone is one of two villages in the local government district of Derbyshire Dales in Derbyshire, England. A place called Longsdune was mentioned in the Domesday Book as belonging to Henry de Ferrers[1] and being worth thirty shillings; this is considered to be Great Longstone.[2] The church of St Giles, in Great Longstone, dates from the thirteenth century. A medieval cross lies in the churchyard, and the head of a cross is built into the wall of the vestry.[3] The manor house, Longstone Hall, has its origins in the following century, but was rebuilt in the mid 18th. That century was one of prosperity, with lead-mining and shoemaking. There are two public houses in the main village: The Crispin Inn, named after St Crispin, the patron saint of shoemakers, and The White Lion. The manors of Great and Little Longstone passed through many hands over the years. Walter Blount, Lord Mountjoy, was Lord of the Manor on his death in 1474, when the lordship passed to Robert Shakerley[4] and his wife Margaret, daughter and heiress of Roger Levett.[5] The two families' coats of arms adorn the church of St Giles. In subsequent years, Shakerley descendants sold the manor to the Countess of Shrewsbury[disambiguation needed].[6] A market cross lies on the village green.[3] Little Longstone is further west, with a manor house from the seventeenth century and still has its village stocks. To the north is Longstone Edge, a limestone ridge some 1,300 feet in height, on an upfolding of the Derbyshire limestone known as the Longstone Anticline. It has been, and is, intensively quarried for galena, fluorspar, barytes and, more controversially, limestone. Since Longstone Edge is a noted beauty spot and is within the Peak District National Park there is strong local pressure for quarrying to stop altogether. Some of the quarrying is strictly controlled by the Peak District National Park Authority, which has been conducting a lengthy legal battle to try to stop other quarries which are operating outside the authority's guidelines. Further north is the White Cliff, where the exposed limestone contains fossilised corals. There was a railway station, built by the Midland Railway in 1863, when it extended the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway towards Buxton. Originally known as "Longstone", in 1913 it was renamed "Great Longstone for Ashford" (Ashford in the Water). It closed in 1962, but the building, designed to match the nearby Thornbridge Hall, survives as a domestic residence, and the trackbed through the station is part of the 8.5 mile Monsal Trail, a walk and cycleway.
