Uhersk Hradit (Czech pronunciation:[ursk rac]; German: Ungarisch Hradisch, Hungarian: Magyarhradis) is a town in the Zln Region of the Czech Republic. It lies on the Morava river and is the seat of the Uhersk Hradit District. Uhersk Hradit was founded in 1257 by the Czech king Otakar II. The city is a center of Moravian Slovakia, a region known for its characteristic folklore, music, wine, costumes and traditions. The historic city center is historically preserved. For etymology of the name see Moravian Slovakia and Hungarian exonyms. Uhersk Hradit is located in the southeast of the Czech republic close to the border with Slovakia in the historical land of Moravia. The region is attractive owing to its landscape and rarities. The Morava river with its alluvial forest as well as flora and fauna are particularly popular and the Chiby and White Carpathians mountain ranges are also in close proximity to the city. The area has several castles and palaces, the Great Moravian town Star Msto, and the pilgrimage spot Velehrad. Uhersk Hradit is also known for its film festival named Summer Film School (Letn filmov kola).
