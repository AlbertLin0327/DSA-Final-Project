The Quesnel River is a major tributary of the Fraser River in the Cariboo District of central British Columbia.[3] It begins at the outflow of Quesnel Lake, at the town of Likely and flows for about 100 kilometres (60mi) northwest to its confluence with the Fraser at the city of Quesnel. Just downstream from the outlet of Quesnel Lake, at the confluence of the Cariboo River, is the historically important ghost town of Quesnel Forks, aka "the Forks", which was a junction point of the Quesnel and Cariboo Rivers. Various trails and wagon roads leading to the Cariboo goldfields lay across the low-hill range north of Quesnel Forks in the basin of the Cottonwood River. Both the Lillooet to Fort Alexandria wagon road and the later Cariboo Wagon Road came by Quesnel Forks but preferred to follow the valley of the Quesnel River to Quesnel and then east from there to the gold towns of Barkerville and Wells. The river took its name from Jules-Maurice Quesnel, who explored this region with Simon Fraser in the early 19th century.
