The club are founding and continuing full members of the Scottish Rugby Union and play home games in the picturesqe setting of Kings Park, Dalkeith. The club will be playing in Edinburgh League Div 2 for season 2007-08. The club fields two senior XVs and a Colts XV and has a thriving youth section, with teams from primary 3 age to under 15. The youth section has a fine pedigree, producing several Edinburgh age group players and three Scotland u/18 caps over the last 10-years. The club has a long and proud history which began in 1898 with the first match being against Edinburgh Institution 2nd XV (now Stewart's Melville) on 14 October of that year. Dalkeith won 60pts - Nil with 6 tries being scored. Although there are no details of the team that played that day, there is still a team photograph from 1899 which hangs within the clubhouse recording the names of those who pioneered the game in the area at that time. Notable players during this year were Adam Robson (1949) who went on to play for Hawick and gain 22 caps for Scotland before coming president of the SRU and Brian Henderson who played for Edinburgh Wanderers and gained 12 Scottish Caps. The Diamond jubilee of the club was celebrated on 27 March 1958 in the Unicorn Inn. 6 members of the 1914 team were present including 2 original members from 1898 - D & I McLelland. The speakers were Adam Robson & David Toynbee. In the spring of 1959 the club moved to King's Park with the tennis pavilion being used as the changing rooms.
