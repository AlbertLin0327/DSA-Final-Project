Roger Lake (also called Rogers Lake or Rogers Pond) is a mountain pond located in a meadow on Aneroid Mountain in the Eagle Cap Wilderness of Northeastern Oregon, United States. It is situated one half mile from Aneroid Lake on trail 1804.[1] It is listed as the 29th highest lake in the Eagle Cap Wilderness[2] Roger Lake can be accessed by either the East Fork Wallowa River Trailhead at Wallowa Lake or the Tenderfoot Trailhead. The East Fork Wallowa River Trailhead is by far a shorter hike to Roger Lake, being only 5.5 miles long. After about two miles of hiking on the East Fork Wallowa River Trail, the climber will reach a small dam. At 3.8 miles there is a small, well built bridge. Depth of river is 9 m and max depth is 14 m. The trail is usually very well maintained.[3] It may be heavily traveled in the summer months.[4]
