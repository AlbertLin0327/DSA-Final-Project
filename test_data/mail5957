The Miss Ghana Pageant is an annual pageant organized by Media Whizz Kids to select Ghanas representative to the annual Miss World Pageant. It is the biggest and oldest national beauty pageant of Ghana. The contest was established in 1957, the year of Ghanas independence, with Monica Amekoafia becoming the first-ever Miss Ghana. Aside from Miss World, the pageant is also responsible for sending representatives to Miss ECOWAS/CEDEAO (not to be confused with the ECOWAS Peace pageant). The winner signs a one-year contract with the pageant organiser to become the spokesperson for their various charities. In addition, she chooses a specific cause to support for the year of her reign. The current Miss Ghana is Stephanie Karikari who won the title on 30 October 2010 in Ghanas capital city, Accra.  Ghana debuted at Miss World 1959 with Star Nyaniba Annan. However, there have been two candidates (1990 and 1991) who represented Ghana at Miss World, but were not Miss Ghana titleholders. There are also several years that Ghana did not send a representative to Miss World even though there was a titleholder.
