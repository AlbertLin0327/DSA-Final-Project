Jeppo (Finnish: Jepua) is a former municipality of Finland, now a village of Nykarleby.[1] The population is about 1,100; 82% of whom are Swedish-speaking.[2] KWH Mirka has a factory here that produces coated and non-woven abrasives.[3] The village is twinned with the Emmaboda Municipality, Sweden. The original settlement was known as Epu.[4] In 1548 there were 189 inhabitants including 26 farmers. The church was opened in 1861.[4] In 1970, 84.5% of inhabitants were Swedish-speaking and 15.4% Finnish-speaking, thus the former municipality was bilingual. That municipality merged into Nykarleby in 1975. Coordinates: 6324N 2237E / 63.4N 22.617E / 63.4; 22.617
