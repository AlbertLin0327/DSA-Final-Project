Abdullah al-Qasemi (Arabic:  ) (born in Buraydah in Saudi Arabia in 1907) was twentieth-century Arab writer and intellectual. He is famous for his conversion from fundamentalist Salafi Islam to atheism, and for his sceptical and secular writings. After surviving assassination attempts in Egypt and Lebanon[citation needed], he died of cancer in Ain-Shams Hospital in Cairo, Egypt in 1 September 1996. Abdullah Al-Qasemi's works have rarely been translated.
