Eld was  according to chronicler Anonymus  one of the seven chieftains of the Magyars (Hungarians), who led the Hungarians to the Carpathian Basin in 895. Eld was the chieftain of the Hungarian tribe of the Nyk. The Nyk tribe occupied the region around Lake Balaton, mainly the areas what are known today Zala and Somogy counties.[1] 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
