Little Washington is a now mostly uninhabited African American village in Loudoun County, Virginia. It is located south of Gleedsville off The Woods Road. Little Washington lies on a hill overlooking Gleedsville Cemetery where the community once consisted of several homes belonging to the Washington family. Little Washington was served by the Mountain Gap Colored School which remained standing until the 1980s when it burned down. Separately, and more commonly, Little Washington can also refer to the town of Washington, Virginia, the Rappahannock County seat, notable for the Inn at Little Washington. The Inn at Little Washington was visited by the Salahis on an episode of The Real Housewives of Washington, D.C..
