Professor Dr Karla Pollmann (1963) is a professor of Classics researching in the areas of Classical to Late Antiquity, patristics, the history of exegesis and hermeneutics, and the thought of Augustine of Hippo and its reception. She studied Classics, Divinity, and Education at the Universities of Tbingen, Munich, Cambridge, and Bochum, receiving her PhD in Classics from the Ruhr University Bochum in 1990. Pollmann began her career as an assistant professor first in Bielefeld (199091), then in Konstanz (199195), teaching Latin, and she spent some time on postdoctoral studies at University College London, funded by the prestigious Alexander von Humboldt Stipend (199395). In 1994, she finished her Habilitation at Konstanz, and she moved to the University of St Andrews to take up a post as a lecturer in Classics (19952000). In 2000, she was promoted to the rank of professor.[1] Pollmann is a visiting professor at many institutions throughout the world, including the University of Vienna, the University of British Columbia (Green College), Wolfson College Oxford, the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study, and the University of rhus, where she has been made an Adjunct Professor.[2] For 2011-2013, she has been elected as Professor Extraordinary at Stellenbosch University.[3] Pollmann is a College Peer Review Member of the Arts and Humanities Research Council and has served on various of its panels.[4] She is on the editorial or advisory board of several important journals and encyclopedias, including Societies, Oxford Journal of Reception Studies, Millennium, Journal of Ancient Christianity, Lexikon der Bibelhermeneutik, Augustiniana, Hypomnemata, and Thoemmes Dictionary of British Classicists: 1500-1960,[5] and is Editor-in-Chief of the international and interdisciplinary Oxford Guide to the Historical Reception of Augustine.[6] Pollmann works on ancient texts of Antiquity ranging from Homer to the early Christian writers. She is particularly interested in the interface between Classics and Theology, especially the reception of Classical thought and literature in Christian writers and the amalgamation and transformation of ideas from Classical and Late Antiquity. More recently she has become interested in the reception of early Christian thought in later times, and this interest led to her directing an international and interdisciplinary project funded by the Leverhulme Trust on the reception of Augustine of Hippo from his death in 430 to 2000.[7] K.
