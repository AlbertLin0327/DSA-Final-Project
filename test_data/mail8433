"Toronto's enterprising One Little Goat Theatre Company"[1] is North Americas only theatre company devoted to modern and contemporary poetic theatre.[2][3] Founded by poet, playwright and director Adam Seelig in New York in 2002, and based in Toronto since 2005, the company is distinguished by its highly interpretive, provocative approach to international plays. The company takes its name from the ancient Aramaic folk song (Chad Gadya) that traditionally concludes the Passover Seder. Producing, developing, defining and redefining poetic theatre has been One Little Goats mandate since the companys inception.[4] While the term is open to interpretation, One Little Goats Artistic Director, Adam Seelig, outlines key elements of the companys aesthetic in an essay for the Capilano Review entitled EMERGENSEE: GET HEAD OUT OF ASS: Charactor and Poetic Theatre.[5] These elements include "charactor" (Seeligs term for combining an actors onstage persona with their offstage nature), the "prism/gap" (between actor and audience), and ambiguity. The essay also traces the influences of Sophocles, Zeami, Luigi Pirandello, Bertolt Brecht, Samuel Beckett, Thomas Bernhard and others on One Little Goats dramatic approach. Poetic theatre attempts to find clarity through ambiguity. Its not verse theatre or prose theatre or journalistic theatre. Its theatre that treats the text as a score [...] and treats the gap between actor and audience not as an obstacle to bypass, but as a medium through which multiple meanings can emerge. Theres a difference between shining a light directly into the audiences eyes, and having it pass through a prism.[6] One Little Goats definition of poetic theatre is a work in progress and the companys artistry is practical before it is theoretical: doing the plays comes first; theory and definition follow.[7] Like the First Time, World Premiere, 28 October - 13 November 2011, Walmer Centre Theatre, Toronto Written and Directed by Adam Seelig With Elva Mai Hoover, Dov Mickelson, Andrew Moodie, Cathy Murphy, Jessica Salgueiro Sets & Costumes, Jackie Chau; Lighting Design, Laird MacDonald; Sound Design, Thomas Ryder Payne; Stage Manager, Christopher Whitlock; Wardrobe Assistant, Alison Ho Overview: Like the First Time revolves around Fulvia, a woman torn between her current life as a single woman and her past life as a wife and mother. On the one hand there is Marco, her latest lover, while on the other there's Silvio, her former husband, who wants to reclaim her as his wife and mother to their now-teenaged daughter. Complicating all this is the daughter's belief that her mother is long dead. Which direction Fulvia's life will take remains uncertain to the plays very end. Like the First Time is modelled on Nobel Prize Winner Luigi Pirandellos 1920 play, Come Prima Meglio di Prima (Like Before Better than Before). Adam Seelig has written Like the First Time without punctuation so that the actors may choose how they emphasize the text. The ample spacing on each page of the script is generated by the vertical alignments of certain words in order to create a circumscribed tonal universe for the dialogue. This marks the first time in the history of dramatic literature that a "drop poem" technique has been used to write an entire script. (Seelig first employed this technique for his poem/novella, Every Day in the Morning (slow).[8] Publication: Like the First Time is published by BookThug (Toronto 2011).[9] In the spirit of Charles L. Mee the full text is available freely online.[10] Ritter, Dene, Voss, New York Premiere, 23 September - 10 October 2010, La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club (Opening production of La MaMa's 49th season, the last one under the artistic leadership of founder Ellen Stewart) By Thomas Bernhard, Directed by Adam Seelig, Translated from the German by Kenneth Northcott and Peter Jansen[11] With Shannon Perreault, Maev Beaty and Jordan Pettle Sets & Costumes, Jackie Chau; Lighting Design, Kate McKay; Stage Manager, Sandi Becker; Music, Ludwig van Beethoven Overview: In Ritter, Dene, Voss (named for the three actors - Ilse Ritter,[12] Kirsten Dene[13] and Gert Voss[14] - who premiered the original 1986 production in German), Thomas Bernhard explores sexual repression and sibling rivalry with characteristic tenacity and wit. The play involves two sisters  both actresses  and their attempts at reintegrating their volatile brother into their home. The brother, a tormented genius (loosely based on last centurys great, idiosyncratic philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein), has just returned from a mental health institute, complicating the dynamics between the three siblings. Talking Masks (Oedipussy), World Premiere, 1328 November 2009, Walmer Centre Theatre, Toronto Written and Directed by Adam Seelig With Richard Harte, Jane Miller, Andrew Moodie, Cathy Murphy Sets & Costumes, Jackie Chau; Lighting Design, Laird MacDonald; Projections, Jason J Brown; Sound Design, Christopher Stanton; Stage Manager, Wendy Lee; Production Assistant, Ruthie Pytka-Jones Overview: Talking Masks (Oedipussy) involves a son, two mothers and an absent father who, in exploring the intertwined fates of their family, fuse two of the worlds most enduring myths: the tragedy of Oedipus, and the harrowing tale of half-brothers Isaac and Ishmael. What unfolds is a wild progression of rapid-fire interactions that expose as much as they mask about the charactors. Publication: Talking Masks is published by BookThug (Toronto 2009).[15] Someone is Going to Come, English Canadian Premiere, 1329 March 2009, Walmer Centre Theatre, Toronto By Jon Fosse, Directed by Adam Seelig, Translated from the Norwegian by Harry Lane and Adam Seelig With Michael Blake, Dwight McFee, Stacie Steadman Sets & Costumes, Jackie Chau; Lighting Design, Kate McKay; Stage Manager, Wendy Lee; Music, Ludwig van Beethoven Overview: Jon Fosse's provocative and primal three-person play involving sexual jealousy is featured in a new English translation by University of Guelph Professor Harry Lane, and One Little Goats Artistic Director, Adam Seelig. Someone is Going to Come involves a man and a woman who move to an old, run-down house in the middle of nowhere in order to be alone together. From the beginning, however, they grow anxious that someone is going to come. And sure enough, someone does come, someone whose presence unleashes hidden jealousies that threaten to shatter the couples relationship. This all unfolds through Fosses distinctively austere lyricism.
