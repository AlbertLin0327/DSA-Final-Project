Malvi (Malavi, Mallow, Malwada, Malwi) is the Rajasthani language of the Malva region of India, with ten million speakers. Nimadi, spoken in the Nimar region of Madhya Pradesh and in Rajasthan, is its closest relative. The dialects of Malvi are Ujjaini (Ujjain, Indore, Dewas, Shajapur, Sehore districts), Rajawadi (Ratlam, Mandsaur, Neemuch districts), Umathwadi (Rajgarh district), and Sondhwadi (Jhalawar district). Ujjaini is the prestige dialect, and the language as a whole sometimes goes by that name. About 75% of the Malvi population can converse in Hindi, which is the official language of the Madhya Pradesh state, and literacy rate in a second language such as Hindi is about 40%.There are many unpublished materials in this language.
