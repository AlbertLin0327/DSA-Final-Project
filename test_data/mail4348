Prem Singh Dhami was a Nepalese politician and minister, belonging to the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist). He was elected to the parliament in 1994. In April 1997 he was appointed by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to head a 'Working Committee for the Study of Maoist Activities and Finding Solutions', in order to counter the influence of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist).[1] The Committee was also known as the 'Dhami Commission'.[2]
