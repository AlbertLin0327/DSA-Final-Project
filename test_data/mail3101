The Surgery with Aled (formerly known as the Sunday Surgery) is a British radio show that airs on BBC Radio 1 on Sunday evenings from 9-10pm hosted by Aled Haydn Jones and every week a special guest.[1] The show first began with Sara Cox in 1999, then was joint-hosted by Emma B. Emma B and Dr. Mark Hamilton then co-hosted the show for six years, before Letita SD took over the programme until 2007. From July 2007, Annie Mac took over the role of presenting from Letitia during the Sex Weeks Of Summer a series of special programs during Radio 1's Six Weeks Of Summer focusing on sex related issues. The show was relaunched in October 2007 with Kelly Osbourne at the helm, but her stint was short lived. She was formally replaced by Aled Haydn Jones in March 2009. Listeners are given advice to problems in certain areas of their life, mostly for common adolescent problems, and other listeners share their experiences and advice and are encourage to give their point of view. The format is similar to "problem pages" found in teenage magazines. The Surgery often has show specifically dedicated to one subject, such as a type of addictive behaviour or dependency. The Surgery has a team of experts on hand to deal with both medical, emotional and psychological problems including medical doctors Mel Sayer, and Stuart Flanagan and psychotherapist Dr. Aaron Balick. Four television programmes were made for the Open University about common themes often discussed about sexual health. In October 2005, the programme toured four universities, broadcasting live from the student union bars. In September 2005, they went on a Sex Tour discussing sexual health to Yale College in Wrexham.
