The Sierra Network's (later the Imagination Network) game Paintball (and later Paintball 2) was a team game that took place on field of a small number of screens representing a forest with various obstacles and barriers. The game's appearance online occurred around the time that paintball was becoming popular in the United States. At the start of each game the Red and Blue teams would be separated into groups. Before the beginning of the game each side could place their team members in hidden or strategic positions. The positions were often ones that could be difficult to fire back on or gave an especially good advantage to hit enemy players. The strategies involved resemble a very early method of learning and exploiting a "map" that is common place in online competitive gaming today.
