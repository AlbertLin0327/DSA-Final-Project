The Division of Forde is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. The division was created in 1984 and is named for Frank Forde, who was briefly Prime Minister of Australia in 1945. When it was created it was a marginal seat in the southern suburbs of Brisbane, but it now has no territory in common with the original seat and is located in semi-rural areas south of the city, including Beenleigh, Beaudesert, Boonah and Loganlea. It was a fairly safe seat for the Liberal Party after the 2004 election. Kay Elson announced that she would not re-contest her seat in the 2007 Australian Federal election. Wendy Creighton, a Boonah resident and editor of the local newspaper, the Fassifern Guardian, contested Forde as the Liberal candidate instead. She was defeated at the Federal election by Brett Raguse, the opposing Labor Party candidate, making Forde the safest Liberal Party seat to be claimed by the Labor Party at the 2007 election.
