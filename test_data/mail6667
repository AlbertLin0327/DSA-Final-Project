Repnje is a village in the Municipality of Vodice in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia.[2] In the centre of the village is Repnje Castle, built in the late 19th century and now housing a Franciscan convent with an adjacent church.[3] The main church of the settlement is built on a hill above the village. It is dedicated to Saint Giles and a portion of its defense wall, built against Ottoman raids, still survives today.[4] The Slovene linguist Jernej Kopitar was born in Repnje.
