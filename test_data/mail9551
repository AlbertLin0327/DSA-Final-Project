Pool is an album by John Zorn featuring his early "game piece" composition of the same name. The album, first released on vinyl on Parachute Records in 1980, and later released on CD on Tzadik Records with an additional bonus track featuring a test recording of Archery as part of the The Parachute Years Box Set in 1997 and as a single CD in 2000.[1] The Allmusic review by Joclyn Layne awarded the album 3 stars stating "Dedicated fans should check this out, as it is part of the early annals of Zorn. Listeners with less patience for music theory -- and Zorn skeptics -- should save Pool for later, because it will not win anyone over; nor will the compositional theories become more clear upon listening. Essentially, Pool has more historical value than listening interest".[2]
