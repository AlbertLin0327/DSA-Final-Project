Those Awful Hats is a 1909 short comedy film directed by D.W. Griffith. It takes place in a small, crowded movie theatre, where the patrons are perpetually distracted by people - primarily women - wearing large, ostentatious hats that obstruct everyone else's views of the screen. The film ends with a title card reading, "Ladies Will Please Remove Their Hats." A print of the film survives in the film archive of the Library of Congress.[1]
