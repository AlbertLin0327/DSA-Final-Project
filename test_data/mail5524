The Christian Democratic Union (Latvian: Kristgi demokrtisk savienba, abbreviated KDS) is a minor Christian democratic political party in Latvia. It is currently led by Mra Viktorija Zilgalve. The KDS was founded in 1991. The party participated in the 1993 Saeima election and optained 5.0% of the vote and six seats. In the next parliamentary election in 1995 the party contested in alliance with the Latvian Farmers' Union and won 6.3% of the vote and eight seats. In 1998 it joined forces with the Labour Party and the Latvian Green Party, in 2002 with Latvia's First Party and in 2006 with the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party. In the 2010 legislative election it got just 0.36% of the votes and thus failed to overcome the 5% threshold.[1] The two European elections in 2004 and 2009 were unsuccessful (0.4% and 0.3% of the vote respectively).[2][3] The party's platform is based on Christian values. Economically the Christian Democratic Union advocates the elimination of corruption, lower taxes, free enterprise, the strengthening of agriculture and the improvement of infrastructure.[4] The party favours the model of a social market economy in the sense of Ludwig Erhard.[5]
