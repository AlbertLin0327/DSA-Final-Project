Duncan Chessell (born 1970 in Adelaide) is an Australian explorer, mountain guide, geologist and photographer who has reached the highest summits in each of the world's seven continents (Seven Summits)[1] . Duncan also owns and operates Duncan Chessell Expeditions (DCXP) who offer personalised trips to adventurous customers, focusing on trekking & climbing expeditions.[2] Duncan has been climbing since 1988, guiding since 1994 and has climbed and guided on all seven continents. He started out on the crags and in the gorges of National Parks of Australia, then moved on to larger mountains around the world. He is one of few Australian mountaineers to have climbed and guided Mt Everest and the equal first South Australian to summit. He has also guided Cho Oyu successfully twice.[3] He was also a member of the first Australian ascent of Makalu, the 5th highest peak in the world. In New Zealand he has climbed technically hard (grade six) routes and is one away summit from completing all the 3000m peaks in New Zealand.[citation needed] He has also climbed the fabled Seven Summits and is one of only about a dozen guides to have led expeditions to all of the Seven Summits.[3] He is a member of the NZMGA. He now spends much of his time managing DCXP and leading mountaineering group. In 2006 Duncan worked with a group of young people with cancer known as CanTeen, guiding them to climb Mt Kilimanjaro.[4]
