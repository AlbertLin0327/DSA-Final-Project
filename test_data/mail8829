The Lam Ta Klong is a river in Thailand. The Lam Ta Klong is a tributary of the Mun River. Its source lies within the Khao Yai National Park. The Lam Ta Klong joins the Mun River just east of Nakhon Ratchasima. The Lam Ta Klong has historically been of major significance to the rice-and-fish culture in the northeast Thailand.[1]
