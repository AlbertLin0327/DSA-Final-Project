YNN Austin is a 24-hour local cable news television channel based in Austin, Texas, owned by Time Warner Cable. Launched on September 13, 1999 as News 8 Austin[1] it is available only to subscribers of Time Warner Cable's Central Texas Division, which includes Austin, San Marcos, Round Rock, Temple, Killeen and Waco. News 8 changed its name to YNN (Your News Now) on January 10, 2011[2], matching the name of Time Warner's other cable news channels and following a gradual transition over the last several months. The channel operates on a wheel format, offering recorded blocks of news, features, and weather. During more limited times of the day it also provides traffic and sports segments. Producers update the wheel throughout the day, inserting new material as stories are filed and updated information becomes available. Weather segments air every 10 minutes "on the eights". The channel also provides nonstop "wall-to-wall" weather coverage during Tornado and Thunderstorm warnings. YNN's studios are located at 1708 Colorado Street in Austin, just north of the Capitol and immediately south of the main campus of the University of Texas. Without the traditional limitations faced by network affiliates, YNN is known in Austin for its coverage of community news and more restrained coverage of TV news staples such as crime and scandal. The channel is also distinct from traditional TV news operations in that its shows are traditionally hosted by a single anchor and in that its reporters occasionally set up, shoot and edit their own stories without the assistance of a video photographer. YNN also operates several other video and information services, including: Anchors Weather team Sports team Reporters Contributors  Texas Broadcast television areas by city: Abilene/Sweetwater Amarillo (Texas Panhandle) Austin Beaumont/Port Arthur Corpus Christi Dallas-Fort Worth Del Rio Eagle Pass El Paso Houston Laredo Lubbock Midland-Odessa (Permian Basin) Presidio Rio Grande Valley San Angelo San Antonio Sherman/Ada, OK Texarkana/Shreveport, LA  Tyler/Longview (East Texas) Victoria Waco/Bryan (Brazos Valley) Wichita Falls/Lawton, OK austin pearson is a weirdooo...LOL jks jks jks ILY xxx:P
