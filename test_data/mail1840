Aquarius Casino Resort (formerly known as the Flamingo Hilton Laughlin and Flamingo Laughlin) is a hotel and casino located in Laughlin, Nevada. The hotel is owned by American Casino & Entertainment Properties and is the largest hotel in Laughlin. Aquarius has two 18-floor towers with 1,907 rooms and suites that overlook the Colorado River. The casino, with an area of 57,000sqft (5,300m2), has more than 1,500 slot machines and nearly 60 table games, as well as a race and sports book. The property includes a business center, fitness center, pool, and tennis courts. The Aquarius also has a tour boat, the Celebration, which takes visitors on a tour of the Colorado River area of Laughlin. On August 1, 1990, the Aquarius opened as the Flamingo Hilton Laughlin. In late 2000, Hilton broke off with Bally Entertainment Corporation, and the hotel's name was changed to just the Flamingo Laughlin. On November 29, 2005, Harrah's Entertainment announced plans to sell the resort to American Real Estate Partners. The $170 million sale closed on May 19, 2006. Plans called for the property to be renamed the Aquarius within 6 months of the sale. The Flamingo Laughlin became the Aquarius Casino Resort in October 2006. On April 22, 2007, an agreement to purchase the Flamingo Laughlin was signed with Whitehall Street Real Estate Partners, a division of Goldman Sachs. The Aquarius features a 3,300-seat Aquarius Outdoor Amphitheater, and a smaller Aquarius Pavilion, which hosts numerous stage shows and musical reviews. Entertainment appears regularly in Splash Cabaret for free. Coordinates: 350949N 1143421W / 35.1635141N 114.5725188W / 35.1635141; -114.5725188
