Jammin' Java is a music club and coffee bar in Vienna, Virginia, which focuses on local and independent musical acts. The 200-seat venue has hosted eminent artists such as Nick Jonas, Paramore, Bon Iver and Ingrid Michaelson. It was founded in 1999, and in 2001 was bought and revamped by the Brindley brothers who currently own and run it. According to Pollstar, it has become a top-100 clubs in ticket sales in the world since its Brindley ownership.[1] It was also named one of the top 40 music clubs in America by Paste magazine.[2] The Jammin' Java brand was originally a collection Christian-themed and owned coffeehouses[3] started by The Sunrise Foundation. The Sunrise Foundation, created and funded by the Fairfax, Virginia, senior care provider Sunrise Assisted Living Inc., began a two-part plan to develop Maryland into a center for Christian music by first opening a 1,000-square-foot recording studio in 1996.[4] The studio, Waters Edge, was a non-profit studio available to Christian recording artists. The second part was to create a chain of Christian-run coffeehouses called "Jammin' Java" to host Christian artists.[4] In 1998, the first Jammin' Java was opened in Kent Island, Maryland.[5] Additional areas were scouted, including a partially DHCD-funded location in Washington, D.C. that never materialized.[6] In November 1999, the second Jammin' Java was opened in a strip mall in Vienna, Virginia. Located outside of Washington D.C., the former Rite Aid became a coffee shop, small music venue and recording studio, as well as a music store that sold guitars and amplifiers.[5] The venue mainly featured Contemporary Christian music and small acts but was described by the owner Matt Turner as being "faith-based and non-denominational" and did not feature Christian iconography.[5] The Vienna Jammin' Java lasted for two years before changing management and direction. The Waters Edge recording studio and Kent Island Jammin' Java would eventually close, but the struggling Vienna Jammin' Java was bought by three brothers Daniel, Jonathan and Luke Brindley in October 2001.[7][8][9] The brothers, all musicians originally from New Jersey, were interested in opening a place where other musicians could play and began to renovate the venue to improve its musical capabilities.[10][11] Renovations to the venue included building a new stage and installing new lighting and sound system, as well as a full bar. The menu was also expanded to include liquor and meals. The club re-opened a few weeks after the September 11 attacks and struggled in its first few years. The musical acts originally focused on singer-songwriters and local bands, but has since moved on to more varied offerings such as punk, rock and pop acts.[7][12] Over the years the venue became more successful and well-known, earning accolades such as being named one of the top 40 music clubs in America by Paste magazine, topping reader polls from The Washington Post for local live venues and being named one of the best places to hear live music by AOL Cityguide.[13] In October 2011, Jammin' Java celebrated its tenth anniversary under the Brindley owners. The anniversary month featured special events and concerts and allowed patrons to buy a month-long pass for $100.[7][8] As a musical venue, Jammin' Java is a 200-seat club that offers daily live music. Shows average more than once daily and the venue has held about 7,000 concerts from 2001 to 2011.[10] During the day Jammin' Java features Tot Rock, a family-oriented music series. The club also teaches music lessons with Music School at Jammin' Java.[14] Owner Daniel Brindley also operates an artist management company out of the club with Go Team! Music Artist Management as well as a record label, Go Team! Records. Artists managed by the company include Chelsea Lee, Rocknoceros and Deep River.[10][13]
