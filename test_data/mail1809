03000379 The Fells Connector Parkways are a group of historic parkways consisting of portions of The Fellsway, Fellsway East, and Fellsway West in the cities of Malden and Medford, Massachusetts in Greater Boston. The parkway portions serve to connect the Mystic River Reservation with the Middlesex Fells Reservation. The parkways were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.
