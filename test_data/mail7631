Their official website is http://www.gdcc.net.au Glenelg competes in the South Australian Grade Cricket League, a competition administered by the South Australian Cricket Association. A-grade players in this competition vie for selection in South Australia's Sheffield Shield team, which leads to possible selection in the Australian Cricket team. The club currently fields 4 senior and 6 junior teams, using Gliderol Stadium, Camden Oval, Immanuel College and Bowker Street Oval as their home grounds across the grades. The club is situated in the trendy beachside suburb of Glenelg, with its headquarters being less than a kilometre from Glenelg Beach and the well-known Jetty Road precinct.
