This is a list of by-elections to the Scottish Parliament, in reverse chronological order. Where seats changed political party at the by-election, the result is highlighted: red for a Labour gain, yellow for a Scottish National Party (SNP) gain, blue for a Conservative gain, orange for a Liberal Democrat, and grey for any other gain.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
