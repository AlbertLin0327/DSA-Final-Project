Han Ji-min (born November 5, 1982) is a South Korean actress. Han Ji-min started her career in show business while still a high school student. She did various commercial films (CF) and music videos before gaining wider attention in 2003, when she appeared in hit Korean television dramas All In and Dae Jang Geum. Han said she hadn't dreamed of becoming a serious actress, but changed her mind after starring in All In, where she played the teenage counterpart of the drama's main character, played by popular actress Song Hye-kyo. After her breakthrough performance in the critically acclaimed mania drama Resurrection,[1] Han challenged herself by playing a cute yet ambitious tomboy who dreams of becoming a pilot in her first movie Blue Swallow.[2] A car accident on the set of Wolf seriously injured Han and her co-star Eric Mun,[3][4][5] causing the drama to be delayed repeatedly[6] until the decision was finally made to discontinue it with only three episodes aired. After a long recovery for Mun, the two actors reunited instead in the drama Super Rookie Ranger[7] (also known as Invincible Parachute Agent or Korea Secret Agency). Han also hosted the weekly showbiz news program Entertainment Relay on KBS from 2006 to 2008. She continued to act in TV dramas, with memorable turns as straitlaced resistance fighter Jo Ma-ja in Capital Scandal and royal concubine Sung Song-yeon in the historical drama Yi San.[8][9] Known for her sweet, innocent and fragile image and her depictions of pretty, good girls,[10] Han surprised audiences with her performance as a sexy femme fatale in Detective K: Secret of the Virtuous Widow.[11] Han played a cynical veterinarian in Padam Padam... The Sound of His and Her Heartbeats, written by lauded drama writer Noh Hee-kyung, which aired on newly launched cable channel jTBC.[12] She is currently starring in fantasy-sageuk-contemporary romantic comedy fusion drama Rooftop Prince, about a Joseon-era prince whose princess dies, then time-travels to the 21st century where he meets his beloved's doppelgnger.[13] A Social Welfare major from Seoul Women's University, Han is widely known for actively participating in volunteer work and fund drives, mostly through the relief organization Join Together Society. In 2009 she published her own book titled Were Already Friends: Han Ji-mins Philippines Donation Book, which includes stories and drawings of her time spent in a deep mountain village in the Philippines helping at a village school.[14][15] She then donated all the royalties to help in funding the education of children in North Korea and developing countries in Asia.[16] She was rumored to be engaged to Cain and Abel co-star So Ji-sub; both denied any romantic relationship.[17]
