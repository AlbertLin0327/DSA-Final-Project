Sri Krishnanjaneya Yuddham (Telugu:  ) is a classical Telugu film directed by C. S. Rao. The film was released in the year 1972. The film mainly revolves around Lord Anjaneya waiting for Lord Sri Rama's darsanam in Dwaparayuga. This Hindu mythological movie is based on Lord Anjaneya's devotion towards Lord Rama who later finds Rama in Lord Krishna. The movie begins with how the pride of Pandavas(Arjuna & Bhima) is destroyed by Hanuma and later Garuda in search of his daily food and finds a Nagakanya as his prey. Nagakanya is guided by Narada to go to Hanuma for help where she becomes safe. Garuda reports this to Lord Krishna and his wives Rukmini & Sathyabhama. Krishna sends out a warning to Hanuma to release Nagakanya for garuda's prey. But Hanuma doesn't care for his warning & continues to protect Nagakanya. This leads to a war between them as Hanuma doesn't recognise Rama in Krishna at first. Sathyabhama disguised as Sita tries to mislead Hanuma but fails. Later how the war gets stopped and Nagakanya is saved forms the rest of the story.
