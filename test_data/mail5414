The Savannah Civic Center is a 9,600-seat multi-purpose arena located on Montgomery Street in Savannah, Georgia. The facility has two venues: The Martin Luther King Arena and the Johnny Mercer Theater. The arena seats 3,500 to 9,600 attendees, depending on the event while the theater seats up to 2,524 concert- or theater-goers and features one of the largest proscenium arches in the southeastern United States.[citation needed] The facility also includes a Grand Ballroom and East and West Promenades each with a capacity of 400. Each year, the Savannah Civic Center hosts the Savannah Tire Hockey Classic, which awards the Thrasher Cup and numerous meetings are held in the building's meeting wings. Built in 1974, the Savannah Civic Center was home to the Savannah Bees and the Continental Basketball Association's Savannah Spirits basketball teams. The MLK arena was the host venue of the 1986-87 Big South Conference's men's basketball tournament. Category | Metropolitan area
