The Waybacks, also known as The Waybacks at Home and in Town, was a 1915 Australian play by Philip Lytton which was adapted from the stories by Henry Fletcher about the comic adventures of a rural family. The play was seen as attempt to cash in on the success of the theatre version of On Our Selection, and enjoyed almost as much popularity at the box office during its original run.[1] The plot involves the Wayback family visiting Sydney and having various adventures.[2] There was a film version in 1918.[3]
