David Brown (born 12 July 1959) is an Australian meteorologist for Seven News in Melbourne and the national Seven 4.30 News bulletin. He was also the former weather presenter for Sunrise.[1] Brown graduated from Caulfield Institute of Technology (now part of Monash University) in 1981 with a B.App.Sc. degree. He then worked at the Bureau of Meteorology before becoming a weather presenter, initially on Network Ten.[2] Brown is one of few television weather presenters who is also a meteorologist. He has been reporting weather on Seven News since 1995 in Melbourne, and nationally since 2003. In January 2008, Brown replaced Monique Wright on Sunrise taking the role as weather presenter. Brown stayed as weather presenter for 6 months on Sunrise, whilst continuing with his other duties at the Seven Network on the national Seven 4.30 News and Seven News Melbourne. Brown quit in July 2008, citing his heavy work load (having to work on three separate news programs throughout a 12-hour span). His replacement was Fifi Box.[3] Brown is married with two daughters. He is a Carlton supporter.[4]
