Rugby union in French Guiana is a minor but growing sport. The governing body is the French Rugby Federation, which has a regional section called the Comit Territorial de Rugby de Guyane. Rugby was first introduced to French Guiana by the French. More talented players tend to leave for Metropolitan France. There have been occasional games against sides from the Caribbean islands, and nearby countries such as Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana. Most of its rugby contacts are either with them, or with France itself.
