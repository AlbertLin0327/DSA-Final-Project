See text. Lechanorchis is a genus of orchids (family Orchidaceae) belonging to the subfamily Vanilloideae. The scientific name is derived from the Greek words lekane (basin) and orchis (orchid). They occur in mountain forest of the Himalayas, tropical and subtropical Asia, New Guinea and some Pacific islands at altitudes between 300  1500 m They are terrestrial, leafless myco-heterotrophs (formerly called saprophytes). They produce numerous, long, thick, horizontal roots under a short rhizome. The erect, dark, branched or unbranched stems are thin and brittle. They bear few to many dull brown, purple, yellow or green flowers with a somewhat brighter lip. The lip is about of equal length to the sepals and is covered with dense, yellow hair. Characteristic for this species is: Lecanorchis Blume (1956).
