Currently, it teaches subjects in preparation for AS and A-level Examinations, for students generally aged sixteen to eighteen.[1] The college presently accommodates approximately 1100 students from Warwickshire, West Midlands and neighbouring counties. King Edward VI Grammar School came into being on 11 May 1552 as a grammar school, following the grant of a royal charter by King Edward VI.[2] The school was originally a fee paying school, although the county council provided some scholarships, and became non-fee paying as a result of the education act of 1944. The voluntary aided school had around 400 boys in the 1960s.[3] In 1974 the grammar school closed and was re-established as King Edward VI College.[2] The oldest surviving school building located in the grounds of the St. Nicholas Church dates from 1595, was rebuilt in 1696 and was used as a school until 1880. In 1880 the Grammar school was relocated to the current site on King Edward Road, the other side of the church yard. The new building was built in a Tudor style by the architect C.C. Rolfe.[2] The college was frequently extended during the 20th century to accommodate growing numbers of students. The Arnold Building, a new building opposite the main college site, was completed in 1994. In 2006 another small building was constructed next to the Arnold Building to hold the history department. In recent years the college has expanded it's site with a new Study Centre, a specifically designed modern Art Block, Law Classrooms, Physics Labs, a re-developed Library and Student Refectory. A codified constitution was created in 2007 which made provisions for student representation in college affairs. It identified two institutions responsible for representing the students of the college; the 'College Council' which consists of representatives from each tutor group in the college and the 'Student Executive Committee',[4] which consists of six elected positions: Collectively the College Council and Student Executive Committee are responsible for: organising charity fund-raising events, College Parties and the end of year Valedictory Ball. They are also involved in planning the annual 'Celebrating Student Achievement Evening', they meet with the Board of Governors and may make proposals regarding various student/college related issues to the Principal of the College.[4] The Nuneaton Old Edwardians Rugby Football Club (RFC) was initially founded in 1910 to provide rugby football for former pupils of the Grammar School, the club went open in 1955 allowing players from all backgrounds to join. The club is still active and as of 2012[update] is participating in the Midlands 1 East League.[5] The college offers an enrichment programme which is designed to offer a wide-range of sporting and recreational opportunities to students. These timetabled activities take place once a week and are compulsory for first year students. Although enrichment is not compulsory for students after their first year, they are free to continue with it if they choose. Activities include various sporting activities, participation in college media (e.g. the college newspaper, radio station and film-making club) and a variety of clubs/societies.[4] The King Edward VI College Alumni Association was launched in May 2011 by former students Vicky Fowler and Mohsin Shah. The association is open to all former college students and staff members. It aims to organise social and network events for former students of the college, provide careers advice support for current students and promote the work of King Edward VI College within the local community.
