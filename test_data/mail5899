Miranda Fricker is an English philosopher. She currently holds the position of Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at Birkbeck, University of London. She received her DPhil from the University of Oxford before taking up a Jacobsen Research Fellowship and later a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of London. Prior to writing Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing (2007), Fricker co-edited The Cambridge Companion to Feminism in Philosophy (2000) with Jennifer Hornsby. Her research interests include ethics, epistemology, and feminist philosophy. Observer of academic philosophy Julian Baggini has said of Hornsby and Fricker that they "cannot be labeled 'feminist philosophers'", claiming that "they are philosophers, period, who have incorporated feminist insights into their philosophy and are keen that others do the same".[1]
