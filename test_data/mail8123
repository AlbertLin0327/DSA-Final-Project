Kilshoge railway station is a railway station that will serve the new Kilshoge housing development in the south of Dublin and is located on the South Western Commuter route from Dublin Heuston as part of the Kildare route project. It is the last of a series of new and upgraded stations to be built on the route to improve commuter services from the South-West of Dublin, prior to the construction of the Interconnector.[1][2] Construction of the station is complete but is yet to be opened due to the lack of development in the area. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
