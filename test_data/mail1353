Smithers-Jones is a song written by Bruce Foxton for recording with his bandmates in The Jam. Smithers-Jones differs from the majority of tracks by The Jam in that it was not written by guitarist vocalist Paul Weller. "Smithers-Jones" was originally recorded as a straightforward rock take for the B-side of the non-album single "When You're Young". The track was strikingly reworked with strings for the Setting Sons album. "When You're Young" was released months before the album's release. Smithers-Jones is widely considered Foxton's finest songwriting three minutes. The Setting Sons recording is redone in an all-strings arrangement, save a bit of electric guitar in the coda. According to the liner notes of the Direction Reaction Creation box set, the revamping of "Smithers-Jones" was suggested by drummer Rick Buckler. Stiff Little Fingers regularly performed the song live after Foxton joined.
