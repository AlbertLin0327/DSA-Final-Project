The first record in the 100 metres for men (athletics) was recognised by the International Amateur Athletics Federation, now known as the International Association of Athletics Federations, in 1912. The record now is 9.58 seconds which was run by Usain Bolt. As of 21 June 2011(2011 -06-21)[update], the IAAF had ratified 67 records in the event, not including rescinded records.[1] From 1975, the IAAF accepted separate automatically electronically timed records for events up to 400 metres. Starting January 1, 1977, the IAAF required fully automatic timing to the hundredth of a second for these events.[2] Jim Hines' October 1968 Olympic gold medal run was the fastest recorded fully electronic 100 metre race to that time, at 9.95.[2] Track and Field News has compiled an unofficial list of automatically timed records starting with the 1964 Olympics and Bob Hayes' gold medal performance there. Those marks are included in the progression. The IAAF considers marks set at high altitude as acceptable for record consideration. However, some observers[11] have noted that high altitude can significantly assist sprint performances. One estimate suggests times in the 200m sprint can be assisted by 0.09 s to 0.14 s with the maximum allowable tailing wind (2.0 m/s), and gain 0.3 s at altitudes over 2000 m.[12] For this reason, separate low-altitude lists have been compiled, though the IAAF does not officially recognize separate records. Once the IAAF started to recognize only electronic times, marks set at high altitude were not equalled or surpassed by low-altitude performances until 1987. The following progression of low-altitude marks starts with the "record" when the IAAF started to recognize only electronic timing and continues to the first mark that equalled the world record in 1987. (Ben Johnson's 9.95 run in 1986 and 9.83 run in 1987 are omitted.)
