The Forty-Third Assembly District of Connecticut elects one member of the Connecticut House of Representatives. Its current representative is Democrat Diana Urban, who defected from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party in November 2006[1]. The district consists of the entire towns of Stonington and North Stonington and was formerly represented by ex-US Congressman Rob Simmons.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
