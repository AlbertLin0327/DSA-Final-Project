The supporters create a great atmosphere with their Band Team (known as BandoESES) during the seasons as well. Besides BandoESES, there is another supporter group (known as KoreoESES) who are always creating very different and unique shows, with some beautiful choreographies for every single match at the stadium and away on the road. Eskisehirspor supporters are really different than others when it comes to supporting their club through 2nd and even 3rd divisions. They regard their old fashioned stadium as holy grounds and reject the idea that it be moved to the outskirts of the city for the modern one. Many other team's supporters envy them because of their passionate, obsessive and dominant atmosphere in the matches. But they gain recognition as one of the most fierce fanbases in Turkey and many respect them and call them as the "phenomenon" of the Turkish Football. Founded in 2006 in the 'Samba Bar', Eskiehir, what started as a group of friends has grown into one of the most well known and respect supporter groups in Turkey. Bando-ESES currently has 23 active musicians playing instruments ranging from Trumpets to traditions Turkish davul drums. They are accompanied by loyal backing members who also help out. The group bring a change to the usual chanting and really liven games up turning matches into a carnival atmosphere. They can help to control the tempo of the game and have a range of musical styles. The group are well organized and are constantly growing.[4] The club colors were inspired by French club Stade Rennais 1964-1965 Coupe De France win, the board saw Rennes celebrating lifting the cup on the front page of a football magazine and immediately fell in love with the club colors and adopted them as their own believing that it would bring them good luck.[4] The unmistakable emblem was actually designed by Eskisehirspor's first club chairman Aziz Bolel and perfected by graphic designer Selahattin Vapur, the three stars represent the merger of Akademi Genlik, dmanyurdu & Yldztepe.[4] Eskiehir Atatrk Stadium (Turkish: Eskiehir Atatrk Stad) is a multi-purpose stadium in Eskiehir, Turkey. It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home ground of Eskiehirspor. The stadium holds 13,520 people and was built in 1953.[5] It was named after the Turkish statesman Mustafa Kemal Atatrk. New Eskiehir Stadium will be a multi-use stadium in [Muttalip district of (North) Eskiehir, Turkey. The stadium will have a capacity of nearly 33,500 people (all-seated) and will be totally covered. It would be also one of the 9 candidate host stadiums of Turkish bid for EURO 2016.[6] But Turkey has lost the election of the CUP. Despite this result, the Chairman of TFF said "we have to work on these stadiums like a winner of the election, I'm going to talk about it with Primeminister". According to this explanation, Turkey is going to bid for the next tournament as a host country as well and the projects will be constructed due to its schedule. The New Eskiehir Stadium[7] will be the centrepiece for the development of a new sports, business and university park, planned by the City of Eskiehir at the northern periphery of the town. Eskiehir is famous for Sepiolite (Meerschaum) mining which has left a distinct signature on the landscape and inspires the faade of the stadium. The inner walls will be constructed partially with serigraphic glass to provide maximum transparency from the inside and to emphasise its open character at night. A newly planned tram will connect the New Eskiehir Stadium with the city centre, the airport and the university. This new public transport will accelerate the development of the new sports, leisure and business area. A new express ringroad around the city will also pass just south of the stadium providing excellent access. On 7 January 2010 signed the Eskiehirspor president Halil nal, Eskiehir mayor Prof. Dr. Ylmaz Bykeren and Eskiehir governor Mehmet Kllar the agreement to construct the new stadium in Muttalip.[8] The stadium will also replace the current home ground of Eskiehirspor: Eskiehir Atatrk Stadium.
