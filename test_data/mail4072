Content:
Manumation (or manual automation) is the failure of software or hardware control systems that automate workflow processes, systems or industrial machinery. Manumation causes the process to require more human intervention and effort than before the introduction of automation. Manumation can greatly increase the need for human sensory and mental requirements causing an additional burden on operators of the failed automation. In many cases, attempts to fix manumation more often cause additional failures to the automation creating an even more complex manumation processes.
