Peter Caruana Social Democrats Peter Caruana Social Democrats This article is part of the series: Politics and government of Gibraltar General elections were held in Gibraltar on 11 October 2007.[1] The incumbent Chief Minister Peter Caruana narrowly won a fourth term, but opposition leader Joe Bossano had a very strong showing.[2] Joe Bossano noted that this would be his last term as an MP, and joked that he would not join the government, despite receiving a higher personal vote than some members of the Gibraltar Social Democrats (GSD). The GSD had ten candidates (all of which were elected), Bossano's party the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party (GSLP) had seven candidates (four of which were elected) and the Gibraltar Liberal Party (GLP) led by Dr. Joseph Garcia had three candidates (all of which were elected). The Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) fielded six candidates five of whom obtained the least votes in the election after a lacklustre campaign. Two independents were unable to break through Gibraltar's party block vote system but did relatively well. They were the right wing lawyer Charles Gomez of New Gibraltar Democracy and Richard Martinez of the Parental Support Group. An exit poll organised by the Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation (GBC) had given victory to the GSLP/Liberal coalition, but as counting progressed this proved incorrect. 1 These figures have been consolidated by party. Under the Gibraltar electoral system, all candidates are listed on the ballot paper individually. 2 Every voter has up to 10 votes to vote for their choice from all the candidates standing. Accordingly although there are more seats available, the main parties field 10 candidates and hope to secure 'block votes'. Thus the total of 154,743 votes comes from 16,004 voters, an 81.4% turnout of the electorate.
