Ambilikile Mwasapile is a Tanzanian medicine man who uses a tree known as mugariga to make a juice which he claims can cure any disease. The main illnesses that Mwasapile claims to cure are AIDS, diabetes, stroke, high and low blood pressure. The medicine's efficacy has not been clinically assessed. Mwasapile is a retired Lutheran pastor who lives in Samunge village in Loliondo, near Ngorongoro. Mwasapile had a vision in which God instructed him to make his medicine. His vision was of a tree that provided medicine and that many people would come to be healed. After waking up, he said he met a woman who had AIDS and she told him that she came for medicine. Mwasapile followed his vision and allegedly healed her affliction. The woman told her former boss who had fired her due to sickness. The boss had a sick child suffering from brain damage. Mwasapile allegedly healed the child. As word spread, an average of 4,000 pilgrims perday visited him as of early 2011.[1] The government of Tanzania ordered Mwasapile to stop, but due to public demand the government revised the order and provided Mwasapile with support for sanitation. However, his medicine cannot legally be given by other doctors. Notables who have visited Mwasapile include ministers and members of parliament from Tanzania and Kenya and businessmen. The wife of DRC president Joseph Kabila visited Mwasapile. Due to poor infrastructure, road transport costs roughly 500 times the price of the medicine, which is 500 Tanzania shillings.
