NYS Route 90 marker Numbered highways in New York Interstate U.S. N.Y. (former) Reference County New York State Route90 (NY90) is a northsouth state highway in the Finger Lakes region of New York in the United States. All but five of the route's 53 miles (85km) are located in Cayuga County, with the remaining 5 miles (8km) situated in Cortland County. The southern terminus of the route is at an intersection with U.S. Route11 (US11) and NY41 in the village of Homer. Its northern terminus is at a junction with NY31 in the town of Montezuma. Although the route is signed as northsouth, the portion of NY90 from King Ferry to Homer follows an eastwest alignment. It is not to be confused with Interstate90 (I-90), which also passes through Montezuma. The two 90s in fact cross, the only time when two same numbered highways intersect in the state, but there is no access between them. NY90 begins at an intersection with US11 and NY41 in the village of Homer. It heads westward from the village and passes through rural portions of Cortland County on its way into Cayuga County. In Cayuga County, the route traverses the rural towns of Summerhill and Locke to the hamlet of Locke, where it intersects NY38. NY90 continues west into Genoa, intersecting with NY34 and NY34B in the hamlets of Genoa and King Ferry, respectively, before turning northward as it approaches Cayuga Lake. The route heads northward along the eastern lakeshore, passing Long Point State Park in the town of Ledyard and Wells College in the village of Aurora. NY90 continues north through Ledyard and southern Springport to the village of Union Springs, where NY90 intersects NY326. Past this point, NY90 runs through the remainder of Springport into the town of Aurelius. Here, the route serves the village of Cayuga before entering the town of Montezuma and meeting US20 and NY5 just north of the tip of Cayuga Lake and east of the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge. North of Routes5 and20, NY90 follows the Cayuga and Seneca Canal northward for a short distance before turning to the east as it enters the vicinity of the New York State Thruway (I-90). NY90 parallels the Thruway for just under 1 mile (1.6km) before turning back to the north and passing over the toll road as it enters the hamlet of Montezuma. NY90 ends at an intersection with NY31 north of the hamlet. NY90 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It originally began at US11 in the hamlet of Messengerville and passed through Virgil, Cortland to King Ferry, where it ran along the eastern edge of Cayuga Lake to its terminus at NY31 in Montezuma. In Cortland, NY90 had an overlap with NY13 along Tompkins Street from Owego Street to Main Street. At Main Street, NY90 turned north to follow US11 and NY41 to Homer, where NY90 split from the two routes and headed west toward Cayuga County.[1] In the early 1980s, the state of New York assumed maintenance of an eastwest highway connecting NY90 in Virgil to the village of Dryden.[3] Around the same time, NY90 was truncated on its southern end to its junction with US11 and NY41 in Homer. The DrydenVirgil highway and NY90's former routing from Virgil to Messengerville became NY392; from Virgil to Cortland, old NY90 was redesignated as NY215.[4][5] Today, at least two signs showing NY90 signed concurrently with US11 and NY41 still exist in the village of Homer as remnants of its former southward extension.[citation needed]
