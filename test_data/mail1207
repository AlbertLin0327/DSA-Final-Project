The Forest Fire Lookout Association (FFLA) is a group dedicated to the worldwide research and restoration of Forestry Fire Lookouts. The group was formed in 1990 at French Creek State Park in Pennsylvania by people from seven northeastern states. As of 2010, the FFLA has nearly one thousand members, with representatives and Directors in thirty-six states, Canada, and Australia. It actively encourages lookout staffers to join. The Association has active partnerships with the U.S. Forest Service and many other groups to restore and preserve the heritage of Fire Lookouts that are active or have been in the past. The Board of Directors represent members throughout the U.S., Canada and Australia. The Executive committee of Secretary, Treasurer, Historian, Chairman, Eastern deputy chair and Western deputy chair meet each January. The FFLA publishes a quarterly magazine. It hosts at least two or more conferences a year at different locations throughout the United States and Canada. The Australian chapter hosts its own annual meeting at the ending of their fire season.
