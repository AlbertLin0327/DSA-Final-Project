Oscar Marion Graham (July 20, 1878  October 15, 1931) was a professional baseball pitcher. In a 17-year career, he won 4 games in Major League Baseball and 272 games in the minor leagues. Graham was 6 feet tall and weighed 180 pounds.[1] Graham was born in Plattsmouth, Nebraska, in 1878. He started his professional baseball career in 1901. In 1902, he won 16 games in the class A Western League. Graham then went to the Pacific Coast League's Oakland Oaks, and he put up some big numbers in the long PCL seasons. In 1903, he went 28-29 with a 3.44 earned run average, pitching 504.2 innings in 61 games.[2] He led the league in games pitched, innings pitched, losses, and earned runs (193).[3] His 234 walks and 49 hit batters during that season are PCL records that have never been broken.[4] Graham was also a good hitter, as he had a batting average of .323 to finish sixth in the league in that category.[5] In 1904, Graham had a slightly lesser workload, as he pitched 392.1 innings and went 19-23 with a 2.89 ERA.[2] Again, he hit well and finished ninth in the batting race at .305.[6] Graham had one of his better seasons in 1905. He pitched over 500 innings for the second time and tied his career-high in wins with 28. His ERA dropped to 2.37, and he led the league with 56 games started.[2][7] The following year, he tossed another 432 innings for Oakland and went 25-23.[2] He was purchased by the American League's Washington Senators in August of that year.[1] Graham made his major league debut with the Senators on April 16, 1907. He ended up appearing in 20 games for them, including 14 starts, and he went 4-9 with a 3.98 ERA. His last MLB game was on August 5, and he then finished the season with the American Association's Minneapolis Millers.[1][2] Graham started 1908 with Minneapolis. He had a winloss record of 8-5 before leaving to play for another team in Virginia, Minnesota, where he was paid a "whopping" $350 each month.[2][8] Graham returned to the American Association in 1909, this time with the Indianapolis Indians. In 40 games, he went 15-15. He started off 1910 with them, as well, but was released in July for "failure to keep in winning condition."[2][9] For the next few years, Graham bounced around the minor leagues. He had his fifth, and final, 20-win season in 1916, when he went 23-12 with a 2.31 ERA in the IllinoisIndianaIowa League.[2] He tied for the league-lead in victories.[10] Graham retired from professional baseball after the 1917 season. He pitched a total of 17 years and won 276 games  272 in the minor leagues and 4 in the major leagues.[1][2] Graham lived in Rising Sun, Iowa, in the winters, and he worked as a corn husker and rabbit hunter during that time.[11] He died in Moline, Illinois, in 1931.[1]
