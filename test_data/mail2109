The Saukiog tribe (sometimes spelled Sickaog or Suckiaug) was an Native American people who lived in the Hartford, Connecticut vicinity circa the early 17th century. The Saukiog spoke an Algonquian dialect and were part of the Algonquian confederation. In 1636 sachem (chief) Sequassen sold their land to the British. Some Saukiog may have subsequently joined the Mattabeseck and, after 1650, the Pocumtuc tribes.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
