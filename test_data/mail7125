Josh Ostrander is an American singer-songwriter best known for being the front man of Eastern Conference Champions (ECC), a band started with his long time friend and collaborator Greg Lyons. ECC came about when the two members, formally of Laguardia, left their first major label record deal with Universal Republic only to sign back to the Universal family via Geffen Records after the two released a self produced EP called The Southampton Collection under the ECC moniker. Ostrander has released four albums to date, one under Laguardia and three through Eastern Conference Champions. Along with producing their own releases, Joshua has been asked to act as producer for such bands as Voxhaul Broadcast (LA) and EX-Happy Mondays member Kavin Sandhu (London). He has worked on projects with such producers as Brendan O'brien (Pearl Jam, Springsteen), Owen Morris (Oasis, Verve), Brad Wood (Smashing Pumpkins), Thom Panunzio, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Ostrander works out of his downtown LA studio called Santa Fe Studios, he is best known for inventing the 'GrassWall' sound, combining an organic feel with the compressive 'Brickwalling' that he and Oasis producer Owen Morris discovered in the summer of 2006 while working together in Woodstock, NY. Beyond music Joshua is an avid visual artist, and human rights advocate.
