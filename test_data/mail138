Northview High School is located in Johns Creek, Georgia, U.S.A. The school is a part of the Fulton County School System. Two of its many notable achievements is earning the Governor's Cup in 2004, 2005, and 2006, which was presented by Sonny Perdue for the largest numerical improvement in SAT scores. Also, the school was named "The Number One School in Atlanta" by Atlanta Magazine. Northview is a School of Excellence and, as of 2007, holds 2nd place for overall SAT scores (1st place for the math section) in the State of Georgia. The school accepts students from River Trail Middle School. Northview used to accept students from Autrey Mill Middle School, but with the opening of Johns Creek High School in fall 2009, Autrey Mill students feed to Johns Creek. The demographics at Northview are diverse; Northview has a large population of East Asians, Indians, African-Americans, as well as Caucasian students. Each year, the school's multicultural organization, the Kaleidoscope Club, creates a Black History production in honor of the contributions African-Americans have made to the American culture. Northview also hosts an International Night each fall where students perform dances, play music, and cook foods representative of the diverse heritage within the student body. Athletic achievements include the 2003 Boys Golf State Champions, 2005 Ice Hockey State Champions, Roller Hockey State Champions, Volleyball State Champions, and the 2006 Girls Golf, Boys Tennis State. In 2007, Northview came to win 4 AAAAA state championship titles in Girls Swim and Dive, both boys and girls Golf, boys Tennis, and Volleyball. The 2007 Girls Lacrosse team was also the state runner-up. The JROTC Titan Battalion also placed First in the drill nationals in 2007. The Titans also won the 2007 Class AAAAA Volleyball Title after defeating Kennesaw Mountain in the finals. The Northview ladies Volleyball would also become the state champions in the fall semester of 2008. In the spring semester of 2008, the Varsity Boy's Soccer team reached the first round of the state playoffs for the first time in school history, while Northview's Varsity Boy's Basketball team reached the Elite Eight under Coach Steve Bombard. Northview's colors are Navy Blue and Silver. Peter Zervakos was Northview's principal when it opened its doors in 2002 and retired at the end of the 2008-2009 school year. While it may seem that the Titan was designated by Zervakos due to his Greek heritage, the fact that the school's symbol is the thunderbolt is contradictory; in Greek Mythology, Zeus slaughtered the Titans with the thunderbolt. The Northview Chamber Orchestra was invited to perform at the Georgia Music Educators' Association Conference in Savannah, GA in January 2004 and again in January 2008, the prestigious Midwest Clinic in Chicago, IL in December 2004 and again in 2010, and was also chosen to represent the State of Georgia for Mozart's 250th Anniversary Celebration in Salzburg, Austria; Vienna, Austria; and Prague, Czech Republic in April 2006. The Chamber Orchestra also performed in Chicago at the 2010 National School Board Association Conference. The Northview Drumline received a superior rating at the GBP (Georgia Bandmasters Program) in 2007. They also ranked 2nd in the AAAA division. Their Colorguard also received a superior rating. Northview currently competes in Region 5-AAAAA and has since 2008.[1][2] In 2010 Northview hosted the playoffs of the Southeastern Lacrosse Conference.[3] As of 2010, Northview is in Region 7-AAAAA along with the teams of Alpharetta, Roswell, Milton, Centennial, North Forsyth, and West Forsyth. The sports that they play include football, basketball, baseball, softball, tennis, lacrosse, volleyball, track, cross country, and golf. Their geographical rivals are Chattahoochee High School and Johns Creek High School. Northview High School also has a selection of great feeder teams. Their 8th Grade Jr. Titans football teams have won state championships in 2008, 2010, and 2011. Their lacrosse team also made the semi-finals of the lacrosse playoffs before losing to state champs, Walton, by a last second goal.
