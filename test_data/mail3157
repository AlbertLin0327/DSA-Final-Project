Moda Ekstraklasa (Polish pronunciation:[mwda kstraklasa], official abbreviation MESA [Polish pronunciation:[msa] or (rarely) [m  s a]]) is a Polish youth football league composed of the top youth teams of the 16 Ekstraklasa sides. It is contested by players 21 years of age and under, however, each side is allowed three players over the age limit (for the 2007/2008 season: players born January 1, 1986 and after). No player may be under the age of 16. In general, the matches take place a day after the two clubs' first teams have faced off, however the venues are switched. The team with the most points at the end of the season receives the title of Moda Ekstraklasa Champion. The games are organized with the aim of encouraging enhanced scouting and youth development in Poland and to provide regular competitive games for young players who often struggle to get playing time in the first team. In the first ever game, played on July 28, 2007 at the Stadion lski in Chorzw, Ruch Chorzw fell to visiting Dyskobolia Grodzisk (1:2). Ruch's ukasz Janoszka scored the first ever goal. On May 18, 2008 Wisa Krakw clinched the first title, with a 1:0 win at home against runners-up Korona Kielce. Marcin Wodecki of Grnik Zabrze was the top goalscorer with 17 goals, closely followed by Artur Sobiech of Ruch Chorzw with 16.
