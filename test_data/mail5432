The biological terrain assessment or BTA is a set of tests used to measure the pH, resistivity, and redox of a person's urine, blood, and saliva. The usefulness of the test is debatable. It is often associated with homeopathy and holistic health. Proponents of the BTA claim that comparing the pH, resistivity, and redox of the blood, urine, and saliva provides a health practitioner an indication of the metabolic processes taking place inside the body. There is no scientific evidence that these measurements provide a medically relevant indication of metabolic processes. Multiple manufacturers of BTA equipment have been prevented from selling their equipment in the United States because they lack Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. However, the FDA has not stated whether the BTA is medically useful or not. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
