The cultural calendar of Cornwall is punctuated by numerous historic and community festivals and celebrations. In particular there are strong links between parishes and their patronal feast days (which are often days not directly linked to official church patronal celebrations). There is also a tradition of holding celebrations associated with tin mining and fishing. Since the 1980s there has been a development of community based festivals in Cornwall often named after a famous local resident. These have included Murdoch day in Redruth, the Daphne du Maurier Festival in Fowey, Trevithick Day in Camborne and the Montol Festival in Penzance. Other modern festivals include, Falmouth oyster festival, Newlyn fish festival, Lowender Peran in Perranporth, Dehwelans Kernow and many more. In Moonta, South Australia, the Kernewek Lowender (Cornish for "Cornish happiness") is the largest Cornish festival in the world and attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year.[1] The following list is of festivals celebrated past and present in Cornwall which can be traced back over 100 years or more, often these celebrations have considerable antiquity. These have been classified separately to the above because they form a part of a Cornish indigenous culture. There have been attempts and successes to revive these celebrations where they have fallen into disuse. Today many of these ceremonies are kept alive by members of the Federation of Old Cornwall Societies.  = Parish feast day Celtic cross Cornish chough Cornish heath Cornish kilts and tartans Jonathan Trelawny Michael An Gof Saint Piran Saint Piran's Flag AberFest Allantide Chewidden Thursday Furry Dance Golowan Guldize Kernewek Lowender Montol Festival Mummer's Day Nickanan Night Noze looan 'Obby 'Oss Picrous Day St Piran's Day Tom Bawcock's Eve Cornish hurling Cornish pilot-gig racing Cornish wrestling Rugby union in Cornwall Cloam oven Clotted cream Cornish cream tea Cornish fairings Cornish Gilliflower Hevva cake Hog's pudding Pasty Saffron bun Stargazy pie Yarg Cornwall Film Festival Tate St Ives St Ives School Newlyn School Barbara Hepworth Daphne du Maurier William Golding Minack Theatre The Pirates of Penzance Tristan and Iseult Cornish bagpipes Brenda Wootton Gwenno Saunders Fisherman's Friends Crowns "Bro Goth agan Tasow" "Camborne Hill" "Come, all ye jolly tinner boys" "Delkiow Sivy" "Hail to the Homeland" "The Song of the Western Men" Cornish literature Ordinalia Beunans Meriasek Bewnans Ke Prayer Book Rebellion Beast of Bodmin Blunderbore Bucca Cruel Coppinger Knocker King Arthur Lyonesse Owlman Piskie Federation of Old Cornwall Societies Gorsedh Kernow Institute of Cornish Studies Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society Royal Institution of Cornwall
