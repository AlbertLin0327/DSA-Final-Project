Takahatafud Station (, Takahatafud-eki?) is a station on the Kei Line, the Kei Dbutsuen Line, and Tama Toshi Monorail Line located in Hino, Tokyo, Japan. Prior to December 2004, the Kei and Tama Toshi Monorail station buildings were not directly connected. Since then, both stations and the Kei Takahata Shopping Center were connected. In June 2006 elevation of the Kei station building and platforms was completed, and nine months later redevelopment work on the Kei Takahata Shopping Center was finished. Most of the passengers boarding at Takahatafud are commuters and students bound for central Tokyo, while those disembarking are visiting the Kongji Temple or are students transferring to the monorail or buses. The station opened on March 24, 1925. Five tracks serve three platforms: four for the Kei Line, one for the Kei Dbutsuen Line. All trains stop at this station. There is a "K-Shop" convenience store and a Tokyo Tomin Bank ATM located outside the ticket gates. The station opened on January 10, 2000. Two tracks serve two side platforms. Due to the concentration of university campuses towards Tama-Center, many students change trains at this station. The namesake of the station is Kongji Temple, also known as Takahatafud, one of the great temples of the Kant region. The area's development was guided first by worshippers visiting the temple, then by suburbanization during the 1960s and 1970s. The station is a major transportation hub for Hino, with many municipal facilities and shopping centers in the vicinity. Coordinates: 353944N 1392448E / 35.662102N 139.413391E / 35.662102; 139.413391
