Agriculture in Malaysia makes up twelve percent of the nation's GDP. Sixteen percent of the population of Malaysia is employed through some sort of agriculture. Large-scale plantations were established by the British. These plantations opened opportunity for new crops such as rubber (1876), palm oil (1917), and cocoa (1950). A number of crops are grown for domestic purpose such as bananas, coconuts, durian, pineapples, rice, rambutan. The climate of Malaysia produces the proper conditions for production of exotic produce. It is located on a peninsula in southeast Asia. This area is very rarely affected by hurricanes or drought.[1] Malaysia maintains a humidity level around ninety percent because of its location close to the equator. The weather stays hot and humid all year round.[2] Malaysia is very populated with hills and large scale agriculture requires a high amount of flat land. Malaysia does not have a strong temperate climate. because of these disadvantages, Malaysia cannot produce enough rice and other food products to supply the country and forces it to import.[3] This ministry is also known as the Kementerian Pertanian & Industry Asas Tani Malaysia. The MOA had its name changed to the current title on March 27, 2004. The ministry serves as an agency for private agricultural businesses to get advised by experts that specialize in agriculture, fishing, and livestock.[4] The ministry plans the policies, strategies, and different development programs. It monitors, surveys, directs, and puts into action the projects given by the Integrated Agricultural Development Project (IADP). The ministry has services such as collecting, analyzing and restoring information and agricultural data through science and provide the report to farmers. It provides references and agricultural management systems for plantation owners to access all collected agriculture information.[5] Rice is a crucial part of everyday Malaysian diet. In 1998, Malaysia produced 1.94 million metric tons of rice.[1] Even with this high production, Malaysia still only produces eighty percent of what it needs to support itself and must import the rest.[6] The average Malaysian citizen consumes 82.3 kilograms of rice per year. The increasing population is calling for more research and technological advancement to increase rice production for consumption within the nation.[7] Nearly twenty four percent of Malaysia's land area is composed of land dedicated to agriculture alone. There are around 43,000 different agricultural machines and tractors. Malaysia contains 7,605,000 hectares of arable and permanent cropland. Malaysia produces 535,000 metric tons of bananas per year. Only about five percent of Malaysia's cropland is actually irrigated.[9] This chart displays a predicted relationship between consumption of rice, the amount planted, and the increase in population from 2008 up until 2030. Typically, Malaysia is responsible for one third of the world's rubber export.[1] However, production has decreased because most estates are switching to a more profitable product, palm oil. Malaysia is also and exporter of timber, pepper, and tobacco. Since 2001, Malaysia's rubber production has been increasing. In 2004, production value reached eight billion dollars, in 2007 it topped ten billion dollars, and in 2008, production value is sitting at 11.24 billion dollars. In 2009 however, production plummeted by nearly six percent. Malaysia has earned a good reputation around the world for its high quality and well priced rubber products. Rubber manufacturers in Malaysia supply several different rubber products such as medical gloves, components for automobiles, belts, and hoses to several different countries such as USA, Japan, and many countries in Europe.[10]
