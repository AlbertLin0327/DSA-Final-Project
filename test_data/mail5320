Arab Idol  , (also called Arab Idol: Mahboub El Arab ( :  )) is an Arabic television show based on the popular British show Pop Idol created by Simon Fuller's 19 Entertainment and developed by Fremantle Media. The first season of the show debut on 9 December 2011 and broadcast worldwide on MBC 1, a Pan Arab television station. This season is hosted by the Kuwaiti actor Abdallah Tulehi and the Lebanese model Annabella Hilal. The show also airs on LBC at the same time. On March 24th 2012, the first season was won by Egyptian contestant Carmen Suleiman against Moroccan contestant Dounia Batma. Arab Idol   replaces Super Star  , a pan-Arab show of the Idol series held in 2003 that was aired on Future Television for 5 seasons. MBC 1 expressed desire to revive the show in a revamped version. The concept is still the same: ten young contestants from all over the Arab world are selected after many auditions, and should perform a song on stage in front off the public and the jury on the main weekly show every friday. Then there will be a 24 hours time period when the viewers will be able to vote for their favorite candidate using SMS. The one who receive the least amount of votes will be eliminated the following evening during the results show, and this every week until there is one left. The winner should win a recording contract with Platinum Records (recording label affliliated with MBC) to record a debut album, a Chevrolet Corvette and many other privileges.
