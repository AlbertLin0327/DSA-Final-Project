Bati is a town and commune in the Hauts Plateau division located in the western province of Cameroon. It is located at Latitude 5.283333 and Longitude 10.28333 (in degrees). Bati is also well-known for its MTN Elite one club Sable FC or "San San Boys". The name comes from the sand production in this mountainous region. The climate is very mild. Rainy season typically lasts from March through October. Dry season begins in November and goes into March of the following year. The closest major city is the Provincial City of the West Province, Bafoussam. The village is located on one of the few pave roads in Cameroon. This two-lane highway connects the Provincial City, Bafoussam, to the economic capital of Cameroon, Douala. Where the highway cuts across the village forms two areas of congregation. One is the carrefour and the other is le march. Le march is the local market that follows the traditional calendar and occurs every 8 days. Since Bati is located on a paved road, traveling to neighboring village is relatively easy. Below is a list of prices via local transportation and time that it would take. (c. 2010) Bati - Baham: 15 min in a taxi (400CFA) Bati  Bamenjou: 20 min on a moto (700CFA) Bati - Bafoussam: 30 min in a taxi (600CFA) Bafoussam  Bagangt: an hour in a taxi (500CFA) Bafoussam  Dschang: an hour in a taxi (500CFA) Bafoussam  Bamenda: 90 min in a taxi (1200CFA) Bafoussam  Foumbot: 30 min in a taxi (600CFA) Bafoussam  Foumban: 45 min in taxi (800CFA) Bafossam  Yaound: 5 hours in bus, (4500CFA) The taxi described here is a typical "bush taxi" where up to 8 people would ride in a 4-person sedan from one to two decades ago. Peace Corps Cameroon had a training center in Bati in the 1980's, and has had a series of volunteers in the community.
