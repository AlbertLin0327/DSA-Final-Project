California Solar Initiative is a renewable energy program in the United States. As part of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's Million Solar Roofs Program, California has set a goal to create 3,000 megawatts[citation needed] of new, solar-produced electricity by 2016  moving the state toward a cleaner energy future and helping lower the cost of solar systems for consumers. The California Solar Initiative has "a total budget of $2.167 billion between 2007 and 2016 and a goal to install approximately 1,940 MW of new solar generation capacity." [1] The CSI initially offered cash incentives on solar PV systems of up to $2.50 per AC watt. These incentives, combined with federal tax incentives, could cover up to 50% of the total cost of a solar system. The incentive program was designed so that the incentives would reduce in steps over 9 years. There are separate steps for residential and non-residential customers in the territories of each of the State's 3 investor-owned utilities. As of September, 2009, the rebates range from $1.10 to $1.90 per AC watt.[1] There are many financial incentives to support the use of renewable energy in other US states.[2] CSI provides more than $2 billion worth of incentives to customers for installing photovoltaic,[3] and electricity displacing solar thermal[4] systems in the three California Investor-Owned Utilities service territories. The program was authorized by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and by the Senate Bill 1 (SB 1): Responsibility for administration of the CSI Program is shared by Investor-Owned Utilities: Residential installation starts in early 2007 fell off sharply because of the disincentives inherent in SB1, requiring time-of-use (TOU) tariffs, with the result that homeowners who install panels may find their electric bill increasing rather than decreasing. The governor and legislature moved quickly to pass AB1714 (June 2007) to delay the implementation of this rule until 2009.
