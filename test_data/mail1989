Tllya is a village in Borsod-Abaj-Zempln county, Northern Hungary, 45 kilometres from county seat Miskolc, in the famous Tokaj-Hegyalja wine district. Tllya is located at 4814N 2113E / 48.233N 21.217E / 48.233; 21.217. According to the 2001 Census the village has a total area of 37.96km2 (15sqmi). As of the census of 2001, there are 2205 people residing in the village; 98.4% Magyars, 1.3% Roma, and 0.3% other. The population density is 58/km. There are 1004 housing units at an average density of 26.44/km. The area has been inhabited since ancient times. The village was first mentioned in the 13th century. According to sme sources the area was settled by Walloon settlers, who brought viticulture to the area; the name of the village possibly comes from the French word taille (meaning "cutting", referring that the tres of forests on the hills had to be cut so that vine can grow there). Tllya soon became the most important village of the Tokaj-Hegyalja wine district. A letter by Bishop Andrew from 1272 mentions that after the Mongol invasion (124142) Italians settled down in the area. Tllya also had a castle by then, which has been destroyed since then, but some of the ruins still can be seen. From 1584 Tllya's Protestant pastor was Gspr Kroli, who was the first to translate the Bible to Hungarian. In the 17th century Tllya was already mentioned as a town, surrounded by a wall and a moat. In 1631 Ferdinand II gave the town right to hold a market and exempted its citizens from taxes. In 1683 Imre Thkly and his supporters met in Tllya during his fight to free Hungary from Habsburg rule; after the freedom fight the imperial troops pillaged the area, which led to the Hegyalja uprising in 1697. In a census from the mid-1780s Tllya was the largest town of Zempln county with a population of 4388. The quick development of the town was mostly due to its vineyards and its hospitality. Anyone who wanted to settle down in Tllya was exempt from paying taxes for 12 years if he plants a vineyard. Still Tllya lost its town rights in 1896 because it couldn't afford paying the expenses of being a town. In 1928 a pyroxene and andesite mine was opened. World War I and II claimed the lives of 110 and 87 Tllya soldiers, respectively. Soviet troops occupied the village on December 14, 1944. After the war the population started to decrease mostly because the village's distance from main roads, the lack of markets for wine, the decreasing price of wine, and the Socialist rgime's industrial politics which tended to favor the major cities over smaller settlements. By 1980 Tllya had only 2815 residents.
