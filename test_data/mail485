Deux (Hangul: ) was a South Korean hip hop duo popular in early 1990s. The duo consisted of Lee Hyun Do and Kim Sung Jae. They were not only colleagues when they were the 2nd generation of the hip hop group, Hyeon Jin Young and Wawa but also close friends to each other. Hip-hop music that was once considered an exclusive music for African-Americans until the early 1990, appeared in South Korea as a mixed form of dance music and rap, called "rap dance".[1] In the mid-1990s hip hop gained great popularity in South Korea and Deux has been considered frontiers of Korean hip hop music along with Seo Taiji and Boys, Kim Gun Mo and DJ Doc. Lee composed their music while Kim took care of choreography and styling.[2] Some of Deux's music has appeared in the Pump it Up. The songs are We Are, Come Back To Me, and Out of the Ring.
