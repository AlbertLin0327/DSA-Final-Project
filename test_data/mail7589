Wendover Woods is an area of woodland on the north edge of the Chiltern Hills in England. Named after the nearby town of Wendover, the woods are owned by the Forestry Commission. Covering 325ha (800acres), the woods are a mixture of coniferous and broadleaved trees. There are several signed walks for recreation, as well as bridleways, picnic and barbecue areas and a children's playground. A Go Ape treetop adventure course opened in 2008. There are views of the countryside in the Aylesbury Vale to the north, and a stone monument marking the highest point of the Chilterns which lies within the woods on Haddington Hill. The Aston Hill Mountain Bike Area is at the edge of the woods. Coordinates: 514618N 04242W / 51.77171N 0.71154W / 51.77171; -0.71154
