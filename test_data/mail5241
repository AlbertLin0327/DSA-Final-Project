Minister of Industry, Science and Technology was an office in the Cabinet of Canada from 1990 to 1995 and was brought back in 2008. Prior to 1990, the responsibilities of the Industry, Science and Technology portfolio were divided between the now-defunct post of Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion and a Minister of State for Science and Technology. In 1995, the portfolio was merged with that of the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs to create the post of Minister of Industry. In the appointments to the Cabinet of Canada of October 30, 2008 under Stephen Harper the portfolio was reintroduced and given to Gary Goodyear.
