MOT is a Norwegian organization formed to combat youth violence and drug use. In Norwegian the word mot is a homonym, meaning both courage and against. The organization was originally started as Norske toppidrettsutvere mot Narkotika (en: Norwegian elite athletes against Narcotics) by Johann Olav Koss, Atle Vrvik and Bjrn Dhlie in 1994. It sold calendars through schools and youth sport teams. In 1996 it was formed officially and changed its name to MOT. Currently, most of the Norwegian Premier League teams play with the MOT logo on their shirts.
