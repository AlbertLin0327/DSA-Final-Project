Route map Chiltern Railways is a British train operating company. It was set up at the privatisation of British Rail in 1996, and operates local passenger trains from Marylebone station in London to Aylesbury and main-line trains on the Chiltern Main Line to Birmingham Snow Hill with its associated branches. In 2002, the company began a new franchise of up to twenty years, subject to the company making various investments in and improvements to the route over that period. The company began as a management buyout by former British Rail managers of the route, but was later absorbed into Laing Rail. In 2008, Laing Rail was taken over by Germany's Deutsche Bahn AG. Management of Chiltern, along with Deutsche Bahn's other UK rail interests, transferred to Arriva UK Trains in early 2011 following DB AG's purchase of Arriva.[1] Chiltern operates services on five routes. The London Marylebone to Birmingham Snow Hill route used by Chiltern Railways goes via High Wycombe, Bicester, Banbury, Leamington Spa, Warwick Parkway, Dorridge and Solihull. Off-peak trains between London and Birmingham operate every half-hour. The fastest timetabled journey from Birmingham to London via this route is 1 hour 30 minutes (compared with 1 hour 22 minutes using Virgin Trains' three-times-an-hour services between London Euston and Birmingham New Street). Since winning the franchise, Chiltern has introduced "Route: High Wycombe" tickets for the Chiltern route between Birmingham and London that are considerably cheaper than "Route: Any Permitted" tickets, valid on the faster Virgin service to London Euston as well a number of other operators and routes. Chiltern offers only Standard Class, not Standard and First Class as on Virgin services. However, Chiltern does offer a so-called premium economy "Business Zone" cabin on a small number of Birmingham to London peak-time trains, using former Wrexham & Shropshire first-class carriages. Passengers pay a 20 upgrade to sit in a larger first-class-style seat and receive free refreshments. Some Chiltern trains continue beyond Birmingham Snow Hill to Stourbridge Junction or Kidderminster. The line to Aylesbury Vale Parkway via Amersham shares its line of route with London Underground's Metropolitan Line between Finchley Road) and Harrow-on-the-Hill, with each operator running on separate tracks, then shares the tracks used by fast Metropolitan Line services as far as Watford South Junction (just after Moor Park, where Metropolitan line services to Watford diverge), with both operators sharing a single pair of tracks from there to Amersham.[2] On certain Bank Holiday Mondays, services are extended from Aylesbury to the Buckinghamshire Railway Heritage Centre facilities at Quainton Road, a short way south of Verney Junction. These services are often run by one of Chiltern's two Class 121 diesel multiple units, referred to as "bubble cars". A shuttle service operates on the branch line between Aylesbury and Princes Risborough on the line to Birmingham via High Wycombe. Certain services from Marylebone via High Wycombe also provide a limited through service to Aylesbury. In 2004 Chiltern Railways took over operation of passenger services on the Leamington Spa to Stratford-upon-Avon branch line. Chiltern's sister company, Wrexham & Shropshire, operated services from North Wales along the Chiltern route to London. This service began on 28 April 2008. Because it gained insufficient passengers to be profitable, it ended on 28 January 2011. Chiltern was also asked to bid for the Snow Hill Lines of the former Central Trains area of Birmingham as part of the new West Midlands franchise competition, but its bid was unsuccessful. Chiltern is the first train operator in the UK to pilot - and subsequently implement - a full system for purchasing, retailing, fulfilling and validating train tickets electronically. As of April 2008, over 18,000 "E-Day" customers have registered to use the service and more than 40,000 electronic tickets have been sold, mainly as barcodes delivered as text messages to the mobile phones of their customers and also as 'Self-Print' tickets.[citation needed] From 22 May 2011 Chiltern operates services on the Oxford to Bicester Line,[3] having taken it over from First Great Western. Initially, the line was franchised to a company formed by the British Rail managers of the route. In 2003 this became a wholly owned subsidiary of Laing Rail, who had held a much smaller shareholding in it at privatisation. In July 2007, Henderson Fund Managers, the owner of John Laing, announced the sale of its Laing Rail subsidiary, as it wanted to focus on its public infrastructure portfolio.[4] Arriva plc and Go-Ahead Group both expressed an interest in acquiring the company,[5][6] but the final bidders were Deutsche Bahn of Germany and NedRail of the Netherlands.[7] In January 2008 it was announced that Laing Rail had been sold to Deutsche Bahn.[8] Following regulatory approval, Chiltern Railways therefore became part of DB Regio, but its management and brand remained unchanged. Deutsche Bahn later bought out Arriva PLC and made DB Regio UK an autonomous division of Arriva UK Trains. Management of Chiltern, along with Deutsche Bahn's other UK rail interests in London Overground and the Tyne & Wear Metro, transferred to Arriva UK Trains in early 2011.[1] The "core" off-peak Chiltern Railways timetable is currently as follows: In addition, Chiltern Railways runs one train a day from London Paddington to keep traincrew route knowledge up to date (as the route is regularly used for diversions during periods of engineering work), one train a day from Birmingham Snow Hill to Oxford, and a single train per week from Stratford to Oxford. Chiltern is considered one of the best operators in Britain, with Public Performance Measure (PPM) regularly over 90% during the past 5 years. Chiltern is the only operating company to have achieved over 95% performance over 12 months.[9] Chiltern's PPM is measured on stricter conditions than its long-distance rivals, such as Virgin Trains, as Chiltern has a 5-minute window for performance while others have a 10-minute window. The latest performance figures, published by the ORR (Office of Rail Regulation), rate Chiltern Railways as one of the most punctual train operating companies in the UK at 93.0% (PPM) and 94.0% (MAA) as of the fourth quarter of financial year 2010-11.[10] A new timetable introduced on 4 September 2011, combined with significant disruption caused by engineering work, has caused a negative reaction from the customers of the local line. A petition to have the service reviewed has begun and articles highlighting the plight of commuters have appeared in the press.[11] Evergreen is the name given by Chiltern to the major infrastructure works that the company has committed to over the 20-year duration of its franchise to improve routes and services. Up to 2009, this has been divided into three distinct phases. The main focus of phase 1 was the redoubling of the Chiltern Main Line between Aynho Junction and Princes Risborough, together with the reconstruction of Haddenham and Thame Parkway from a single platform to two platforms, the installation of a new platform at Princes Risborough, and the raising of the line speed limit. Phase 2 began after the award of Chiltern's new 20-year franchise. This entailed a realignment of the route through Beaconsfield to allow speeds to be increased to 75mph, improved signalling between High Wycombe and Bicester and between Princes Risborough and Aylesbury, the construction of two new platforms at London Marylebone (located on the old carriage sidings), and the construction of a new maintenance depot near Wembley Stadium. The Department of Transport, Chiltern Railways and Network Rail agreed on 15 January 2010 to a 250m upgrade of the Chiltern main line. Phase 1 of the project, now complete, involved upgrading the Marylebone - Birmingham Chiltern Main Line to permit 100mph running on 50 more miles of route. Junctions at Neasden, Northolt and Aynho were remodelled to permit higher speeds.[12] The 'up' through track has been restored at Princes Risborough, the existing 'up' line becoming a platform loop, a new turnback siding has been provided at Gerrards Cross, and a new, straighter 'down' through track built from Northolt Junction (originally built to favour the now little-used Paddington route) to Ruislip Gardens. The existing 'down' track continues to serve South Ruislip station. The former speed restrictions through Bicester North have been removed to permit 100mph running.[12] Two additional terminating platforms at Birmingham Moor Street have been reopened. Accelerated services were initially planned to start in May 2011, but there were delays. The Chiltern Mainline service with accelerated timings from Birmingham to Marylebone finally began on 5 September 2011.[13][14] As a result of the speed increases, journey times have been reduced significantly. From Marylebone, the fastest peak-hour journey time to Birmingham Moor Street is now 90 minutes, instead of 117 minutes as previously. The table below outlines the peak timetable improvements.[15] Chiltern Railways chairman Adrian Shooter said, "This is the biggest passenger rail project for several generations not to call on the taxpayer for support. Working closely with Network Rail, we are going to create a new main-line railway for the people of Oxfordshire and the Midlands. This deal demonstrates that real improvements to rail services can be paid for without public subsidy by attracting people out of their cars and on to trains." Under Phase 2 of the Evergreen 3 project, a quarter-of-a-mile double track will be constructed joining the Oxford to Bicester Line at Bicester Town to the Chiltern Main Line, allowing a new Oxford to London Marylebone service to operate. As part of this plan, the Oxford to Bicester Line transferred from First Great Western to Chiltern,[3] and trains will call at Bicester Town and High Wycombe. Part of the line between Wolvercote Tunnel (on the outskirts of Oxford) and Bicester Town will be restored to double track, and a new station constructed at Water Eaton Park-and-Ride. The scheme will include additional platforms at Bicester Town, Islip and Oxford. This part of the Evergreen project is subject to Transport and Works Act approval by the Secretary of State, and is expected to be completed by 2013. Network Rail said its investment will be reimbursed by a "facility charge" over the next 30 yearsinitially by Chiltern Railways, whose franchise expires in 2022, and then by the future franchisee. The infrastructure upgrade is being carried out by main contractor BAM Nuttall, in partnership with Jarvis and Atkins. The 200m project, which is being promoted by Chiltern Railways, had originally proposed doubling the entire route from Oxford to Bicester; however, structural problems found in September 2009 may mean that the section between Bicester and Islip remains single-track. This would not affect the Evergreen plans but would limit intended services between Oxford and Milton Keynes as part of the proposed East West Rail Link.[citation needed] Oxfordshire County Council supports the scheme but remains to be convinced of the benefits to be gained from a new station at Water Eaton, which would be in the Green Belt.[16] All signalling on the route (including the new platforms at Oxford) would be controlled by Marylebone Signalling Centre. There was a further setback to the plan when in November 2011 a planning inspector withheld approval, when it was found that bats were roosting in Wolvercote Tunnel. Great Crested Newts also have a breeding habitat close to the route.[17] The "bat problem" however seems to have been resolved.[18] Chiltern Railways operates services using a fleet of Class 165 "Turbo", 168 "Clubman" and 172 "Turbostar" units. The "Turbo" units have undergone refurbishment at Bombardier's Ilford Works, and the Class 168s have recently been lengthened. Chiltern also operates a single Class 121 "Bubble Car" on its Aylesbury to Princes Risborough line. This heritage unit was extensively refurbished, and operates the majority of the services on that line.[citation needed] When starting in 1996, Chiltern inherited 34 Class 165/0 (Networker) diesel multiple units fitted with Automatic Train Protection and a tripcock so they could be used on London Underground lines on the approach to London Marylebone. The trains were originally used for both suburban and commuter services, including to Birmingham. However, the Class 165 was designed for suburban travel and not intercity services, unlike its sister, the Class 166, and so, following healthy growth, Chiltern took delivery of Class 168 units, leaving the Class 165s to be concentrated on stopping services to Banbury and Aylesbury, although they are still sometimes seen on the runs to Birmingham. Chiltern now runs all 39 Class 165/0 in existence, following the transfer of five units from First Great Western. All units were refurbished in the late 2000s. Improvements included the installation of air conditioning and removal of the 'hopper' opening windows.[citation needed] The first Class 168 ("Clubman") type to arrive was the 168/0, which externally resembles the Networker Turbo but is better suited to the long-distance service to Birmingham, and was later the basis for the Class 17x Turbostars. The Clubman trains were the first to be delivered after privatisation, and allowed Chiltern to intensify its commuter services, while also providing more comfort on the intercity runs. Later orders of the Class 168 produced the 168/1 and 168/2, which had the Turbostar wiring and external design, and so can be considered to be Turbostars. The Class 168 differs from the rest of the Turbostar family in that it is fitted with the tripcock and ATP, the same as the Class 165/0.[citation needed] In 2008, Chiltern ordered four 2-car "Turbostar" units to increase capacity. These were delivered to Chiltern in May 2011, entering passenger service on 8 June 2011. After driver training and mileage accumulation they are working stopping services between London Marylebone and High Wycombe.[citation needed] As of May 2011, Chiltern is operating a fleet of loco-hauled Mark 3 coaches on main-line services from London to Birmingham and Banbury, using the newly reopened platforms at Birmingham Moor Street. The motive power is provided by four Class 67 units from the unsuccessful Wrexham and Shropshire venture together with the addition of a fifth unit, 67018 'Keith Heller', painted in Chiltern's owner DB's livery.[citation needed] As of July 2011 the coaching stock was all standard class. Additional unrefurbished 'slam door' coaches have been leased in from Porterbrook and units in the Virgin Trains red background livery are mixed in with 'Inter City' Blue/Silver stock. EX WSMR stock retains the now defunct livery with the decals removed. Rakes consisted of loco, five carriages and DVT It is anticipated the carriages will be completely refurbished, and will have sliding doors (similar to those of the Mark 3s operated by Iarnrd ireann) and toilet retention tanks fitted. Deutsche Bahn owns 12 coaches and a number of DVTs already, with options on others from ROSCOs. Introducing these on the Birmingham express trains will then allow Chiltern to cascade the Class 168s currently used on to other services.[19] Chiltern has also obtained a second Class 121 unit, 121034, to supplement its existing one on the Aylesbury-Princes Risborough route. This has been refurbished and repainted in the authentic 1960 British Railways green, complete with crest, and Yellow cab ends.[citation needed] The rolling stock used on the Birmingham Moor Street to London Marylebone express services (ex WSMR) has been rebranded in "Chiltern Mainline Silver" livery.[citation needed] Tesco proposed building a supermarket over the railway line near Gerrards Cross railway station in 1996,[23] which, following an initial objection by the local council was approved by the Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott in July 1998. Due to a lack of space in the area, Tesco had proposed building over the railway line, which would free up a large area of land suitable for the development.[23] During construction, the partially built tunnel collapsed on 30 June 2005. Nobody was injured but the line was closed for over six weeks, eventually reopening on 20 August 2005. Compensation by Tesco to Chiltern Railway and Network Rail was estimated to be between 5-20m and the retailer pledged to fund a media campaign to win back passengers lost by the closure of its route[clarification needed][citation needed]. Construction of the tunnel finally resumed in January 2009.[24] The store opened in late November 2010.[25] It was announced that from 2010, the operating rights of Wrexham & Shropshire, in which Deutsche Bahn was also a shareholder, were planned to be combined with Chiltern Railways, but the separate Wrexham & Shropshire brand retained.[26] However, this did not occur and the Wrexham and Shropshire service has subsequently closed.[27] In addition to the completed and ongoing Evergreen initiatives many other potential enhancements for Chiltern's route have been discussed, but not progressed to date. These include: As successful completion of Project Evergreen 3 would confirm Chiltern Railways' twenty-year franchise term, there is no clear road to completion for these projects.[37]
