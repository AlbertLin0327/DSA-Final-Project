Trypt0fanatic is the third album from the Kidneythieves, released on July 20, 2010. The physical CD is only being distributed independently through the band's official website. There have been 5 bonus tracks digitally released only during 2010-2011. These include "Light Deceiver" (originally a free pre-order), "Tears On A Page [Live Acoustic]", Jude (Be Somebody) [Acoustic], and 2 remixes of "Lick U Clean", one by Beat Ventriloquists (included when you purchase a selected Tee or Tank from the KT Store), and the other by KMFDM.
