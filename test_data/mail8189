Jackie Valentine is a four piece Canadian pop/rock band from White Rock, British Columbia. In 2009, they joined the 604 records roster (Carly Rae Jepsen, Marianas Trench, Theory of a Deadman, Daniel Wesley), and have since released three singles along with their first full length studio album "Building Walls & Burning Bridges". The bands sound is described as "blue-eyed pop with a twist", and "pop-redux, with classic hooks and rhythms rooted in the 1960s and 70s but thoroughly new millennial".  The band was formed by lead singer/frontman/song writer Kieran Mercer and lead guitarist Cameron Gray. Shortly after, they were joined by Mercer's former high school band mate Martin Leather as bassist/background vocalist, and locally acknowledged drummer Graham Boots. Since the formation of the band in 2008, the lineup has not changed. Upon the release of first single "Brand New Car", Jackie Valentine was the featured artist on Vancouver's Virgin Radio 95.3 as BC's Band of the Month for March, 2011. Produced by 54/40's Dave Genn, The album "Building Walls & Burning Bridges" received notable praise from Vancouver's Province newspaper and BC's Adrian Mack of The Tyee, writing that "debut album Building Walls and Burning Bridges is so stunning in its range and confidence that it simply doesn't matter what genre the band slots into". Jackie Valentine toured in summer of 2011 as the opening act for Juno Award winning band Marianas Trench, and in fall of 2011 as the opening act for Carly Rae Jepsen. They have also toured with West Coast sensation Daniel Wesley around the lower mainland and on Vancouver Island The band is currently working on new material with Producer Danny Craig (Default)
