The Schiemann reaction (also called the Balz-Schiemann reaction) is a chemical reaction in which anilines (1) are transformed to aryl fluorides (3) via diazonium fluoroborates (2).[1][2] Named after the German chemists Gnther Schiemann and Gnther Balz, this reaction is the preferred route to fluorobenzene and some related derivatives.[3] The reaction is similar to the Sandmeyer reaction, which converts diazonium salts to other aryl halides.[4]
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
