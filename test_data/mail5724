The 1949 Cleveland Browns season was the team's fourth and final season with the All-America Football Conference. The Browns won their fourth straight league championship. In the season's sixth game on October 9, 1949, the San Francisco 49ers stopped the Browns' professional football record long unbeaten streak after 29 games. The streak started two years before on October 19, 1947, and included two league championship games and two tie games.
