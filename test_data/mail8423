The Shaumari Wildlife Reserve is a Jordanian nature reserve near the town of Azraq, approximately 100km east of Amman. It is a regionally important reserve created in 1975 by the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature as a breeding center for endangered or locally extinct wildlife. The 22 square kilometer reserve is a thriving protected environment for some of the most threatened species of animals in the Middle East.
