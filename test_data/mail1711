Angels and Demons at Play is a jazz album by the American musician Sun Ra and his Myth Science Arkestra. Side one was recorded in 1960, including two tracks taken from the mammoth session either at Hall Recording Company or at the RCA Studios (both in Chicago), around 17 June 1960 [1] whilst the tracks on side two were recorded at the RCA studios, Chicago, around February 1956. At least three of the songs (Medicine for a Nightmare b/w Urnack, and A Call For All Demons, the B-side of an early version of Saturn (the song)) had been issued on early Saturn (the record label) 7" singles [1]. According to the musicologist R Campbell, the latter single was probably the very first Saturn release [1]. It was a relatively common theme of Saturn releases to feature different sessions, from different eras with different personnel, on different sides of a record. Other examples include The Invisible Shield (1962/1970) and Deep Purple (1948-57/1973). The distinctive sleeve was designed by Sun Ra, and uses the same design on both sides, leaving no room for sleeve notes. All titles were written by Sun Ra, except where noted. Side A: Side B: The 1993 compact disc release appends the album The Nubians of Plutonia in its entirety. On "Urnack", "Medicine for a Nightmare", "A Call For Demons", and "Demon's Lullaby", recorded RCA Studios, Chicago, around February 1956;[1] On "Tiny Pyramids" and "Angels And Demons At Play", RCA Studios Chicago, around June 17 1960;[1] On "Between Two Worlds" recorded during rehearsals at the same time;[1] On "Music From The World Tomorrow", also recorded during rehearsals in Chicago, 1960;[1]
