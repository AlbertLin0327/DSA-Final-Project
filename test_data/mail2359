Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana, Inc. (TMMI) is an automobile manufacturing factory located nearly halfway between Princeton, Indiana and Fort Branch, Indiana, USA. It is part of Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing North America (TEMA), owned by Toyota Motor Company of Japan. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana was built in 1996 in order to begin production of a full-size pickup truck solely for the U.S. Market. TMMI began production of the Tundra began in 1999 for the 2000 model year, and Sequoia production began a year later for the 2001 model. Both the Tundra and the Sequoia were new to the market and have only been sold in North America. The Tundra replaced the Toyota T100 in the U.S. market. In 2003, production of the Sienna minivan shifted to TMMI for the release of the 2004 Sienna, while Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky produced the Solara in place of the Sienna. On July 10, 2008, Toyota announced that they would consolidate Tundra production at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Texas in San Antonio after 2008, and that due to the large unsold supply of Tundras and Sequoias, production of both Tundras and Sequoias would be suspended. Toyota also announced that production of the Highlander would be shifted to TMMI and would start in 2009; the new facility Toyota is building in Mississippi will now build the Toyota Corolla in 2011.
