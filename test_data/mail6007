The 2009 Big 12 Conference Baseball Tournament was held at AT&T Bricktown Ballpark in Oklahoma City, OK from May 20th to May 24th, 2009. This was the fourth year the conference uses the round robin tournament setup. The winners of each group at the end of the round robin face each other in a one-game match for the championship. The Texas Longhorns defeated the Missouri Tigers, 12-7 to win the championship.
