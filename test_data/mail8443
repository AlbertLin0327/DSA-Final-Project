Det Kongelige danske Skortarkiv (English: the Royal Danish Nautical charts archive) was a Danish Navy department, responsible for making accurate nautical charts for the Danish government, primary the Navy, for nearly 200 years. It was initiated by royal resolution of October 25, 1784, at the initiative of a naval captain, Poul Lvenrn, who would also become the first director of the department. April 1, 1973 the department, together with Lodsvsenet (the pilot service), Fyrvsenet (the lighthouse service) and Redningsvsenet (the rescue service), was merged into Farvandsdirektoratet, in that process changing its name to Nautisk Afdeling and gaining a few more responsibilities. By royal resolution of October 9, 1987, the nautical chart production part was detached and combined with Geodtisk Institut and Matrikeldirektoratet to form Kort & Matrikelstyrelsen, where it today is a department called Skortomrdet. According to resolution of 1816, nautical charts produced by Skortarkivet has no copyright expiration date.[1] They are permanently copyright protected by the Danish government. This order is still valid according to the Danish copyright law  92.[2]
