Shin Jae-min is a South Korean bureaucrat. He was the former Vice Minister of Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. He made a controversial statement of mentioning that the President of South Korea has a legal rights to fire the top executive of the Korean Broadcasting System on July 5, 2008.[1] Shin was the subject of the confirmation hearing around late August 2010 for his actions of illegally speculating in real estate, money-laundering, registering over phony resident address; earning his nickname "corruption department store".[2][3] On November 28, 2011, the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office arrested Shin for bribery charges from a lobbying incident that involved Lee Kuk-chul, chairman of the shipbuilding company, SLS Group.[4][5][6]
