Coordinates: 505712N 25511W / 50.953305N 2.919634W / 50.953305; -2.919634 Ilton is a village and civil parish in Somerset, England, situated 8 miles (12.9km) south-east of Taunton, and 2 miles (3.2km) north of Ilminster in the South Somerset district. The village has a population of 849.[1] The parish includes the hamlets of Ilford and Cad Green with its 16th century almshouses.[2] "The settlement on the River Isle" was one of the possessions of Athelney Abbey until the dissolution of the monasteries. The current hamstone Ilford Bridge probably dates from the early 18th century when it was on the Curry Rivel to Chard turnpike road.[3] The current A303 is just south of the village. East of the village is a moated site which is all that remains of Merryfield (or Muryfield), which was the seat of the Wadham family. In the 17th century it was home to Nicholas and Dorothy Wadham, benefactors of Wadham College, Oxford.[4] In the 18th century the Chard Canal was built close to the village. This had been intended as a part of a ship canal, passable by vessels of up to 200 tons, between the Bristol Channel and the English Channel, but was never completed. North of the village is the Merryfield aerodrome, which served as a bomber base in World War II, reopened as HMS Heron II, RNAS Merryfield and was then used for helicopter training.[4] Ilton Halt was a small station on the Chard Branch Line which closed in 1962. It included a platform of concrete construction. The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on April 1, 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Chard Rural District.[5] The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. The church of St Peter dates from the 14th century, and includes memorials to the Wadham family.[4] It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building.[6] This town had a halt which formed part of the Chard Branch Line railway. During wartime (World War II) it also served the nearby Merryfield aerodrome.
