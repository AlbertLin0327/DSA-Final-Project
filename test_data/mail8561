Nasir Ahmed (born January 1, 1964, Dacca) is a former Bangladeshi cricketer who played in 7 ODIs from 1988 to 1990. He is one of the three best wicketkeeprs to play for Bangladesh, Shafiq-ul-Haq and Khaled Mashud being the other two. After the retirement of Haque, the selectors tried a number of young keepers, and Nasir (commonly known as Nasu) emerged as the most competetent one. After cementing his place in 86, he was a regular in the national side until 1993. He eventually lost his place mainly due to tactical reasons, not for any keeping deficiencies. With one day game becoming more and more competitive, the team required a wicketkeeper who can bat up the order. Other players fulfilled this criterion better than Nasu. After retiring from cricket as a player, Nasu continued to serve the game as a national selector.
