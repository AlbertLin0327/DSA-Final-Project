The Al Mannai (Arabic: ) tribe (plural: Al Mananea (Arabic: )) is an Arab bedouin tribe, based primarily in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. In Bahrain, the traditional home of the tribe has been Galali village. The tribe used to be involved in the lucrative pearl diving industry. The Al Mannai tribe was one of the several bedouin tribes to move to Bahrain in 1783, after the Al Khalifa conquered the island. Al Mannai tribes are located in the whole Persian Gulf area, especially in Qatar and Bahrain. Al Mannai today has many known tribes, such as: Al-Binejmy Al-Hashel Al-Salam Al-Ibrahim Al-Najam Al-Salah Al-Hamad a.s.o. The Mannai family brought out other family names such as Attiyah(Arabic: ) . The Emir of Qatar, HH Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani is linked to Attiyah because of his mother which is from the Attiyah family.
