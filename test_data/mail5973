Welland/Niagara Central Airport, (TC LID: CNQ3), is located 3.5NM (6.5km; 4.0mi) west of Welland, Ontario, Canada. Niagara Central accommodates a flight school, aerial photographers, and tourist traffic in small engine aircraft. The airport is also the home of the 87th Eagle Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets who have training and administration space in the airports former meeting place of welland fire company number 1. The Southern Ontario Gliding Centre (SOGC) of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets also utilize the airport for spring and fall familiarization flights for the cadets. In 1995, various members of Fonthill Branch 613 of the Royal Canadian Legion tried to lobby for the renaming of the airport to "Bud Kerr Welland Airport" in honour of a local World War II Spitfire fighter pilot, but the attempt was met with general ambivalence by those with power to do so.
