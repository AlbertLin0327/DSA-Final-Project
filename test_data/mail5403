Caryocar tomentosum Willd. Caryocar tuberculosum (Aubl.) Baill. Pekea tuberculosa Aubl. Caryocar nuciferum, the Butter-nut of Guiana, is also known as Pekea-nut, or  like all other species of Caryocar with edible nuts  "souari-nut" or "sawarri-nut". It is a fruit tree native to northern Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guyana, Panama, and Venezuela. It grows up to 35 m, in humid forests. Flowers are hermaphroditic and in small clusters. The large coconut-sized fruit, weighs about 3kg and is 1015cm in diameter, is round or pear-shaped, and greyish-brown in colour. It is covered with rust-coloured lenticels. The outer skin is leathery and about 1mm thick. Pulp of the mesocarp is oily and sticky, holding 1-4 hard, woody, warty stones, with tasty reniform endocarp, which is eaten raw or roasted, and produces an edible oil. The wood is durable and used for boat-building. It is an effective healing balm if the oil of its nuts are squeezed out correctly. It is a colourful tree, and very good for burning.
