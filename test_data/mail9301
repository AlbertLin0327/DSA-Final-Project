The eminences of the lower circumference of the true pelvis are separated by three notches: one in front, the pubic arch, formed by the convergence of the inferior rami of the ischium and pubis on either side. The angle at which they converge is known as the subpubic angle. As seen in the picture to the right, there is a distinctive difference between the pubic arch of a male and a female. This difference is found in the subpubic angle. The area in which the pubic arch is located is the pelvis, the area that is most different between male and female anatomy. The subpubic angle of a man is around 90 degrees while that of a woman is around 120 degrees. The reason for this difference has to do with childbirth. A womans pubic arch is wider in order to allow for the passage of the child during birth. The pelvic inlet of a female is also wider because the childs head must pass through it. The pubic arch is also referred to as the ischiopubic arch.  This article was originally based on an entry from a public domain edition of Gray's Anatomy.
