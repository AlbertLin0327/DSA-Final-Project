Bildu ("Gather" in Basque) is a Basque nationalist, separatist and abertzale leftist political coalition active in the Basque Country and Navarre. It was official launched on 3 April 2011.[1] Its main member is Eusko Alkartasuna, a social-democratic party, although the majority of votes and militants come from the outlawed abertzale left. Bildu was formed as a response to the March 2011 ruling by the Supreme Court of Spain that banned a new Basque party called Sortu from being registered. Bildu is a coalition of Eusko Alkartasuna, Alternatiba (a splinter group of Ezker Batua) and independent individuals from the outlawed Basque leftist-nationalist environment. Bildu was initially banned as well by the Supreme Court due to their alleged ties to Batasuna, the alleged political wing of ETA. The decision to ban Bildu resulted in street protests in Bilbao and other cities. However, on 5 May 2011, exactly the day the election campaign started off, the Constitutional Court of Spain lifted the ban and Bildu was allowed to take part in elections.[2] At the 2011 Spanish regional and local elections Bildu received 26% of the vote, finishing second in the Basque region only to the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV).[3] The party won seats on most of the councils of the Southern Basque Country, including San Sebastin (where it finished first), Bilbao, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Pamplona. For the 2011 general election Eusko Alkartasuna, Alternatiba and their allies formed a new alliance, under the name Amaiur, along with Aralar, previously part of Nafarroa Bai, and other abertzale groups.
