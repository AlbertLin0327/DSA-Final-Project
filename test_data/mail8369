Get Fired Up is the debut album of Murk as Funky Green Dogs, released on Twisted Records (U.S.)/MCA Records, catalog number TWD-11511. The production of the songs on the album don't stray too far from the catchy, successful formula the two major club chart hits and pop crossover hits "The Way" and "Fired Up." Other hit singles include "Some Kind of Love" and "Until the Day."
