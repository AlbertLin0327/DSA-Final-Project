John Veron, credited in research as J. E. N. Veron, and in other writing as Charlie Veron, is a wide-ranging specialist in corals and reefs. He has three higher degrees in different fields, was former Chief Scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, and has many professional awards including the Darwin Medal (International Coral Reef Society) and the Silver Jubilee Pin (Australian Marine Sciences Association). His home website provides links to his most recent books and electronic information products.[1] The latter include "Coral Geographic" (maps of all the world's coral species) and "Coral ID" (an electronic tool for identifying corals). His latest book (2008) A Reef in Time: the Great Barrier Reef from Beginning to End (Harvard University Press) is a synthesis of many sciences for a popular readership. He presents the case that if humanity continues to produce carbon dioxide at present rates for another decade, the coral reefs will be committed to wholesale destruction and the initiation of the sixth mass extinction. For further information see key words on these subjects and the "Coral Triangle Initiative", a major conservation program launched in Bali in December 2007. Veron has criticised global warming skeptics like Ian Plimer, saying of Plimer's book Heaven and Earth: "Every original statement Plimer makes in the book on coral and coral reefs is incorrect, and that "[Plimer] serve[s] up diagrams from no acknowledged source, diagrams known to be obsolete and diagrams that combine bits of science with bits of fiction."[2] In July 2009, Veron told The Times that, due to global warming, "there is no way out, no loopholes. The Great Barrier Reef will be over within 20 years or so".[3]
