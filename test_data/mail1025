It was the second temple to be dedicated in Canada (the first one being the Cardston Alberta Temple), making it the first country in the world outside the United States to have two temples within its borders at the time of dedication. Germany would become the second country outside the United States to have two temples when Germany reunified some six weeks later. The temple is located on 5.26 hectares (13.0acres) in Brampton, which is 32 kilometres (20mi) west of downtown Toronto. On top of the temple is a gold-leafed statue of the angel Moroni with a trump in his hand. Ground was broken for the temple on 10 October 1987 and the temple was dedicated by church president Gordon B. Hinckley on 25 August 1990. The temple has a total of 5,386 square metres (57,970 sqft), four ordinance rooms, and six sealing rooms.
