"Whisper My Name" is the title of a country music song written by Trey Bruce. It was recorded by Randy Travis on his 1994 album This Is Me. It was released in June 1994 as the album's second single, it became a Number One country hit for him in both the United States and Canada. "Whisper My Name" is a mid-tempo in which the narrator uses metaphors to explain the emotions he feels when his lover whispers his name. Thom Jurek of Allmusic cited the song as a standout track in his review of the album, saying it was "among the greatest songs Travis has ever recorded. The backing vocals by Suzy Ragsdale, Darrell Scott, and Verlon Thompson set the tune apart and accent what a grateful love song this is."[1] "Whisper My Name" debuted at number 67 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks for the week of June 11, 1994.
