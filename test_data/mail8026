This article is part of the series: Politics and government of Japan A leadership election was held in the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan on 28 September 2009 after the incumbent party leader and outgoing Prime Minister of Japan Tar As announced that he would resign after losing badly in the general election held on 30 August 2009.[1] As announced on 8 September he would resign on 16 September 2009,[2] which he did as planned.[3] Endorsement by at least twenty LDP lawmakers is necessary to become a candidate in the election. Since there are 387 LDP Diet members and 141 prefectural LDP representatives (three for each of the 47 prefectural chapters), there is a total of 528 votes. Former finance minister Sadakazu Tanigaki announced on 13 September 2009 he would stand in the election. Tanigaki had also been a candidate in the 2006 leadership election, were he came in third place behind Shinz Abe and Tar As. Yasutoshi Nishimura and Tar Kno (son of former LDP leader Yhei Kno) are the other two announced candidates.[4] Farm minister Shigeru Ishiba was also considered a possible candidate, but he did not stand.[5] A public debate was held on 19 September 2009.[6] Tanigaki was elected with 300 of 498 ballots.[7]
