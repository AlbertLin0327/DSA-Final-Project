OT Band is a Serbian band found in Belgrade in 2009. It was formed by four contestants of Operacija trijumf, the Balkan version of Endemol's Fame Academy.[1][2] The contestants Vukain Braji, ore Gogov, Nikola Paunovi and Nikola Sari are commonly known as the OT Rockers, due to their affirmation to the rock music.[3][4] The band took part in the Beovizija 2009, Serbia's national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, with a song "Blagoslov za kraj", written and produced by Universal Music,[5] and won 2nd place.[6] Operacija trijumf, the Balkan version of Fame Academy, began on September 29, 2008. The contestants include young singers from all the countries of former SFR Yugoslavia (except Slovenia)  Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Macedonia. Four of sixteen contestants were Vukain Braji, ore Gogov, Nikola Paunovi and Nikola Sari. All of them are from Serbia; Braji was born in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but has lived in Serbia since his childhood. During the show, Braji, Gogov, Paunovi and Sari were recognized as rock musicians, and they were named the OT Rockers.[7][8] The singing professor Mirko Vukomanovi, and a famous Serbian music producer, told that Braji and Sari are very good guitarists, the best at the academy.[9] Gogov and Paunovi do not play any instruments, but were noticed by their rock music affirmation and good performing.[10] They performed merely rock songs, originally played by famous rock artists, such as Nirvana, Queen, Billy Idol, Lenny Kravitz, Bijelo Dugme, Deep Purple, AC/DC, Bryan Adams, Bon Jovi and others. However, none of them won. Gogov was expelled at the ninth gala event, being beaten in telephone voting by Braji. Paunovi was expelled at the tenth gala event, losing to Croatian Ana Bebi. Sari was expelled at the eleventh gala event, losing to Braji. Braji was the finalist of the show.[11] One of the OT jury members, Croatian musician Toni Hulji, said he sees Braji, Gogov, Paunovi and Sari in a rock band.[12] However, none of the future band members thought that was a good idea, except Paunovi, all of them wanted a solo career.[13] After the ending of Operacija trijumf, almost all the contestants expressed a will to take part in the Eurovision Song Contest;[14] Braji, Gogov, Paunovi and Sari were finally united in a rock band, and confirmed they are taking part in the Beovizija 2009.[15][16] In January 2009, the group was officially formed.[17][18] In the band's interview for Blic magazine (published on February 17, 2009), Gogov said that, in the beginning, only Paunovi was for the band, but that the rest of them soon changed their minds.[19] Their song, "Blagoslov za kraj",[20] was written and produced by Universal Music.[21] The band said, in their interview for Blic magazine (February 17, 2009, issue), that they have become great friends and they are happy to be together in a band.[22] Braji said that the audience should not expect a boy band such as the Backstreet Boys, but a rock band.[23] The OT Band was an opening act at the concert of James Blunt in Belgrade[24]
