Kokkola (Swedish: Karleby) is a town and municipality of Finland. The town is located in the province of Western Finland and is part of the Central Ostrobothnia region. The town has a population of 46,602 (31 January 2012)[2] and covers an area of 2,730.81 square kilometres (1,054.37sqmi) of which 1,286.61km2 (496.76sqmi) is water.[1] The population density is 32.27 inhabitants per square kilometre (83.6/sqmi). The municipality is bilingual with 84.2% being Finnish and 13.9% Swedish speakers. The Finnish name Kokkola means "place of bonfire" or "place of eagle" because the Finnish root word kokko means both bonfire and white-tailed eagle (the suffix -la denotes location). The town was known in Swedish by the name Gamlakarleby until 1 January 1977 when the surrounding land municipality of Kaarlela (Swedish: Karleby) was consolidated with Kokkola, and the town took over the Swedish name of Karleby. The word gamla means "old", karl means "man" or "peasant" and by means "village", in tearn literally meaning '"old village of peasants" or Anglicised as "Old Peasantville". The Latin name was Carolina Vetus.

The Kokkola railway station is a stop along Line 7, with service between Helsinki and Kemijrvi via Tampere and Seinjoki, where the fast Pendolino bullet train operates. There is no passenger ferry traffic from Kokkola. The town of Kokkola was chartered in 1620 by king Gustav II Adolf of Sweden, when Finland was a part of the Swedish Empire. Kokkola was founded as a shipping port for the tar trade. It also became an important shipbuilding centre in Finland. As a result of tar trade and shipbuilding industry Kokkola was for a time the richest town in Finland.[citation needed] An interesting historical affair, known as the Skirmish of Halkokari, occurred at the town of Kokkola in June 1854 during the Crimean War. Royal Marines from HMS Vulture and HMS Odin tried to come ashore to ransack the town, but were repelled by local defenders, of which many were civilians armed with hunting rifles. One of the 9 smaller British craft (a gunboat) fell into the hands of the defenders. As such, this boat was the only Royal Navy vessel still in foreign possession in 1914. The boat is still today a museum-object and can be seen in Kokkola's English Park. The town council has refused to return the boat despite several requests by the United Kingdom, most recently by John Stuttard, the Lord Mayor of London. The British Treasury annually pays a small sum for the maintenance of nine graves of nine Royal Marines killed in action during the skirmish to the local church congregation.[6] The city had a Swedish-speaking majority until 1933. In 1977, the surrounding municipality of Kaarlela (Swedish: Karleby) was consolidated into Kokkola (Swedish until then: Gamlakarleby). In 2009, the municipalities of Lohtaja, Klvi and Ullava were consolidated with Kokkola. Kokkola is the capital and only city in the region of Central Ostrobothnia.
