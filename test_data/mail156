In the 1747 English cricket season, the single wicket form of the game was very popular among the gamblers of London and matches were disrupted because of a General Election. Pre-announced in the London Evening Post on Sat 9 May but no report of the game was found. Apparently it was unfinished on 29 May and the players agreed to play it out more than a week later. The previous match being incomplete would be played out on Tuesday next at Duppas Hill. No details reported. They have played two matches this season, and each won one with great difficulty, being two days playing each match. No details known other than that wickets were to be pitched at two oclock. Two games between Kent and All-England were due to be played at Bromley Common on Mon 29 June and at the Artillery Ground on Wed 1 July, but both matches are deferred on account of the gentlemen subscribers being engaged at several Elections.[3] The Parliamentary Election of 1747 resulted in a Whig government under Henry Pelham (1694-1754). In those days, voting was limited to landed gentry (i.e., to fully paid up members of the Hanoverian aristocracy). This was pre-announced in the Penny London Post of Wed 1 July as the deciding match but there is no report of the game and no references to the earlier fixture(s). A scratch match arranged by members of the London Cricket Club. Most players names are known but no scores. The exact title is unknown but one team consisted mainly of players from London, Bromley and Slindon, the other mainly of players from Dartford and Hadlow. Teams were: Long Robins XI: Robert Colchin, John Bryant, James Bryant, John Bowra, "Little" Bennett, Thomas Jure, Richard Newland, Adam Newland, John Newland and two others W Hodsolls XI: William Hodsoll, Broad, John Bell, Thomas Bell, Allen, J Harris, Tom Faulkner, John Larkin and others from the parish of Hadlow in Kent. It is not known which of John or Joseph Harris was involved. This was billed as Long Tom versus the Kentish Shepherd, those being the nicknames of Tom Faulkner, who was also a prizefighter, and John Bowra. A statement by Mr George Smith, the Keeper of the Artillery Ground: These matches being attended with great Charge the Door, for the Future, will be Six-pence; Two-pence not being sufficient to defray the Expense. The match was to be played for fifty guineas per side. No details reported. Hadlow, near Tonbridge in Kent, was stated to be a famous parish for cricket. This game and the next one were the two postponed earlier in the season because of the Parliamentary Election. Another statement from George Smith: The Town may be certain that the taking Six-pence Admittance is out of no avaricious Temper. Two-pence being greatly insufficient to the Charge that attends the Matches, which Mr Smith is ready and willing to make appear to any Gentleman. The advertised teams (in the Daily Advertiser on Mon 31 August) were: Kent: Robert Colchin, John Bryant, James Bryant (all Bromley), Val Romney, Kipps, John Mansfield (all Sevenoaks), John Bell, Thomas Bell (both Dartford),  Jones, John Larkin (both Hadlow), Robert Eures (Bexley). All-England: Richard Newland (Slindon),  Green (Amberley, Sussex), Stephen Dingate, "Little" Bennett, Thomas Jure (all London), Thomas Faulkner, Joseph Harris,  Broad, George Jackson (all Addington), William Sawyer (Richmond),  Maynard (Surrey). No details reported. This match was advertised at the same time as the first one and not subsequently. Mon 6 July. Five of Slindon versus Five of Dartford at the Artillery Ground.[2] This was the result of a challenge by Slindon, published in the Daily Advertiser on Mon 29 June, to play five of any parish in England, for their own Sum. The announcement advised interested parties: If it is accepted of by any, they are desird to go to Mr Smith, who has Orders to make Stakes for them. The three Newland brothers all played. On Sat 4 July,[5] Mr Smith announced in the same paper that five of Dartford in Kent, have made Stakes with him, and will play with the above Gentlemen at the Time and Place above mentioned for twenty Pounds. Wed 8 July. Five of Slindon versus Five of Bromley at the Artillery Ground.[4] Another game resulting from Slindons challenge. The Newland brothers played for Slindon again. Fri 10 July. Five of Slindon versus Five of Hadlow at the Artillery Ground.[5] Another game resulting from Slindons five-a-side challenge. Details unknown. Wed 15 July. Five of Slindon versus Five of Hadlow at the Artillery Ground.[5] A return game which suggests Hadlow might have won the first as Slindon, having issued the initial challenge, might wish to try for honours even. Details unknown. In early August, there were two single wicket matches,[5] at the Artillery Ground which were organised by the Duke of Richmond. In the first, three of his employees Stephen Dingate, Joseph Budd and Pye defeated the two Bennetts and William Anderson. In the second, the same threes were to play again but in a "fives" match with the two Bryants added to the Dukes team and with Tom Faulkner and one of the Harrises to their opponents. The result of the second game is unknown. Sat 5 September. Three-a-side game at the Artillery Ground: Long Robins Side versus Stephen Dingates Side. The teams were Robert Colchin, John Harris and Val Romney against Stephen Dingate, Richard Newland and Thomas Jure. It was played for sixty guineas per side and the players were specially chosen from those who had played in the Kent v All-England games above, so presumably they must have been the best performers in those matches. It was ruled that all Strokes behind as well as before Wickets counted and in this respect the contest differs from any Three Match ever playd.[2]
