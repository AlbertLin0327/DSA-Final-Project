Luke Tonkin is an Australian actor, who made his professional musical theatre debut in the Helpmann-nominated children's musical My Grandma Lived in Gooligulch and toured the show nationally and playing the role of the Big Bopper in the Australian tour of Buddy - The Buddy Holly Story. Luke Tonkin was born in Ballarat on 4 March 1976. He is the second son of Ron and Val Tonkin. His much better looking older brother is Andrew. He also has a younger sister and brother, Kristyn and Dale. Luke gave up a promising football career to pursue acting, something greatly encouraged by his father. Beginning in primary school productions, Luke has barely been off the stage his whole life. He has become a celebrity in his home town of Ballarat due to his work with the Sweet Mona Choir, Entertainers Anonymous and Sovereign Hill. But Luke's proudest moment is yet to be unveiled when he opens the Ron Tonkin Memorial School of the Theatrical Arts in early 2012.
