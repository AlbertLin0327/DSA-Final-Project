J.P. Morgan was a judge on the Missouri Supreme Court from 1969 until 1982, and the Chief Justice of that same court from 1977 to 1979. Morgan authored a 1982 decision declaring that pension benefits accrued during a marriage are marital property, rather than the separate property of the person who earned the pension. He also wrote a 1976 decision saying it was constitutional to provide public tuition grants to college students who attended private colleges, and a 1978 decision upholding industrial development corporations, which permit low-interest financing for businesses.[2]
