Tlio Mouro (b. January 18, 1952) is a pianist and composer from Minas Gerais, Brazil. He was a former member of Os Mutantes, in its progressive rock phase. He has played with artists such as Chico Buarque, Caetano Veloso, Mercedes Sosa, Pat Metheny, Paul Winter, and Jon Anderson. Milton Nascimento, Pat Metheny, Bob Berg, Maria Bethania, and Eugnia Melo e Castro, among other artists, have recorded his songs. Tlio Mouros instrumental music is founded on a firm base of melodic construction. This and his experience with soundtracks allow him to create themes that are far from mere pretexts for improvisation. Tlio seeks to establish a personal and original profile within the Brazilian instrumental music scene, producing music ranging from the classical genre to religious chants from the sacred and popular tradition of Minas Gerais. He said, "The pianist exercises a more brazilian and rhythmic profile through a stimulating dynamic between the left and right hand, resulting in a so baptized jazz mineiro." Tlio is one of the curators of the Ouro Preto International Jazz Festival  Tudo  Jazz and also hosts the TV program Noturno for Rede Minas TV. In his career with soundtracks, he was honored with an award from the Associao Paulista dos Crticos de Arte in 1989 for The Long Haul and the Best Music Award at the Festival de Braslia in 1998 for O Viajante.[1] 1991  Carioca - with Nonato Luiz  Caju Music/Milestone
