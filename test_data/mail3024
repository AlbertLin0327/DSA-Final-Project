5504/15 Gorm is a natural gas and oilfield in the Danish Sector of North Sea that was discovered in 1971. It is the largest oilfield exploited by Denmark.[1] The field consists of five platforms[2] and is operated by Maersk Oil. The facilities include two wellhead platforms and several processing platforms. About 400 barrels per day (64m3/d) of crude oil from the nearby Rolf oil field are processed on the Gorm platforms.[3] An oil leak occurred in the field on 2 March 2011. [4][3]
