CBS Daytime (CBSD) is a television programming block on CBS. It's the branding for the CBS Television Network's late morning and early afternoon programming. The block has historically encompassed soap operas, game shows, and talk shows. NOTE: All times are Eastern Standard. * Local CBS stations have the option to air Let's Make a Deal at 10 am or 3 pm, as the network provides two separate feeds. Despite little genre output when compared to NBC and ABC, CBS is the last remaining Big Three broadcast network to carry daytime game shows. When NBC and ABC were still producing several game shows in daytime, CBS gave up on the format during the 1967-68 season. From 1968 until March 1972, the network carried no game shows. However, as part of CBS's "rural purge" effort to lure wealthier suburban viewers, CBS executive Fred Silverman commissioned the new game show Amateur's Guide to Love. Hosted by Gene Rayburn, the show ran from March 27 to June 23. Despite the failure of Amateur's Guide, Silverman commissioned three other games for debut on September 4  The New Price Is Right, Gambit, and The Joker's Wild  to replace the reruns seen in the daytime slots up to this point. All were major hits, and more games were added as time went on; Joker ended in 1975 and Gambit in 1976, but both have spawned revivals. The Price Is Right has aired continuously in daytime on CBS since its debut. Currently, CBS is carrying two network games  Price and a 2009 revival of Let's Make a Deal. Prior to the revival of Let's Make a Deal, the last game on CBS other than The Price Is Right was the Ray Combs version of Family Feud, which was cancelled in 1993, though it remained in syndication until 1995.
