CKPT-FM is a Canadian radio station with a hot adult contemporary format broadcasting at 99.7 FM in Peterborough, Ontario. CKPT originally began broadcasting at 1420kHz AM in 1959. In 2001, CKPT changed from its soft oldies format in favour of a national sports radio network The Team. In August, 2002, after just over a year on the air, then-owner CHUM Limited reversed their decision on the Team format and returned to its soft adult contemporary/oldies format. In March, 2007, CKPT was given approval by the CRTC to convert to the FM band at 99.3MHz [1]. The frequency was chosen by CHUM. CKKK-FM did apply to move from 99.5 to 90.5 FM in March 2007, so CKPT can move to its new FM frequency at 99.3MHz. CKKK-FM was approved on July 9, 2007 to move from 99.5 to 90.5 FM and the frequency change to 90.5 FM took place on August 20, 2007. Later in 2007, CKPT was included in the takeover of CHUM Limited by CTVglobemedia. On August 21, 2007, CKPT-FM signed on 99.3 with a new hot adult contemporary format under the new name "Energy 99.3".[2] The change came just one day after CKKK-FM moved from 99.5 to 90.5 FM. The new CKPT signal will simulcast on its old 1420 AM frequency, until it's turned off after its simulcasting period has ended. On May 5, 2008 at 4:00 p.m. EDT, engineers pulled the plug on the old 1420 AM frequency and left the air forever.[3][4][5][6][7] On January 14, 2008, CKPT-FM (CTVglobemedia) proposes to amend the licence by changing the frequency from 99.3MHz (channel 257B) to 99.7MHz (channel 259B) [8], in order to resolve interference issues to CBC Radio One's CBCP-FM on 98.7 FM. The move from 99.3 to 99.7 FM was approved on February 27, 2008.[9] On June 2, 2008, the remaining of the AM four tower array on Crowley Line was taken down. A week earlier, two of the towers were actually toppled, because of structural deterioration. The same day the old AM towers came down on June 2, 2008, CKPT-FM (Energy 99.3) moved to its current frequency at 99.7 FM with the same format and new branding Energy 99.7.[10]
