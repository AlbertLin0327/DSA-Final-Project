The 1983 Danish 1st Division season was the 38th season of the Danish 1st Division league championship, governed by the Danish Football Association. It constituted the 70th edition of the Danish football championship, and saw Lyngby Boldklub win their first championship title. The Danish champions qualified for the European Cup 1984-85 qualification, while the second and third placed teams qualified for the qualification round of the UEFA Cup 1984-85. The three lowest placed teams of the tournament were directly relegated to the Danish 2nd Division for the following season. Likewise, the Danish 2nd Division champions and two first runners-up were promoted to the 1st Division.
