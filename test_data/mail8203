Dai Chuanzeng (or Dai Chuan-ceng, 1921-1990, Simplified Chinese: ), was a prominent Chinese nuclear physicist who did fundamental contributions to PR. China's nuclear research and industry. Dai was born on 21 December 1921 in Dayan Village, Yin County (present Yinzhou District) of Ningbo, Zhejiang province. Dai graudated from the famous Xiaoshi High School () in Ningbo. Dai studied physics and graduated in 1942 from the National Southwestern Associated University (NSAU). Dai taught as an assistant at NSAU, Sun Yat-sen University and Tsinghua University. Dai topped (ranked first of totally 400) the Sino-British Boxer Rebellion Indemnity Scholarship Program.[1] In 1947, Dai went to study in UK and received PhD from the University of Liverpool (advisor James Chadwick). In 1950s Dai went back to China (when Dai was abroad in UK, China already changed its regime from the Republic of China to the newly founded People's Republic of China). Dai was a researcher at the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in Beijing. Dai was the Vice-president, President, Honorary-president of the China Institute of Atomic Energy (). Dai was a Deputy-director of the State Nuclear Safety and Environmental Control Committee. Dai was a director of the Chinese Nuclear Physics Society (), an hononary-director of the Chinese Metrological Society (), and the deputy director-general of the Chinese Nuclear Power Society (). Dai was a senior academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Dai died in Beijing on 18 November 1990. Dai's early research focused on developing the nuclear detector of high accuracy, which is closely related to his doctoral study. He was a founding father of this field in China. Dai's team built the first neutron crystal spectrometer, the first neutron diffractometer, the first zero-energy thermal reactor, the first neutron transmutation doping of monocrystalline silicon, first large-sized electromagnetic separator in China. Dai is the father of Chinese nuclear microreactor, which made Chinese development of neclear-powered submarine become possible in 1960s and early 1970s (check Type 091).
