Lithuanian (Curonian) Protestants Lietuvininks, Lithuanians The Kurininkai (Curonians; German: Kuren; Lithuanian: Kurininkai; Latvian: Kursenieki) (sg. Kursenieks) are a nearly extinct Baltic ethnic group living along the Curonian Spit. "Kurininkai" refers only to inhabitants of Lithuania and former East Prussia that speak a Lithuanian language dialect. Autochthonous inhabitants of Palanga in Lithuania call themselves "Curonians" as well,[1] but in Lithuania they usually are counted as Latvians[citation needed]. Kurininkai/Kurzemnieki are often confused with the extinct Curonian Baltic tribe, as neighbouring ethnic groups called Kurininkai/Kurzemnieki as Curonians: in German, Latvian and Lithuanian, Kurininkai and the Curonian tribe are known by the same terms (Kuren, kuri and kuriai respectively). In scientific Lithuanian literature, the name kurininkai is used to designate them from the Curonian tribe. Simillary in Latvian kurzemnieki is used mostly exclusively by scientists to designate them from the Curonian tribe. On the other hand, Kurininkai should not be confused with Kurzemnieki, which are the geographical group of Latvians from Kurzeme. Kurininkai are often considered descendants of the extinct Curonian tribe. The Kurininkai/Kurzemnieki have never designated themselves as Latvians and their own language was called "Curonian language" (kurzemnieku valoda). From a linguistic point of view, it is a dialect of Latvian[citation needed]. In German and Latvian writings of the 19th century, Kurinikai sometimes are called "Prussian Latvians" (German: Preussische Letten; Latvian: Prsijas latviei)[citation needed]. Kurininkai were loyal to Germany and identified themselves as German citizens and ethnic Kurininkas.[citation needed] The origin of the Kurininkai is unclear. One version says that they are indigenous descendants of the Curonian tribe who lived there since antiquity, at least along the Curonian Spit.[2] During the conquest of the Old Prussians and Curonians by the Teutonic Knights, the area became nearly uninhabited. In the process of various migrations of the 14th-17th centuries,[3][4][5] Curonians from Courland settled near Memel, along the Curonian Spit, and in Sambia (all regions in East Prussia). They preserved the old self-designation of Curonians (kursi), while Curonians who stayed in Courland became Latvians. The Kurininkai were assimilated by Germans, except along the Curonian Spit where some still live. Until 1945, several places in Sambia were named after Kurininkai, including Cranzkuhren, Neukuhren, Gross Kuhren, and Klein Kuhren. In 1649 Kurininkai lived from Memel (Klaipda) to Danzig (Gdask). In the end of the 19th century the total number of Kurininkai was around 4,000 persons. Kurininkai were considered Latvians after World War I when Latvia gained independence from the Russian Empire[citation needed]. This consideration was based on linguistic arguments and was the rationale for Latvian claims over the Curonian Spit, Memel, and some other territories of East Prussia. Later these claims were removed. In 1923 the newly-created Memel Territory (Klaipda Region) separated the Curonian Spit in two parts. This separation interrupted contacts between Kurininkai. In 1933 Latvia tried to establish a cultural center for Kurininkai of the Curonian Spit where the majority of them lived, but was opposed by Lithuania, to which the Memel Territory belonged. Latvian books that were sent to Kurininkai were confiscated and accused of communist propaganda. Near the end of World War II, the majority of Kurininkai fled from the Red Army during the evacuation of East Prussia. Kurininkai that remained behind were subsequently expelled by the Soviet Union after the war and replaced with Russians and Lithuanians. Some Kurininkai managed to return to their homes after the war, but only 219 lived along the Curonian Spit in 1955. Many had German names such as Fritz or Hans, a cause for anti-German discrimination. Russian settlers called the Kurininkai fascists, while Lithuanian settlers called them Prussians. In the Lithuanian SSR, church services in German were banned. Because of this discrimination, many immigrated to West Germany in 1958, where the majority of Kurininkai now live. Neither Lithuania nor Russia has allowed the return to Kurininkai of property confiscated after World War II. Curonians are one of the Baltic tribes. Their Culture,religion and architecture is similar to those found in Germany and Sweden. Curonians are related with Lithuanians and Latvians. The Kurininkai were predominantly Lutheran[citation needed], like most former inhabitants of East Prussia, although some ancient pagan customs were preserved. Most Kurininkai were bilingual or even trilingual: the Curonian language was used within the family and while fishing, German was used in everyday communication, and the language of church services was German and Lithuanian. The Kurininkai were primarily fishermen. Some elements of cuisine are named after Kurininkai, for example Curonian coffee (Kurenkoffee); a drink made of vodka flavoured with coffee, honey and other ingredients was popular throughout East Prussia. The first who took an interest in Kurininkai culture and language was Paul Kwauka, a member of the separatist movement of Memel Territory. His book "Kurisches Worterbuch" is a highly valuable source of information.The work of describing their heritage is continued by one of the last remaining Curonians, Richard Pietsch.[6] The so-called New Curonian language (New Curonian: Kursenieku valoda; German: Nehrungskurisch) is spoken by the Kursenieki of the Curonian Spit, a thin strip of land stretching between southwestern Lithuania and Russia. In the process of various migrations of the 14th-17th centuries, Curonians (already speaking in Latvian) settled along the Curonian Spit in East Prussia and became known as the Kursenieki. The language was influenced by Old Prussian, Low German, High German and the Samogitian dialect respectively, and by the end of the 18th century new Curonian dialects had formed, with the dialect of the Curonian Spit being notably distinct, due to its isolation from the mainland. New Curonian vocabulary published in 1927 shows: 60% of Curonian words were the same as Latvian, 26% were loanwords from German (i.e. Low German and High German), and 13% from Lithuanian dialects. The New Curonian language is mutually intelligible with Latvian, especially with its southwestern dialects, and Latvians can communicate easily with Kursenieki today.[7] Before World War II, the New Curonian language was a sociolect of Kursenieki fishermen of the Curonian Spit. In other spheres of everyday life Kursenieki used the Low German and High German languages. The events of the first half of the 20th century, including the Soviet and German occupations of the Baltic states and later East Prussia, led to the near extinction of the language, making it severely endangered. Several remaining native speakers live in Germany, having been expelled in the ethnic cleansing that took place in East Prussia after World War II. The surnames of Kurininkai have various origins, including:
