Steptoe & Johnson PLLC is a regional law firm in the U.S. with 11 offices in West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Texas.[1] It is one of the largest law firms in the region employing over 230 lawyers in 30 practice areas. The firm has particular strengths in energy, labor, employment and litigation[2] and has been top-ranked by Chambers USA in the areas of Corporate/Commercial, Litigation/General Commercial, Real Estate, Natural Resources and Labor & Employment.[3] The firm was also ranked in the 100 largest U.S. practices in the areas of employment, energy, and insurance.[4][5][6] The origins of Steptoe & Johnson PLLC date back to 1913. The firm was established in Clarksburg, West Virginia by Philip P. Steptoe and Louis A. Johnson, distinguished graduates of the University of Virginia Law School. The two men met when Johnson, preparing to take his first case before the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, sought a mentor and approached Steptoe, an established attorney ten years his senior, who had a 'fine reputation as a low-key, methodical, and scholarly attorney.' They took an immediate liking to one another, complemented one another and attracted prominent clients. Born in 1877 in Brandy Station, Virginia, Philip P. Steptoe was the son of an Episcopal minister. He graduated from Virginia Law School in 1902 and soon became known as one of the leading chancery lawyers in West Virginia. Possessing a "keen analytical mind and sense of equality", Steptoe was considered quiet, reserved and very scholarly. Louis Arthur Johnson was born in Roanoke, Virginia in 1891. He was a heavyweight boxer and wrestler, graduated from Virginia Law School and traveled to West Virginia to launch his legal career. Known as "The Colonel", Johnson was a dignified, outgoing man. He served as the Assistant Secretary of War under President Franklin D. Roosevelt and was the Secretary of Defense under the President Harry S. Truman.[7] Steptoe & Johnson PLLC has 11 offices in the continental U.S.:[8]
