Flag of Italy (1861-1946) crowned.svg Italy Flag of Independent State of Croatia.svg Independent State of Croatia The Third Enemy Offensive (Serbo-Croatian: Trea neprijateljska ofenziva), codenamed Operation Trio, was a large-scale German-Italian-Ustaa offensive carried out against the Yugoslav Partisans and Chetniks in southeastern Bosnia, eastern Herzegovina, and Montenegro from March to June 1942.[1][2][3] Axis generals planned a series of operations at a conference in Opatija, with the goal of crushing large regions liberated by Tito's Partisans after the failure of the winter offensive. The codename Trio was given to the operation in eastern Bosnia and command was given to the staff of Kampfgruppe Bader. The offensive didn't start as planned, although it took long preparation. Without knowledge of Kampfgruppe Bader, the Ustae started their attack from Han Pijesak. While Italians were regrouping theirs divisions, the Ustaa "Black Legion" with three battalions started attacking from Han-Pijesak and captured Vlasenica on April 1, and eight days latter Bratunac and Srebrenica. On April 8 Black Legion units came into heavy fighting with Bosnian Chetniks near the Drina river. The Germans started their advance on April 22 towards blocked Rogatica and pushed the Partisan forces back. Only after five days of fighting the Germans entered Rogatica, and afterwards Pra and Gorade. The Italian 5th Mountain Division "Pusteria" captured ajii on April 23 and soon reached Gorade. The 1st Mountain Division "Taurinense" captured Trnovo as well as reaching and blocking Kalinovik, where it made contact with elements of the 22 Infantry Division Cacciatori delle Alpi. However, due to the successful rearguard-actions of the Partisans, Italian forces didn't arrive into eastern Bosnia on schedule which allowed the former easier maneuvering and allowed for a possibility of retreat south of the Kalinovik-Foa line. Parts of the 5th Mountain Division "Pusteria" captured Foa on May 10, from where the Partisan Supreme Headquarters south with the 1st and 2nd Proletarian Brigade. The offensive resulted in the dissolution of the formations of the Partisan-controlled Volunteer Army of Yugoslavia, many units of which defected to the Chetniks by violent command-coups, resulting in the death of the Partisan commanders that didn't escape. The new Chetnik command quickly made treaties with the Germans promising aid against the Partisans in exchange for weapons and munitions. The Partisan Supreme Command therefore disbanded the Volunteer Army of Yugoslavia and formed the People's Liberation Army of Yugoslavia. The strategic results were very significant as the Partisan troops were forced to march westwards, which resulted in the destruction of numerous Axis communication lines as well as allowing for the merge with the numerous Partisan units in western Bosnia, and with the forces of the main Croatian Partisan Headquarters. 1941: 1942: 1943: 1944: 1945: Macedonia: Slovenia: Strategic bombing:
