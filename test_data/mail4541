The John Leland Center for Theological Studies is a Christian institution of higher education, comprising a seminary and a school of ministry.[1] The center offers classes in Falls Church, Virginia, and at several satellite locations throughout Virginia.[1] Leland is partnered with the Baptist General Association of Virginia[2] and the District of Columbia Baptist Convention,[3] though the center has ties with a range of denominations and churches.[1][4] Leland is a member of the Washington Theological Consortium.[5] The center's namesake, John Leland, was an 18th and 19th century Baptist minister in the United States who was a proponent of the separation of church and state.[4] At a 1997 Baptist World Alliance meeting, several Baptist leaders discussed developing the Washington Metropolitan Area's first Baptist seminary.[6][7] These individuals resolved to create the center which began offering classes the next year.[6][7] Randel Everett, the center's first president, stepped down in late 2006.[4][8] Mark J. Olson became Leland's second president in 2007.[9] Leland Seminary offers the center's graduate courses.[10] The seminary is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS).[11][12] The seminary offers the following ATS-approved degrees: Master of Divinity, Master of Arts in Christian Leadership, and Master of Theological Studies.[11][13] The seminary also offers a Graduate Certificate in Theological Studies.[10] Leland School of Ministry, based at the center's Hampton Roads, Virginia satellite, offers the center's undergraduate courses and non-traditional programs, including a diploma in theology program.[14] The school partners with Averett University and Hampton University to allow students seeking a bachelor's degree to transfer Leland course credits into those universities' degree programs.[15][16]
