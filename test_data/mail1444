Postern of Fate is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie that was first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club in October 1973[1] and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company later in the same year[2][3]. The UK edition retailed at 2.00[1] and the US edition at $6.95[3]. The book features her detectives Tommy and Tuppence Beresford and is the detectives' last appearance. It is the final novel Christie ever wrote, but it was not the last to be published. The title comes from the poem Gates of Damascus by James Elroy Flecker. The poem is also referenced in the short story The Gate of Baghdad in the 1934 collection Parker Pyne Investigates. Now in their seventies (though the authoress never states their age clearly), Tommy and Tuppence move to a quiet English village, looking forward to a peaceful retirement. But, as they soon discover, their rambling old house holds secrets. Who is Mary Jordan? And why has someone left a code message in an old book about her 'unnatural' death? Once more, ingenuity and insight are called for as they are drawn into old mysteries and new dangers. Most critics remarked how noticeable Agatha Christie's old age is in this book. For example the main characters Tommy and Tuppence seem to have completely forgotten in one chapter what they discussed just a chapter before. Some conversations seem to be repeated again and again, before any action takes place. Some puzzles which are obvious and easy to solve for the reader take various chapter to be tackled by the main characters. Nevertheless, the reader is able to follow the main story line. Maurice Richardson in The Observer of November 11, 1973 was positive in his review: "Now in their seventies, the Beresfords, that amateur detective couple of hers whom some of us found too sprightly for comfort, have acquired a Proustian complexity. A code message in an Edwardian children's book puts them on to the murder of a governess involved in a pre-1914 German spy case. Past and present go on interlocking impressively. Despite political naivety; this is a genuine tour de force with a star part for Hannibal, the Manchester Terrier."[4] Robert Barnard: "The last book Christie wrote. Best (and easily) forgotten."[5] Postern of Fate has been criticized as of lower quality than the bulk of Christie's output. According to The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English, this novel is one of the "execrable last novels" where Christie "loses her grip altogether".[6] The book has many references to other Tommy and Tuppence books as well as cultural references. We learn that Tuppence and Tommy's twin daughter Deborah is now mother of twins herself, that the adopted daughter Betty lives in Kenya and that the wife of Albert, the loyal valet, has recently passed away. Also Mr. Robinson, the "yellow, big man" from "Passenger To Frankfurt", appears here.
