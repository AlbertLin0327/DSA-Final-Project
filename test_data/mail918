The Oku Volcanic Field or Oku Massif is group of volcanoes based on a swell in the Cameroon Volcanic Line, located in the Oku region of the Western High Plateau of Cameroon.[1] The Mount Oku stratovolcano rises to 3,011m above sea level.[2] The massif has a diameter of almost 100km and contains four major stratovolcanoes: Mount Oku, Mount Babanki 15km SW of Oku, Nyos and Nkambe. Rocks in the massif have ages from 24.9 to 22.1 million years ago, but more recent activity has occurred.[3] The massif is composed of rhyolitic and trachytic rock, and contains many maars and basaltic cinder cones.[2] The Oku Volcanic Field includes two crater lakes, Lake Nyos to the north and Lake Monoun to the south. On 15 August 1984, an earthquake and landslide triggered a major release of carbon dioxide from Lake Monoun, killing several people.[2] Lake Nyos is inside a maar formed by an explosion about 400 years ago, and is about 1,800m wide and 208m deep. There is a low-temperature reservoir of free carbon dioxide below the lake bottom, which seeps into the lake through a volcanic pipe.[4] On 21 August 1986, Lake Nyos released a massive amount of carbon dioxide which killed at least 1,700 people by suffocation, possibly triggered by a force 5 earthquake along the Foumban Shear Zone, which runs under the massif.[5] Coordinates: 6200N 10400E / 6.333333N 10.666667E / 6.333333; 10.666667
