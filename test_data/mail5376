Heart of Fire is third single by the band Innerpartysystem from their debut self-titled album.[1] The song was first released (in an earlier form) with the band's debut EP in early 2007. The single was released with five other tracks (being labeled as an EP but sold as a single) as download-only in the United Kingdom. The band's videographer Stephan Penta described the single release as "the United Kingdom's release of the band's debut EP"[2] which contain four tracks available on this release (the excluded being "Heart That Heals" and the album version of "Heart of Fire"). The song "Heart That Heals" was previously only available to stream from the band's Purevolume page. The original EP version of the song was played during the MTV VMAs in September 2007 and is also featured on the video game Burnout Paradise.[3] The music video for "Heart of Fire" was released on 7 April 2009 and was directed and produced by Stephen Penta, who has produced all of the current music videos for the band. The video features the band's lead singer Patrick Nissley and model Lyssa Roberts as well as live clips from a concert in the O2 Academy Islington, London on the 5th February 2009. The video also features several flash pictures of the band during their touring cycle over the past couple of years, as well as time-lapse photography. A director's cut of the video was also planned along with the original release but was not finished in time and has yet to be released. The tracklist below[4] is the only tracklist listed for the single, the "The Lovers Dancing (Remix)" is the same track as "Lovers Dancing (Remix)" which appears on the band's EP The Download EP.
