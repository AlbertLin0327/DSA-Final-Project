SM U-20 or U-XX was the lead boat of the U-20class of submarines or U-boats built for and operated by the Austro-Hungarian Navy (German: Kaiserliche und Knigliche Kriegsmarine or K.u.K. Kriegsmarine) during the First World War. The design for U-20 was based on submarines of the Royal Danish Navy's Havmanden class (three of which had been built in Austria-Hungary), and was largely obsolete by the beginning of the war. U-20 was just over 127 feet (39m) long and was armed with two bow torpedo tubes, a deck gun, and a machine gun. U-20 had no wartime successes and was sunk in early July 1918 by the Italian submarine F-12. The wreck of U-20 was located in 1962 and salvaged. A portion of her conning tower is on display in a military museum in Vienna. When it became apparent to the Austro-Hungarian Navy that the First World War would not be a short war,[1] they moved to bolster their U-boat fleet by seizing the plans for Denmark's Havmanden class submarines,[7] three of which had been built at Whitehead & Co. in Fiume.[6] Although the Austro-Hungarian Navy was not happy with the design, which was largely obsolete,[8][9] it was the only design for which plans were available and which could be begun immediately in domestic shipyards.[9] The Austro-Hungarian Navy unenthusiastically placed orders for U-20 and her three sister boats on 27 March 1915.[1] U-20 was one of two boats of the class to be built at the Pola Navy Yard.[7] Due to demands by the Hungarian government,[1] subcontracts for the class were divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms,[2] but this politically expedient solution worsened technical problems with the design and resulted in numerous modifications and delays for the class in general.[7] U-20 was an ocean-going submarine that displaced 173 tonnes (191short tons) surfaced and 210 tonnes (231short tons) submerged and was designed for a complement of 18. She was 127feet 2inches (38.76m) long with a beam of 13 feet (4.0m) and a draft of 9 feet (2.7m). For propulsion, she featured a single propeller shaft, a single 450bhp (340kW) diesel engine for surface running, and a single 160shp (120kW) electric motor for submerged travel.[2] She was capable of 12 knots (22km/h) while surfaced and 9 knots (17km/h) while submerged. Although there is no specific notation of a range for U-20, the Havmanden class, upon which the U-20 class was based, had a range of 1,400 nautical miles (2,600km) at 10 knots (19km/h), surfaced, and 23 nautical miles (43km) at 8 knots (15km/h) submerged.[6] U-20 was armed with two 45cm (17.7in) torpedo tubes located in the front and carried a complement of two torpedoes. She was also equipped with a 66mm/26 (2.6in) deck gun and an 8mm (0.31in) machine gun.[2] U-20 was laid down on 29 September 1915,[3] six months after she was ordered,[1] and was launched on 18 September 1916.[2] Upon completion, U-20 began diving trials. On her 15 March 1917 trial, she was accidentally rammed by Admiral Spaun in the Fasana Channel. The collision with the Austro-Hungarian light cruiser twisted U-20's periscope, extensively damaged the conning tower, and knocked off her deck gun. After seven months of reconstruction, U-20 was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 20 October.[3] After initially operating out of Pola, U-20 was transferred to Trieste in February 1918. Over the next three months, the U-boat patrolled in the northern Adriatic between the Tagliamento estuary and Venice. U-20 had an encounter with an enemy submarine on 7 April but was not able to successfully launch an attack.[3] On 3 July, Linienschiffsleutnant Ludwig Mller sailed U-20 out from Trieste for the Gulf of Venice. A day later, U-20 was spotted by the Italian submarine F-12, which was on patrol in the northern Adriatic. F-12 initially pursued U-20 underwater, and then on the surface. At a range of 650 yards (590m), F-12 torpedoed U-20 at position 4529N 1305E / 45.483N 13.083E / 45.483; 13.083 (SM U-20), sinking her with all hands. There was no wreckage on the surface, only an oil slick.[4][Note 1] Like all of her sister boats,[7] U-20 had no wartime successes.[5] In mid 1962, the wreck of U-20 was discovered in the northern Adriatic. Italian salvage crews raised the boat's rear portion on 22 July and her front section on 21 November.[4] The conning tower and a small midships section of U-20 were donated to the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum in Vienna, where they are on display, while the rest of the boat was scrapped.[7] The remains of the crewmen were buried on the grounds of the Theresian Military Academy at Wiener Neustadt.[10] U-20  U-21  U-22  U-23
