The Montgomery Advertiser is a daily newspaper located in Montgomery, Alabama. It was founded in 1829. The newspaper began publication in 1829 as The Planter's Gazette. It became the Montgomery Advertiser in 1833. In 1903, R.F. Hudson, a young Alabama newspaperman, joined the staff of the Advertiser and rose through the ranks of the newspaper. Hudson was central to improving the financial situation of the newspaper, and by 1924 he owned 10% of its stock. Hudson purchased the remaining shares of the company in 1935, and five years later he bought The Alabama Journal, a competitor founded in Montgomery in 1889. Ownership of the Advertiser subsequently passed from Hudson's heirs to Carmage Walls (1963), through Multimedia Corp. (1968) to Gannett (1995).[1] The Alabama Journal would continue to exist as a local afternoon paper until April 16, 1993 when it published its last issue before merging with the morning Advertiser.[2] In October 2008, the Advertiser, which describes itself as having been "the leading newspaper of the new Confederate states,"[1] endorsed the presidential candidacy of Illinois African-American Senator Barack Obama.[3] Of the 25 daily newspapers published in Alabama, the Advertiser has the fourth highest daily circulation.[4] The newspaper has earned several awards, including three Pulitzer Prizes: The Argus, Brighton  The Bolton News  Telegraph & Argus, Bradford  Evening Gazette, Colchester  Daily Echo, Bournemouth  Dorset Echo  Echo, Basildon, Essex  Evening Times  The Herald, Glasgow  Lancashire Telegraph  Oxford Mail  The Northern Echo  The Press, York  Southern Daily Echo, Southampton  South Wales Argus  Swindon Advertiser  Worcester News
