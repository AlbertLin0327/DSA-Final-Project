Torrid Zone is a 1940 adventure film starring James Cagney, Ann Sheridan and Pat O'Brien.[1][2] Steve Case (Pat O'Brien) has to deal with trouble at his tropical fruit company's Central American banana plantation. A revolutionary, Rosario La Mata (George Tobias), is stirring up unrest among the workers, and the only man who can handle the situation, foreman Nick Butler (James Cagney), has just quit. Steve manages to persuade Nick to stick around (for a big bonus). Adding to the complications is Lee Donley (Ann Sheridan), a woman whom Steve has ordered out of the region for causing a different kind of trouble among the men. The film borrowed plot elements from 'The Front Page' and 'Red Dust'. And ended with Cagney saying to Sheridan "You and that 14-carat oomph", a studio 'in-joke' in reference to Sheridan's title as the 'Oomph Girl'.
