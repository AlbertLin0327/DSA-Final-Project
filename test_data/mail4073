This is an overview of the postage stamps and postal history of Free City of Danzig . Danzig, now Gdansk, is a Polish city on the Baltic coast. It used to be a Free City of Danzig with its own stamps. The first stamps of Danzig were overprinted German stamps issued on 14 June 1920. The first stamps of the Danzig Free State appeared in January 1921 and continued in use until the outbreak of World War II in 1939.[1] At that time the Free City was annexed by the Third Reich. A Polish Post Office operated in the harbour of Danzig (see Polish Post Office in Danzig). This used Polish stamps overprinted PORT GDANSK.
