It was the band's most commercially successful release, and produced their biggest chart hit, "A Penny More". In 1996, the album disappeared from Canadian record stores after the band's label, FRE Records, filed for bankruptcy. Although the band pursued litigation to win back the master tapes, they were not successful. As a result, in 1999, they released an alternate version of the album, Still Restless: The Lost Tapes.
