The Australian Saloon Car Series is an Australian motor racing series for drivers of Group 3K Saloon Cars.[1] The Saloon Car category was devised as a low cost amateur sedan racing formula which would potentially replace the ageing HQ Holden category. The original regulations were focused around large Australian sedans of early 1990s vintage with eligibility limited to VN and VP series Holden Commodores and the EA and EB series Ford Falcons [2] The regulations limited the cars to six cylinder versions rather than the V8 engined models, as the latter might make the category too similar to Commodore Cup. The cars are slightly modified from their road going versions, with an emphasis on safety for racing.[2] The Saloon Car category made its debut at the 2000 Adelaide 500 meeting in what was the first round of a three round series.[2] The annual series was officially sanctioned by the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport from 2002 [2] and state level series have also evolved in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. The category has been particularly successful in Western Australia. The first major change in the category regulations saw an update in vehicle eligibility for the 2006 season with the Holden VT Commodore and the Ford AU Falcon models added to the field.[2] The newer models proved instantly more competitive and the older cars soon slipped down the field and were relegated to class results or state level series. In the same year the series was granted National Championship status by the CAMS and officially became the Australian Saloon Car Championship.[2] [3] After a second year as a Championship in 2007 [4] it reverted to its National Series status for 2008.[5] The categorys most successful driver has been Bruce Heinrich who has won the national series five times, including the two Australian Saloon Car Championship titles.[2]
