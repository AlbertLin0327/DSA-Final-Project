Jiuniang (, also called lozo, , or jingmji, ) is a sweet, soup- or pudding-like dish in Chinese cuisine made by fermenting glutinous rice with a starter () containing yeast and Aspergillus oryzae. It was first developed as a by-product of mijiu production. Although jiuniang is similar to an unfiltered rice wine in that it is mildly alcoholic, it contains whole rice grains and is often made with Sweet Osmanthus flowers; if made with Sweet Osmanthus flowers the dish is called guihua jiuniang (). Jiuniang is often served together with small unfilled tangyuan during the Dongzhi Festival, a Chinese winter holiday dedicated to the ancestors. When served in such a manner it is called jiuniang tangyuan () or "jiuniang yuanzi" (), or, with Sweet Osmanthus, guihua jiuniang tangyuan (). All forms of jiuniang are typically eaten with a spoon. It is very similar to the southern Vietnamese dish cm ru, which usually contains balls of rice. It is also similar to the Korean sikhye and Japanese amazake, although these are a bit thinner in texture and considered drinks rather than soups or puddings.
