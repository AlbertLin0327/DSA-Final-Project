Raag Darbari is an Hindi novel written by Sri Lal Sukla, an author known for his social and political satire. He was awarded the Sahitya Academy Award, the highest Indian literary award, in 1970 for this novel. The novel highlights the failing values present in post-Independence Indian society. It exposes the helplessness of intellectuals in the face of a strong and corrupt nexus between criminals, businessmen, police and politicians. The novel is narrated from the point of view of Ranganath, a research student in history, who comes to live with his uncle, Vaidyaji, in a village named Shivpal Ganj for a few months. He learns how his uncle uses all the village institutions  the village school, the village panchayat (a local elected body), the local government offices for his political purpose. The conduct of his uncle and the petty village politicians is in stark contrast to the ideals that Ranganath has learnt to aspire to during his university education. The villagers take pride in calling themselves 'gunjahe', originating from 'ganj' of 'Shivpal ganj'. Following is a list of some of the important characters in the book: Vaidyaji: He is the mastermind behind all village politics. Very articulate in framing his sentences and choosing his words, Vaidyaji is also officially the manager of the local college. Ruppan babu: The younger son of Vaidyaji and the leader of college students Ruppan babu has remained in the 10th grade the past many years, in the same college in which his father is manager.Ruppan babu is actively involved in all village politics and is well respected in the village community due to his illustrious parentage. Towards the end of the novel a gradual change can be observed in his behaviour which can be attributed due to influence of Ranganath. Badri pehelwaan: Elder brother of Ruppan babu. Badri keeps himself away from his fathers involvements and keeps himself busy in his body building exercises and taking care of his 'paalak baalak'(a term widely used for blind followers of a person - protege in refined English) Ranganath: An MA in History, Ranganath is the nephew to Vaidyaji. He has come to Shivpalganj on a vacation for about 56 months. It appears that the author wants to give the view of the pathetic condition in the villages through the eyes of an educated person. Chhote pehelwaan: one of the 'paalak baalaks' of Badri pehelwaan, Chotte is an active participant in village politics and is a frequent participant in the meetings summoned by Vaidyaji. Principal sahib: As the name denotes, Principal sahib is the principal of the college. His relations with other members of the staff in colLege, forms an important part of the plot. Khanna master: One of the teachers in the college, he is up in arms against Principal sahab. Jognath: the local goon, almost always drunk; speaks a unique language by inserting an "F" in between every 2 syllables. Sanichar: His real name is Mangaldas but people call him Sanichar. He is a servant to Vaidyaji.He was later made the puppet pradhaan (leader) of village with the use of political tactics by Vaidyaji. Langad: He is a representative of the hapless common man who has to bend in front of the corrupt government system even to get small things done. Based on Girish Rastogi's[1] adaptation of Raag Darbari, Bahroop Arts Group[2] staged 'Ranganath Ki Waapsi', directed by Rajesh Singh, a noted alumnus of National School of Drama, New Delhi, India on 18th November 09 at Alliance Franaise de NEW DELHI[3]. It was a wonderful production, with sheer brilliance of acting and music bringing in the rustic milieu of the novel, furthermore it seems as if the characters from Shukla's Novel are 'live' in front of you.
