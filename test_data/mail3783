Gun Aramaic is an album by Muslimgauze. Allmusic gave a positive review to Gun Aramaic and commented that, "a little more than most Muslimgauze releases, Gun Aramaic is very environmental in terms of its composition; the reliance on conversational snippets throughout almost turns the album into a soundtrack for a non-existent film."[1]
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
