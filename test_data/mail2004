The 121st SS-Standarte was a short lived regimental command of the Allgemeine-SS that existed for two months in the year 1940. The unit was ordered formed by the SS-Hauptamt in September 1940 with its headquarters in the city of Strasbourg. SS officer Hans-Gnther Holzel was selected to be the Standarte's first commander but, for reasons which were never documented, Holzel's orders were canceled and the unit was declared disbanded. In November of the same year, the SS ordered that the 122nd SS-Standarte be activated, also in the city of Strasbourg. The 122nd Standarte persevered until the end of World War II and was disbanded upon the fall of Nazi Germany in May 1945.
