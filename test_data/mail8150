"Thank You for the Heartbreak" is a song recorded by English girl group Sugababes for their seventh studio album, Sweet 7 (2010). It was written by Ryan Tedder, Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen and Claude Kelly, and produced by Eriksen and Hermansen under their production team name Stargate. "Thank You for the Heartbreak" is an electropop song that has an "80s" feel and sounds "distinctively Sugababes". Music critics gave favorable reviews to the song, and many noted it to be a highlight of the album, with some praising the group's identifiable sound on the track. "Thank You for the Heartbreak" was written by Ryan Tedder, Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen and Claude Kelly, for the group's seventh studio album, Sweet 7 (2010).[1] The song was produced by Eriksen and Hermansen, collectively known by their production name Stargate, who have also worked with artists including Beyonc Knowles and Rihanna. It was also recorded by Eriksen at Roc The Mic Studios in New York City, where Sugababes had visited after signing a contract with Jay-Z's record label Roc Nation.[2] The mixing process of the song was completed by Phil Tan at Soapbox Studios in Atlanta, GA; Josh Houghkirk served as the mixing assistant. Additional vocal mixing was done by Jeremy Wheatley for 365 Artists at TwentyOne Studios in the group's hometown, London. The song's engineering process was undertaken by Carlos Oyanedel in collaboration with Damien Lewis, while the instruments were provided by Stargate.[1] Additional vocal production was completed by Mike Stevens and Marcus Byrne; Richard Edgeler served as an assistant.[1] In an interview for Digital Spy, group member Amelle Berrabah said: "'Thank You For The Heartbreak' is definitely a song that we [Sugababes] love", and named it a potential single to be released from the album.[3] "Thank You for the Heartbreak" is an electropop song that has a length of three minutes and forty seconds.[4] David Balls of Digital Spy described it as a "snappy electropop number"; he also noted its potential to "have slotted quite nicely" onto Sugababes' fifth studio album, Change (2007).[5] Balls also went on to say that "there's a definite 80s feel to it", despite sounding "distinctively Sugababes."[5] During an interview with Sugababes, Balls suggested that there was a "potential lyrical mishap" in the song's lyric, 'dancing off my tears', on which Heidi Range replied that "If people want to sing that when we perform it, well, we won't complain!"[6] Robbie Daw of Idolator wrote that the track is "less of a stab at American radio-friendly R&B and more of a return to what Britain's 'babes have traditionally excelled at", which according to him is "taking their sass and snappy tell-offs to the dance floor."[7] "Thank You for the Heartbreak" received generally favorable reviews from most music critics. Nick Levine of Digital Spy said that the song "displays the Sugababes spunk of old" in comparison to the other "characterless" tracks on the album.[8] In an album review for Sweet 7, Thomas H Green of The Daily Telegraph listed the song in his "Download this" category.[9] Lauren Murphy of Entertainment Ireland described it as a "minor saving grace" and "very likeable" in comparison to the other "mediocre" tracks on the album.[10] David Balls of Digital Spy noted that the song "suggests the girls [Sugababes] extracted maximum benefit from their recording sessions in LA earlier this year", and that the group did not "stray too far from their comfort zone". Balls also described "Thank You for the Heartbreak", as well as the album's second single "About a Girl", as a track that is both "fresh-sounding" and "packed with the attitude that always made the group stand out."[5] Robbie Daw of Idolator gave a very positive review for the song, who suggested that it should have been released as the album's third single, as opposed to "Wear My Kiss", which he described as "not the most inspired song to spring forth from the ever-changing trios canon."[7] Citing reasons for this, Daw said that the song is "tight enough jam to possibly sway some of the girls' detractors who've not gotten over the groups series of lineup changes", describing this as "the power of disco."[7] Shaun Kitchener of Trash Lounge was critical of the song; he wrote that in "Thank You for the Heartbreak", as well as the album's third single "Wear My Kiss", Sugababes find themselves "lacking in originality and fading into the blur of 95% of other female-driven pop-Rn'B establishments."[11] Kitchener also criticised Tedder, the song's co-writer, by writing "hang your head in shame, Ryan Tedder."[11] Credits adapted from the liner notes of Sweet 7, Island Records.[1]
