He worked until 1987, when he rose to become a lineman. His elder brother was also a telecom officer.[1] Asokan was always interested in acting and was an amateur theatre actor. His style of comedy was watched by Malayalam movie director Siddique during a popular celebration day event. Siddique was impressed and cast him in his first movie, Ramji Rao Speaking. Asokan is not a direct comedian like Jagathy Sreekumar, Innocent or Salim Kumar. He mostly acts as the hero's sidekick.
