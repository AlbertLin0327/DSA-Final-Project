Ryan Michael Carter (born August 3, 1983) is a professional ice hockey player currently playing for the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League (NHL). From 200104 Ryan Carter played for the Green Bay Gamblers of the USHL. From 200406 Carter played for Minnesota State University, Mankato. In 2006 Carter signed a professional contract with the Anaheim Ducks. He played for the Ducks AHL affiliate at the time, the Portland Pirates where he had 16 goals and 20 assists for 36 points in 76 games. Carter was called up to the Anaheim Ducks from the Portland Pirates for the 2007 playoff run and played four games. The Ducks would defeat the Ottawa Senators in the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals, and Carter's name was engraved on the Stanley Cup.[1] On February 8, 2008 during the 200708 NHL season, Carter scored his first and second NHL goal against Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils. Later that season, Carter was injured in bizarre fashion when his right arm went through a photographer's hole on the glass. Carter had surgery on his right wrist, and was out for six weeks.[2] On April 29, 2008, Carter re-signed a three-year, $2 million contract with the Ducks.[3] During the 200809 NHL season, Carter switched to the number 20 jersey. He became the first player to wear the number 20 in Anaheim since fan-favorite Steve Rucchin. Carter played 48 games during the regular season, often being a healthy scratch, and finished with nine points. In a first-round playoff game against the Sharks on April 25, 2009, Carter scored his first NHL playoff point with a goal. Carter was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes on November 23, 2010, for minor league forwards Matt Kennedy and Stefan Chaput.[4] On February 24, 2011, Carter was traded to the Florida Panthers along with a 5th round pick in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft for Cory Stillman.[5] On July 9, 2011, Carter signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Florida Panthers.[6] On October 26, 2011, Carter was claimed off of waivers by the New Jersey Devils.
