BBYO is a peer-led, Zionist and pluralist youth movement. It is open to all Jewish youth between the ages of 13-18 that want to take part in different activities. The members are encouraged to play an active role in both the Jewish and general community. This proactive approach creates confident and competent leaders who make BBYO unique.[1] In 1924, a group of boys formed a fraternity in Omaha, Nebraska. The society was named the Aleph Zadik Aleph (AZA, standing for Ahava Tzadakah Achdu't, meaning brotherhood, charity and unity. The B'nai B'rith Youth Organisation formed from the AZA, incorporating the B'nai B'rith Girls (BBG) in 1927. The first BBYO chapter established in England and Ireland (District 15) was Leeds, in 1940. Now there are over 10 chapters in District 15. Today, BBYO is the world's largest Jewish youth group, with over 35 000 members in more than 1000 chapters. Over half a million teenagers have been part of BBYO, in all parts of the world.[2][3] The whole district is then led by the National Exec which is elected by the members at an event called National Veida in August. The National exec is made up of people usually entering year 12 (aged 1617). The National Exec supports the chapters as well as running national events for the members. BBYO also has a Youth Direction, Education and Development co-ordinator and an Admin who work in the office to support the National Exec. BBYO bogrim make up the youth commission and they support the chapters and the national exec in an advisory role. BBYO runs a number of events through the year. They are themed and combine social, educational and leadership activities. BBYO runs winter and summer camps, a new members weekend, national weekends, and Israel and International Programmes too.[4] Birmingham is the newest chapter to be reformed having been set up again in 2006. Although it was one of the first few chapters to ever be formed in the UK, the chapter only restarted again recently. The chapter has a fantastic family atmosphere due to the tight knit Jewish Community in Birmingham. A chapter by the seaside for the great Jewish community in Bournemouth, hold chapter meetings weekly One of the largest chapters in BBYO, getting on average 35 members a week. Radlett is the now the biggest chapter in England getting more and more members every week. Deganya chapter is known for its friendly atmosphere and with new members every week, this chapter is now one of the biggest. Kadima is BBYO's new chapter designed especially for sixth formers. It meets roughly once a month for mature, informative and fun programmes run by different committees each time. It is a chapter for 16-18 year olds who often have come from other chapters previously but also welcomes any new older members, it is normally located at Edgware Syngogue however the venue could change, for information on when and where the next meeting is please contact the office. In the UK and Ireland each chapter has up to six or seven executive members. These are the members that are in charge of running the programs and looking after all the other members in that chapter. As BBYO is peer-led the exec positions are taken up by the older members of the group usually aged between 15-17. There are six to seven (depending on the chapter) positions all with different roles and jobs to do to keep everything going and in order. The order is as follows: Judaism and Zionism Awareness Officer There are quite a few events on the BBYO calendar. These events go on though out the whole year there are events in winter and summer. As Tour happens every year each every person comes back with lots of photos and videos from the trip. One person created a youtube page dedicated to their tour photos and images. As of 20/07/09 this page has 68 uploaded videos, 13 of them being slideshows.[5] In Early June 2009, BBYO UK updated their website and got a complete new look for the site. The site is not finished yet, however updates are always available, and the site is going well so far. This page is also to be updated.
