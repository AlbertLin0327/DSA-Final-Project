The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF; f_r(\omega_i , \omega_o)) is a four-dimensional function that defines how light is reflected at an opaque surface. The function takes an incoming light direction, \omega_i, and outgoing direction, \omega_o, both defined with respect to the surface normal n, and returns the ratio of reflected radiance exiting along \omega_o to the irradiance incident on the surface from direction \omega_i. Note that each direction \omega is itself parameterized by azimuth angle \phi and zenith angle \theta, therefore the BRDF as a whole is 4-dimensional. The BRDF has units sr1, with steradians (sr) being a unit of solid angle. The BRDF was first defined by Fred Nicodemus around 1965.[1] The modern definition is: f_r(\omega_i, \omega_o)=\frac{dL_r(\omega_o)}{dE_i(\omega_i)}=\frac{dL_r(\omega_o)}{L_i(\omega_i)\cos\theta_i\,d\omega_i} where L is the radiance, E is the irradiance, and \theta_i is the angle made between \omega_i and the surface normal, n. The Spatially Varying Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (SVBRDF) is a 6-dimensional function, f_r(\omega_i,\omega_o,\mathbf{x}), where \mathbf{x} describes a 2D location over an object's surface. The Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF) is appropriate for modeling non-flat surfaces, and has the same parameterization as the SVBRDF; however in contrast, the BTF includes non-local scattering effects like shadowing, masking, interreflections or subsurface scattering. The functions defined by the BTF at each point on the surface are thus called Apparent BRDFs. The Bidirectional Surface Scattering Reflectance Distribution Function (BSSRDF), is a further generalized 8-dimensional function S(\mathbf{x}_i,\omega_i,\mathbf{x}_o,\omega_o) in which light entering the surface may scatter internally and exit at another location. In all these cases, the dependence on wavelength has been ignored and binned into RGB channels. In reality, the BRDF is wavelength dependent, and to account for effects such as iridescence or luminescence the dependence on wavelength must be made explicit: f_r(\lambda_i,\omega_i,\lambda_o,\omega_o). Physically based BRDFs have additional properties, including, The BRDF is a fundamental radiometric concept, and accordingly is used in computer graphics for photorealistic rendering of synthetic scenes (see the Rendering equation), as well as in computer vision for many inverse problems such as object recognition. BRDFs can be measured directly from real objects using calibrated cameras and lightsources;[2] however, many phenomenological and analytic models have been proposed including the Lambertian reflectance model frequently assumed in computer graphics. Some useful features of recent models include: Wojciech et al. found that interpolating between measured samples produced realistic results and was easy to understand.[3] Traditionally, BRDF measurements were taken for a specific lighting and viewing direction at a time using gonioreflectometers. Unfortunately, using such a device to densely measure the BRDF is very time consuming. One of the first improvements on these techniques used a half-silvered mirror and a digital camera to take many BRDF samples of a planar target at once. Since this work, many researchers have developed other devices for efficiently acquiring BRDFs from real world samples, and it remains an active area of research. There is an alternative way to measure BRDF based on HDR images. The standard algorithm is to measure the BRDF point cloud from images and optimize it by one of the BRDF models.[14]
