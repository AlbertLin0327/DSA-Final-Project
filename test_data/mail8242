Operation Shining Express was the July, 2003 deployment of a U.S. Naval task force based around the amphibious ship USS Kearsarge to rescue embassy personnel and American citizens from Liberia's civil war. The deployment was announced on 13 June 2003. It followed the successful 1990 rescue effort in Liberia, Operation Sharp Edge.
