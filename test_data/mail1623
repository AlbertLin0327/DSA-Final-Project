Philip William Otterbein Martin Boehm Jacob Albright Christian Newcomer John Seybert Andrew Zeller Joseph Hoffman The Church of the United Brethren in Christ (New Constitution) is that part (the majority) of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ which adopted a new constitution in the late-19th century. A minority of the Church (led by Bishop Milton Wright) opposed the adoption of a new constitution, walking out of the General Conference and forming a rival denomination (for a while calling itself the Church of the United Brethren in Christ (Old Constitution)). The majority branch of the U.B. Church (i.e., those adopting the new constitution) ultimately merged with the Evangelical Church in 1946 to form the Evangelical United Brethren Church.
