Manuel Flores Mora (19231984) was a Uruguayan journalist and politician representing the Colorado Party. A direct descendent of 19th century President Venancio Flores, Flores worked in his youth for a range of newspapers, including the daily Accin where he became political editor and later deputy editor. He stood for election and in 1954 became a Deputy, serving three terms until rising to the post of Senator in 1966. A year later he was named Minister of Cattle Ranching and Agriculture in the cabinet of President scar Diego Gestido, a position he maintained into the presidency of Jorge Pacheco Areco until June 1968 when he left due to differences over security issues. He opposed Pacheco from the Senate until 1971 when he ran for the presidency and vice-presidency simultaneously, with Amlcar Vasconcellos as his running mate. Neither slate attracted sufficient support, however, and he subsequently lost his seat in the Senate. After the coup d'tat of June 27, 1973, he became an active opponent of the new military rgime. He joined the editorial board of El Da and in the last years of the dictatorship wrote articles for the magazine Jaque (which he co-founded in 1983) denouncing the wide ranging abuses committed by the military in power. He died in 1984 in his 61st year, just as parliamentary democracy was returning to Uruguay. His son, Manuel Flores Silva, took his seat in the new Senate. Press Archive (Spanish).
