The Western Region Football League is an Australian rules football semi-professional league, based in the western suburbs of Melbourne, for both seniors and juniors. The league was formed in 1931, as the Footscray District Football League. In 1988 the league absorbed clubs from the West Suburban Football League and in 2000, to reflect the fact that the league had expanded across the western suburbs, it changed its name to the Western Region Football League. The leagues headquarters are at Yarraville Oval which is the home of former Victorian Football Association club, Yarraville. In 2002 the league, in particular its 2nd Division, found itself a national audience when a Seven Network reality TV show, The Club, followed the performance of a team called the Kensington Hill Hammerheads throughout the season. The players, coach and president were chosen on the show, and after finishing third in the regular season, went on to win the flag. For the first time in the league's history, the WRFL First Division Grand Final was played at Chirnside Park in Werribee. In previous years, only the Second Division Grand Final was played there. This was partly caused by the renovations being done at the Whitten Oval. 1931  Parkside 1932  Riverside 1933  Parkside 1934  West Footscray 1934  West Footscray 1936  Parkside 1937  Parkside 1938  Spotswood 1939  ICI (Deer Park) 1940  ICI (Deer Park) 1941  ICI (Deer Park) 1942  Braybrook 1943  Kingsville 1944  Braybrook 1945  Braybrook 1946  Braybrook 1947  West Footscray 1948  Parkside 1949  Parkside 1950  Seddon 1951  Parkside 1952  Braybrook 1953  Seddon 1954  Braybrook 1955  Braybrook 1956  Braybrook 1957  Parkside 1958  Spotswood 1959  F&Y Socials 1960  F&Y Socials 1961  F&Y Socials 1962  Parkside 1963  F&Y Socials 1964  Kingsville 1965  Albion 1966  St Albans 1967  Parkside 1968  Spotswood 1969  St Albans 1970  West Footscray 1971  Spotswood 1972  Spotswood 1973  Braybrook 1974  Braybrook 1975  Braybrook 1976  Seddon 1977  Spotswood 1978  North Footscray 1979  Braybrook 1980  North Footscray 1981  Parkside 1982  West Footscray 1983  North Footscray 1984  Spotswood 1985  Albion 1986  Albion 1987  Spotswood 1988  St Albans 1989  St Albans 1990  Spotswood 1991  Seddon 1992  Seddon 1993  Spotswood 1994  Deer Park 1995  Spotswood 1996  Parkside 1997  Yarraville 1998  Port Melbourne Colts 1999  Port Melbourne Colts 2000  Parkside 2001  St Albans 2002  Hoppers Crossing 2003  Parkside 2004  Hoppers Crossing 2005  Port Melbourne Colts 2006  Port Melbourne Colts 2007  Spotswood 2008  Spotswood 2009  Spotswood 2010  Albion 2011  Spotswood Division 2 Premiers 1988  Coburg Districts 1989  Ascot Vale 1990  Port Melbourne Colts 1991  Altona City 1992  Hoppers Crossing 1993  Braybrook 1994  Albion 1995  West Newport 1996  North Melbourne & Kensington 1997  St Albans 1998  Seddon/Yarraville Club 1999  Braybrook 2000  Yarraville 2001  Seddon/Yarraville Club 2002  Kensington Hill Hammerheads 2003  North Sunshine 2004  Altona 2005  Altona 2006  Glenorden 2007  West Footscray 2008  Sunshine Heights 2009  Deer Park 2010  North Footscray 2011  Deer Park
