The Northeast Minneapolis Arts Association (or NEMAA) is an organization of artists and allies in Northeast Minneapolis. Its primary focus is the large visual arts community in Northeast although it does support and help promote the arts in Northeast in general. The organization was formed as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in 1998 to provide year-round support to the Northeast arts community that presents the Art-A-Whirl event once yearly. NEMAA's most visible event is still Art-A-Whirl, held annually on the third weekend in May since 1996. During the event hundreds of artists open their workspaces to the public, and other performing, visual and educational groups have special art events all around the neighborhoods of Northeast. NEMAA also sponsors the Fall Fine Arts Show in November as a way of promoting NEMAA members in the holiday season, and First Thursdays, a monthly year-round open-studio night. Membership categories are individual artist, professional gallery, non-profit/arts organization, community friend and local business partner. NEMAA was instrumental in establishing the Northeast Minneapolis Arts District in 2003, the first such officially designated district in the city. The district is bounded by the Mississippi River on the west, Broadway on the south, Central Avenue on the east, and 27th Avenue on the north.
