The National First XV Championship is the Premier Rugby Union competition for Secondary Schools/Colleges in New Zealand. Winning the National First XV Championship is widely recognised as the highest sporting honour at Secondary School level. Students who excel in this area tend to go on to higher honours (professional and national representation). The majority of students who excel usually come from 'traditional rugby schools or colleges'. However some students have been known to come out of schools with little rugby success or reputation. The National First XV Championship is ultimately broken down via the Top 4. The Top 4 is made up of the 4 main franchises/regions: Blues, Chiefs, Hurricanes and South Island. Prior to the Top 4 competition, schools first must compete in their local/provincial competitions. Once provincial Champions are determined they then enter into their regional/franchise playoff. This determines the regional/franchise Champion that will represent that region/franchise at Top 4. Each region/franchise is made up of the following: Blues: (Winners of each province enter into a 3 way playoff) Northland Champion, North Harbour Champion and Auckland Champion Chiefs: (Winners of each province enter into a 3 way playoff) Counties Champion, Bay of Plenty Champion and Waikato Champion Hurricanes: (Champions play off in a knock out format till one team is determined) Poverty Bay Champion, Hawkes Bay Champion, Manawatu Champion, Taranaki Champion and Wellington Champion South Island: This region is arranged slightly different as it is a merger of the Press Cup (Crusaders) Competition and the Highlanders Competition: - Press Cup (Crusaders): Nelson Bays, Marlborough, West Coast and Canterbury - Highlanders: North Otago, Otago and Southland The winners of the Press Cup - (Crusaders) and the Highlanders competitions play in a one off final to determine the South Island Champion. The winners of the Blues, Chiefs, Hurricanes and the South Island franchises make up The Top Four. These 4 teams then have 2 semis finals with the winners advancing to the National 1st XV Final. Until 2011 the Top 4 format has been the Blues Champion vs the Hurricanes Champion in one Semi Final while the other Semi Final was the Chiefs Champion vs the South Island Champion (consistent with the regional competition where the Blues Secondary Schools side plays the Hurricanes Secondary Schools side in one round robin fixture, while the Chiefs Secondary Schools side plays the South Island Secondary Schools side in the other) As of 2012 the format for both the Top 4 and the Regional Representative Tournament will be Blues Champion/Region vs Chiefs Champion/Region and Hurricanes Champion/Region vs South Island Champion/Region. As listed below, some titles have been shared. There have been calls for overtime to be included to determine an outright winner. Overtime is applied at Semi Finals but not the Final. [1] During the regular season the majority of schools also compete in traditional fixtures or rivalries. Some of these traditional fixtures (more commonly known as 'Traditionals') date back to the mid to late 19th Century. Listed below are some notable traditional fixtures (in no particular order): The oldest and most prestigious nationwide trophy in 1st XV rugby dates back to the end of World War One. At the end of the Great War in Ismailla Egypt, ten divisions of troops, Six British, three Australian and a New Zealand division were waiting to be sent home. Authorities within these divisions decided competitive sport would be a good way to fill in the time. A committee of officers was formed and they visited Cairo in search of a suitable trophy for a rugby tournament. When they returned they had a magnificent but somewhat cumbersome trophy made of Sterling Silver and stamped with made in London in 1904. The trophy was entitled the Moascar Cup. Moascar was thought to be the name of a village in Egypt it is in fact the Arabic word for camp. It was decided that the trophy in honor of the occasion should be mounted on the centre part of a sawn off German propeller shot down near the camp sight. The Cup, also contested by a South African division, was won by the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade who won eight and drew one of its nine games. On return to New Zealand considerable debate was had on what was the best use for the trophy. It was agreed that it should be returned to the New Zealand Rugby Union and used for an appropriate competition. The individual charged with convincing the New Zealand Rugby Union of the trophys merit was Lieutenant-Colonel E J Hublert, commanding officer of the Mounted Rifle Brigade. The trophy was accepted and the New Zealand Rugby Union decided the best use for the Trophy was to use it to promote Secondary Schools rugby which had suffered badly because of the War. A knockout competition in both the Islands was inaugurated with the final to be played at Athletic Park in Wellington. However the best intentions of administrators were undone by apathetic attitudes by some schools and three years of expensive and time-consuming matches. Soon the knockout competition was abolished and replaced by a challenge system. The current rules state that holders must nominate matches which other schools can compete for it. A total of 7 matches must be announced once the cup is won. There used to be a tendency where holders would withhold putting the cup up of grabs against stronger opposition while making it available against perceived lesser sides. Doing so reduced the risk of losing the cup. There have been calls for the cup to be put up more regularly such is the demand and prestige of it. Many have voiced that the cup be put up at all home games and all knock out fixtures. Another call to change has been on a tied score at full time. Like the National Top 4, no overtime is applied. The Moascar Cup defender continues to hold the cup if scores are tied at full time. There is an overwhelming want to include overtime to determine an outright winner. [2] [3] There are two other major tournaments that are contested. Neither hold effect on qualification to the National Top 4. However the Moascar Cup may be put up for contention. Formed in 1997, the New Zealand Super Eight group of schools incorporates the 8 boys' high schools from their respective provincial cities of the central North Island. The first sporting competitions were sponsored by Canterbury International and commenced in 1998, involving rugby and cricket. Since that time, the Super Eight concept has grown to include not only 10 sports competitions, but also a cultural festival and professional development programmes for management staff and curriculum teachers. For rugby, many argue that the Super 8 is on par with the Auckland 1A competition where both are the toughest pre-Top 4 round robin competitions in New Zealand secondary school rugby. The Super 8 is contested between, Gisborne Boys High School, Hamilton Boys High School, Rotorua Boys High School, Tauranga Boys High School, Napier Boys High School, Hastings Boys High School, New Plymouth Boys High School and Palmerston North Boys High School. [4] The Quadrangular Tournament is the oldest secondary school rugby tournament which is competed between Wanganui Collegiate, Wellington College, Nelson College and Christ's College. It was initially known as the Triangular Tournament from 1890 to 1924 till Nelson College joined in 1925. In 2012 the 85th Quadrangular Tournament will be contested. Regardless of being oldest tournament in New Zealand secondary school rugby, it does not receive the same recognition as the National Top 4, Auckland 1A or Super 8 as no school that competes in it has ever gone on to win a National Championship.
