Frazier Thompson III, better known by his stage name Trae Tha Truth (formerly Trae), is an American rapper from Houston, Texas. He is a part of the underground rap collective Screwed Up Click. Trae and Z-Ro, along with Dougie D,[1] are the founding members of the group Guerilla Maab.[2] He is the older brother of Houston rapper Jay'Ton. Trae Tha Truth first gained exposure on the Houston rap scene in 1998, when he made his rapping debut with a guest appearance on Z-Ro's album Look What You Did to Me.[3] In 2003, he began his solo career with the album Losing Composure. 2004's Same Thing Different Day, 2006's Restless, and 2007's Life Goes On followed shortly after. Trae Tha Truth has also worked relentlessly with fellow Houston rapper Chamillionaire on his various Mixtape Messiah series. Trae Tha Truth was involved in a scuffle with fellow Texas rapper Mike Jones at the 2008 Ozone Awards. Both later apologized for the incident.[4] It was recently suspected that Trae Tha Truth's music was banned from Houston's local radio Station, 97.9 The Boxx.[5] In 2008, Trae Tha Truth was awarded by the mayor of Houston, Bill White, and Council Member Peter Brown with his own day, Trae Day, in honor of his outstanding work within the community. This is the first time the honor has been extended to a rap artist. Trae Day was celebrated July 22, 2008. Trae Tha Truth hosted the second annual Trae Day in July 2009 near Texas Southern University when it was marred by gun violence at the end of the event. When he explained to the morning crew at radio station KBXX "97.9 The Box" that he did not condone the shooting, he was accused by one of the personalities of being responsible for the violence per se the lyrical content. When Trae Tha Truth retaliated against her on a mixtape, KBXX banned Trae Tha Truth's music and contributed music from the station and ordered their personalities not to play his music. It caused backlash in the music community as several DJs at KBXX were terminated from their positions since due to playing songs that featured Trae.[6] Due to his inability and hindrance from being able to promote his music in Houston as a result, Trae has filed a lawsuit with KBXX early in 2010 citing damages to his career.
