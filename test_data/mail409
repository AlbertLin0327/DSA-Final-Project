Edwin Davis French (18511906) was a highly esteemed bookplate engraver, producing at least 330 beginning in 1893. Born in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, his artistic career had begun in 1869 with silver engraving for the Whiting Manufacturing Company. Later, he became a founding member and trustee of the American Fine Arts Society. Two men who influenced French's work were Albrecht Drer and Charles W. Sherborn. Many of his patrons belonged to the Grolier Club. He was interested in constructed languages and was active in the Volapk movement [1], and also learned Esperanto. French had suffered from poor health most of his life, having left Brown University in his sophomore year because of it, and eventually succumbed to tuberculosis.
