Form 8850 is a United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax form entitled "Pre-Screening Notice and Certification Request for the Work Opportunity Credit". The form is used in implementation of the federal government's Work Opportunity Tax Credit program, which provides federal tax credits as incentives for employers of low-income youth participating in summer work programs, former welfare recipients, food stamp recipients, people referred from vocational rehabilitation programs, military veterans, ex-felons, and people receiving Supplemental Security Income.[1] Although it is an IRS form, Form 8850 is filed with the state workforce or employee security agency to request certification that a newly hired employee is a member of an eligible group.[1][2] Employers are required to complete the form to be eligible for City of Chicago tax incentives to employ the city's "Welfare to Work" participants.[citation needed]
