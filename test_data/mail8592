Bardet-Biedl syndrome 5 protein is a protein that in humans is encoded by the BBS5 gene.[1][2][3] This gene encodes a protein that has been directly linked to Bardet-Biedl syndrome. The primary features of this syndrome include retinal dystrophy, obesity, polydactyly, renal abnormalities and learning disabilities. Experimentation in non-human eukaryotes suggests that this gene is expressed in ciliated cells and that it is required for the formation of cilia. Alternate transcriptional splice variants have been observed but have not been fully characterized.[3]  BBsome: BBS1 BBS2 BBS4 BBS5 BBS7 TTC8 BBS9 chaperone: MKKS BBS10 BBS12 connecting cilia: LCA5 RP1 RPGR RPGRIP1 TULP1 outer dynein arms: DNAH5 DNAI2 DNAL1 cytoplasm: KTU nucleus: GLIS2 intraflagellar transport: IFT80
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
