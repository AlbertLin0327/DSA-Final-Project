"All I See" is a song performed by Australian recording artist and songwriter Kylie Minogue from her tenth studio album X (2007). The song was written by Jonas Jeberg, Mich Hedin Hansen, Edwin "Lil' Eddie" Serrano and produced by Jeberg and Cutfather. It was released digitally as a lead single in North America on 11 March 2008, so Minogue could boost her career in the urban market in the U.S.[1] The song was released to American radio formats on 15 April 2008. A version featuring rapper Mims was released to radio formats and included as a bonus track on the American edition of X. Musically, the song is a strong Contemporary R&B song, with soft Pop sounds and Hip-Hop music. The song contains an interpolation taken from "Outstanding", written by Raymond Calhoun and performed by The Gap Band.[2] "All I See" received mixed reivews from most music critics, who complimented the lyrics, while some didn't enjoy the cross-over of Minogue going to R&B. Initially, the song didn't receive much success in North America, only to peak on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart in the U.S., failing to peak on the Hot 100. It did chart in Canada though. The song was performed only on her KylieX2008 tour at some shows only. To promote the single and the album in the United States, Minogue appeared on several television programmes. On 31 March 2008, she appeared on the Today show for an interview with Matt Lauer.[3] On 1 April, Minogue performed "All I See" live on Dancing with the Stars.[4] On 7 April 2008, Minogue appeared and performed "All I See" on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.[5] The single was particularly released in the US and in Canada to boost Minogue's image in the States, as it appeared she had a low profile, but the song only managed to peak at number 3 in the US dance charts. "All I See" received generally mixed reviews from most music critics. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave it an extended review. He said: Kylie Minogue has churned out three singles from her album X since its international release last year, but it's another song, "All I See," that will be the record's official first single in the U.S. It's one of only three tracks that don't seem to fit the otherwise consistent Euro-disco mash-up of the singer's 10th studio album (the belated Ray of Light rip-off "No More Rain" and the Fergie/Gwen-meets-the-Pussycat-Dolls-meets-"SexyBack" monstrosity that is "Nu-Di-Ty" are the other offenders), but that's exactly why it's a perfect fit for this country. In his review of X, Slant critic Dave Hughes compared "All I See" to Janet Jackson's 1997 house hit "Together Again," and while the breathy vocals are totally Janet, the rest of the song is a virtual carbon copy of Ne-Yo's "Because of You," right down to the measured 4/4 beat and harpsichord. If radio programmers could find room on their playlists for Natasha Bedingfield's market-pandering "Love Like This," then surely they can find space for "All I See." Although a remix featuring MIMS will be serviced to radio stations soon, there's still no video in sight, so if the song fails, Kylie's American fans can blame her record label, which hasn't figured out how to market the superstar in the U.S. since "Can't Get You Out of My Head." The promotional music video for "All I See" was directed by William Baker, Minogue's creative director. It was filmed in three hours while Minogue was on break from KylieX2008 tour rehearsals.[6] Filmed in black-and-white using an Alcatel One Touch Easy, it features Minogue in various outfits and dancer Marco da Silva dancing in front of a white background. The video premiered on Minogue's website on 18 April 2008.[6] Kylie performed the song on the following concert tour: These are the formats and track listings of major single releases of "All I See".
