Black Bear Sports Network is the radio and television name for University of Maine sports. The radio affiliates broadcast football, men's and women's basketball, men's ice hockey and select baseball and softball games. The current network formed in the summer of 2007 when Learfield Sports took over the marketing for the Maine Black Bears. Previous to this the radio network was known as The Sports Zone Black Bear Network and was heard on Bangor, Maine ESPN Radio affiliate WZON, at times including WLOB and WEGP. WABI-TV, Bangor's CBS affiliate has been the long-time television home for Black Bear sports, including most home football games and men's and women's basketball games (also carried on Portland CW affiliate WPXT). Select basketball games are carried on ESPN Plus and America East TV and picked up by NESN or carried locally on other Bangor-based television stations such as WVII and WFVX. All affiliates carry The Tim Whitehead Show, football and ice hockey. WLOB and WJJB do not carry men's and women's basketball. WJJB only carries The Tim Whitehead Show Initial press release on movement of radio affiliates UM Network adds WLOB 2010 Black Bear radio guide Italic text Notable people Orono Collins Center for the Arts Fay Hyland Botanical Plantation Fogler Library Hudson Museum Maynard F.
