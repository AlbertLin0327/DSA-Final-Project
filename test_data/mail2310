USS Kajeruna (SP-389) was a patrol vessel that served in the United States Navy from 1917 to 1919. Kajeruna was built as the private steel-hulled steam yacht Hauoli in 1902[3] or 1903[4] by John N. Robinton & Son at Erie Basin, New York, for Frank M. Smith of Shelter Island, New York. She later was renamed Seminole, then Kajeruna. In May 1917, the U.S. Navy acquired Kajeruna from her owner, A. W. Gieske of Baltimore, Maryland, for use as a patrol vessel during World War I. She was commissioned that month as USS Kajeruna (SP-389) with Lieutenant J. R. Hudgins, USNRF, in command. Assigned to the 5th Naval District and based at Norfolk, Virginia, Kajeruna served as flagship of Patrol Squadron 3. She operated in Hampton Roads and the Chesapeake Bay for the remainder of World War I. Kajeruna left active service soon after the war ended on 11 November 1918. The Navy returned her to her owner on 16 January 1919.
