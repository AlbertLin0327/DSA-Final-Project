The 200506 season was Fussball Club Basel 1893's 113th in existence and the club's 12th consecutive season in the top flight of Swiss football. FC Basel started the season of with various warm-up matches. These included teams from the Swiss lower league as well as teams from France, Croatia and the Ukraine. The FC Basel aims for the 200506 season were to retain the league title, win the cup and as well as to qualify for the UEFA Champions League group stage. As Swiss champions, Basel entered the UEFA Champions League third qualifying round against German Bundesliga club Werder Bremen. Basel's biggest signings of the 200506 season were defenders Daniel Majstorovi and Kji Nakata who were brought in to replace Patrick Mller, who was set to sign for Olympique Lyonnais, and the retiring Murat Yakn. Forward Eduardo was signed on contract following his successful loan spell but Argentinian goalscorers Christian Gimnez and Julio Hernn Rossi left the club. Basel's priority aim for the season was to win the league championship for the third time in a row. Despite the 3-0 defeat by FC Thun in the second round, Basel started well into the season and led the championship right until the last day of the league campaign. On 26 February 2006, FC Basel broke their own club record of 52 unbeaten league games in the St. Jakob Park. The new record is 59. But the strand ended on the final day of the season with a last-minute goal by Iulian Filipescu of FC Zrich, knocking Basel out of contention and thus giving Zrich their first national championship since 198081. Basel missed their championship aim. A 60th straight home league match undefeated would have made Basel champions for third time in a row. The final score was 1-2 in favour of Zrich. The last minute loss of the Championship and the subsequent riots, the so called Basel Hooligan Incident, meant that the club had to carry consequences. As well as a huge fine, the first two home games of the 200607 Swiss Super League season were held completely without fans, as so called "ghost matches". The following three matches were held with just a part of the stadium capacity, without the fans from the "Muttenzer Kurve" (the eastern fan block). Basel's clear aim for the Swiss Cup was to win it. In the early rounds of the 200506 Swiss Cup Basel were draw with away games against lower league teams. However, they were defeated in the third round in the away tie against FC Zrich. Basel missed their aim. Because Basel entered the Champions League in the third qualifying round their aim was to reach the group stage. However they were drawn against Werder Bremen and lost 4-2 on aggregate and they subsequently dropped into the UEFA Cup where they met NK iroki Brijeg of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the First Round. Basel sealed a 60 aggregate win. The clubs aim was therefore modified to remaining in the competition over the winter break. They and were drawn into Group E alongside RC Strasbourg, A.S. Roma, Red Star Belgrade and Troms I.L.. With somewhat luck they qualified for the Round of 32. Here they defeated AS Monaco and in the next round beat RC Strasbourg to qualify for the Quarter-Finals. They were drawn against Middlesbrough and won the first leg at home 2-0 and travelled to the Riverside Stadium. Here despite an early lead, Middlesbrough fought back to win the match 41 and the tie 43. But the aim for this campaign was achieved and very successfully and Matas Emilio Delgado ended the 200506 UEFA Cup season as the contests top goal scorer.
