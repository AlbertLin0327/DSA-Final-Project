Subject: Patterns of self-organization in ants 
To: Brianna
Content:
Ants are simple animals and their behavioural repertory is limited to somewhere between ten and forty elementary behaviours. This is an attempt to explain the different patterns of self-organization in ants.[1] This is an instant transition of the whole system to a new stable pattern when a threshold is reached. Bifurcation is also known as multi-stability in which many stable states are possible.[2] Examples of pattern types: Oscillating patterns of activity in which individuals at different activity levels stimulate one another emerging from mutual activation.[2] Examples of pattern types: Traveling waves of chemical concentration or mechanical deformation.[2] Examples of pattern types: Self-organized criticality is an abrupt disturbance in a system resulting from a build up of events without external stimuli.[2] Examples of pattern types:
