Babjee Moulai Sayedi Fakhruddin Shaheed is the 11th century holy Dawoodi Bohra saint who is buried in Galiakot, India. Moulai Fakhruddin, son of Tarmal (minister of Rajput king Siddhraja Jaya Singha, Anhalwara,Patan,1094-1133 AD) was sent to western Rajasthan, India for proselytizing. He died a martyr somewhere between Sagwara and Galiakot village by aboriginal highwaymen (bhil) while returning from Muharram lectures on the martyrdom of Imam Husain and was later buried in Galiakot. Annual 'Urs' (death anniversary) is held on the 27th day of Muharram, the first month of Hijri Calendar. His grave is visited by pilgrims from all over the world, however nowadays it is common to find non-Muslim locals of Galiakot to come and pray at Fakhruddin Shaheed's Mausoleum. The tomb complex Fakhri Mazar' is also known as 'Taherabad' includes mosques, gardens, and international class accommodation facilities for visitors.
