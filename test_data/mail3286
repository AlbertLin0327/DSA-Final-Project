Ducati Desmosedici is the name of the series of four-stroke V4 Prototype Motorcycles developed by Ducati to compete in the MotoGP World Championship. GPx indicates the version of the bike, where x corresponds to the year the bike raced (i.e. the Desmosedici GP9 raced in 2009). Ducati abandoned the Grand Prix racing scene at the start of the 1970s. For many years the 500 class was essentially a class for two-stroke motorcycles, an engineering technology that was far removed from the four-stroke road-going machines sold by Ducati. Technical rules changed in 2002, giving priority to four-stroke machinery and turning the 500 class of World Road Racing into the MotoGP Championship. This convinced Ducati to make a much-awaited return to the track in the new MotoGP class. Ducati history is classically based on L-twin engines, using desmodromic valve technology. Initially, Ducati considered the possibility of creating a MotoGP super-twin, taking advantage of the MotoGP regulations that give twin-cylinder machines a considerable weight reduction over four, five or six-cylinder bikes. However, analysis indicated that a twin-cylinder engine would not have been able to produce the required amount of power, more than 230hp (170kW), without excessively increasing the number of revs. A twin would have had to rev at over 17000rpm, but this would require a very short stroke and a very large bore, as a result producing possible combustion problems. The basis of the design of the Desmosedici engine therefore is two classical Ducati L-Twins next to each other, making a Double L Twin with two-cylinder Stroking at the same time (also called Twin Pulse). With four valves per cylinder, the total number of valves is sixteen - Desmosedici means desmodromic distribution with sixteen valves shortened in Italian Design had started in 2001, the bike was unveiled at the 2002 Italian GP at Mugello, for use in the following seasons MotoGP World Championship. Vittoriano Guareschi, the Ducati Corse test-rider, followed every phase of the Desmosedicis development process from early testing to track debut and the projects evolution. In 2007, Ducati's pilot Casey Stoner, riding a Desmosedici, obtained Ducati's first MotoGP World Championship Title. While still fully committed to Superbike racing, the Ducati Marlboro Team of Loris Capirossi and Troy Bayliss would compete in all rounds of the 2003 MotoGP championship. The Desmosedici GP3 quickly scored a series of results with Loris Capirossi, who stepped onto the podium in the opening round of the championship in Japan and won the GP Catalunya in Barcelona. Riders Capirossi finished fourth in the final championship standings and Bayliss sixth; while Ducati finished second overall in the Manufacturers standings In 2004 the Desmosedici GP4, again in the hands of Capirossi and Bayliss, underwent a series of major modifications. A large part of the season went by before the bike became competitive, but the season concluded with both riders on the podium. At 989cc, the GP4's top speed record of 347.4km/h (215.9mph) was set by Loris Capirossi at IRTA Tests in Catalunya, Spain. The GP5 version lined up for Ducatis third season in MotoGP, with Bayliss replaced by the Spanish rider Carlos Checa. Thanks to a collaboration agreement with Bridgestone, Ducati could finally contribute to the development of new tyres and by the end of the season the Desmosedici became a competitive machine. Bridgestone found that hard tyres suited the bike more than softer tyres to create grip - simply put, allowing it to spin the rear wheel gave better control. Capirossi took two wins in the Grand Prix of Japan at Motegi and in the Malaysian GP at Sepang, while Checa scored a brace of podium finishes Launched at the Italian skiing resort of Madonna di Campiglio, the GP6 is a lighter and more powerful version of the GP5. Involving better aerodynamics and a better fuel tank position, most importantly, although more powerful, the engine delivery was smoothed to make the bike more ridable. This made the bike slower on top speed, but quicker into, around and out of corners.[1] The new rider with Capirossi was Spanish rider Sete Gibernau. After encouraging winter tests, the Desmosedici GP6 took its first win of 2006 in the opening GP at Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, followed by a podium in Qatar. Capirossi led the championship for a short while, but at the start of the Grand prix de Catalunya at Barcelona, Gibernau's bike collided with Capirossi's after Gibernau braked too late and compressed his brake lever further after impacting it on the back of Capirossi's bike. Both riders ended up injured and in the hospital, with Gibernau sustaining a broken collar bone, and both missed the Dutch Grand Prix at Assen. Capirossi returned at the British Grand Prix, while Gibernau was replaced by German Alex Hofmann for the Dutch Grand Prix, the British Grand Prix, and also the Czech Grand Prix after undergoing additional surgery. With Gibernau sidelined for the final round of the season at Valencia following a collision with Casey Stoner, Ducati recalled Bayliss, who was recently crowned World Superbike champion. The race was won by Bayliss, his first MotoGP victory, with Capirossi taking second place for the first Ducati 1-2 finish. For 2007, MotoGP rules were changed to cap motors to a maximum displacement of 800cc. In response, Ducati built the GP7. Its specifications were: 800cc bike, double L-Twin motor (4 Cylinder Twin Pulse), approximately 168kW (225hp) at 19000rpm and a greater than 330km/h top speed (Confirmed 337.2km/h (209.6mph)).[citation needed] Ducati started its project to build an 800cc MotoGP bike extremely early and according to Ducati's racing chief Filippo Preziosi, by August 2006 Ducati had already built twenty 800cc engines with various specifications.[2] In addition, an early version of the bike was track tested for the first time during early May 2006.[3] Public testing with the bike began at the Brno Track, where Loris Capirossi had won the day before riding the GP6, on the 21st of August. Capirossi's lap times on the prototype GP7 were only 1.4 seconds off his track record time set on the 990cc GP6. Further testing of the GP7 in Motegi, Japan, revealed that the 800cc machine could run faster laps than the higher-displacement 990cc bikes, and held nearly a second advantage over the next fastest 800cc bike, a Honda ridden by Dani Pedrosa. MotoGP's 800cc era officially began with the first race of the 2007 MotoGP season, at the Losail International Circuit in Qatar. Casey Stoner won the race on the new GP7. The bike had a clear top speed advantage over the rest of the grid, due to its higher output motor. A new track record was set on the GP7. Second place contender and five time former World champion, Yamaha's Valentino Rossi, complained that "unfortunately, there was too much difference between (our) bikes in the straight" and "Our Yamaha will never go as quick on a straight as the Ducati." These words turned out to be true, as the GP7 enjoyed a top speed advantage throughout the season, although the other manufacturers (Yamaha, Honda, Kawasaki and Suzuki) closed the gap significantly by the end of the year. Stoner and his Bridgestone-shod Ducati proved to be the top combination in MotoGP and he won the world championship at Motegi, Japan, on September 23, 2007, four races before the end of the season. An evolutionary update of the GP7 design,[4] Ducati's entry for the 2008 MotoGP World Championship was tested first in February 2007.[3] For purposes of avoiding chatter which was encountered on some occasions with GP7, the rigidity of the GP8's frame was altered, although further details of relevant modifications are not disclosed.[4][5] In addition, in an attempt to reduce an effect described as "pumping", some modifications to the bike's suspension geometry were made.[4][5] As with its predecessor the GP8 contains a four-cylinder 800cc engine with desmodromic actuation of its 16 valves. The engine has improved mid-range response and top-end power compared to that of the GP7. During 2007 Ducati tested a special fuel saving clutch arrangement which disengaged the clutch during braking and reduced fuel consumption, however the arrangement was not incorporated in the GP8 as various advanced lubricants and fuels used with the GP8 are believed to provide comparable fuel savings, while decreasing internal engine friction and increasing maximum power.[6] In race trim the bike recorded an official top speed of 343.2km/h (213.3mph) at the 2008 Chinese motorcycle Grand Prix.[7] However, in a video of the same race, Casey Stoner is seen to ride the bike at the speed of 347km/h (216mph). The GP9 was Ducati's entry for the 2009 MotoGP World Championship. Ducati began testing it on track prior to May 2008.[8] On 9 June 2008, Ducati publicly rolled out the Desmosedici GP9 for testing at Circuit de Catalunya.[9] A distinctive feature of GP9 is its carbon fibre chassis, representing a departure from Ducati's traditional steel trellis chassis.[10] Although carbon fibre chassis were tried in mid 1980s, currently no other MotoGP racing team uses them.[10] The GP9 reached a speed of 348km/h in the fifth round of the MotoGP championship at Mugello. On January 15, 2010, Ducati introduced the GP10 for the 2010 MotoGP season.[11] Development concentrated on improving engine longevity, to keep within new engine restrictions, and rideability.[12] Most notably, the GP10 makes use of a big-bang firing order for the first time since the Desmosedici changed from the 990cc to the 800cc engine capacity.[12] It also features redesigned fairing, first seen at the 2009 Estoril round.[12] On January 12, 2011, Ducati introduced the GP11 for the 2011 MotoGP season.[13] The bike will be raced with Valentino Rossi and Nicky Hayden. On March 19, 2012, Ducati finally unveiled the anticipated GP12 for the 2012 MotoGP season which incorporates the new displacement standards as a 1,000 cc machine. The bike will again be raced by Valentino Rossi and Nicky Hayden. The Desmosedici RR is a road-legal version of the Desmosedici, first delivered in early 2008.
