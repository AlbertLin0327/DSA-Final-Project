Winston County is a county of the U.S. state of Alabama, formerly known as Hancock County before 1858.[1] Its name is in honor of John A. Winston, the 15th Governor of Alabama. As of 2010, the population was 24,484. Its county seat is Double Springs. Winston County was established under the name Hancock County on February 12, 1850, from territory formerly in Walker County.[1] It was originally named for John Hancock, Governor of Massachusetts and famous signer of the American Declaration of Independence, with its county seat at Houston. On January 22, 1858, the county was renamed Winston County to honor Alabama Gov. John A. Winston. During the American Civil War, Winston County gained attention for its opposition to secession, a sentiment so strong that the county is sometimes referred to as the Republic of Winston. The county today plays on its reputation as the "Free State of Winston" to attract tourists. The county's opposition to the Confederacy is briefly mentioned in the novels To Kill a Mockingbird and Addie Pray. Tap Roots, a 1948 movie based on a novel, presents a highly fictionalized and inaccurate version of Winston County's Civil War history. In 1883 the county seat was moved to Double Springs to be near the center of the county, since Cullman County was created from the eastern portion of Winston.[2] The civil rights judge Frank M. Johnson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit was born in the Delmar Community in Winston County. Winston County was traditionally Republican even before the modern rebirth of the GOP in Alabama during the latter 20th century. In 1966, for instance, it was the only county in the state to vote against both Democratic gubernatorial nominee Lurleen Burns Wallace and U.S. Senator John Sparkman, instead supporting Republicans James D. Martin of Gadsden and John Grenier of Birmingham.[3] According to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of 631.86 square miles (1,636.5km2), of which 614.44 square miles (1,591.4km2) (or 97.24%) is land and 17.42 square miles (45.1km2) (or 2.76%) is water.[4] As of the census[8] of 2000, there were 24,843 people, 10,107 households, and 7,287 families residing in the county. The population density was 40 people per square mile (16/km2). There were 12,502 housing units at an average density of 20 per squaremile (8/km2). The racial makeup of the county was 97.32% White, 0.038% Black or African American, 0.46% Native American, 0.13% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 0.90% from other races, and 0.81% from two or more races. Nearly 1.5% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. There were 10,107 households, out of which 31.80% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 59.6% were married couples living together, 9.10% had a female householder with no husband present, and 27.9% were non-families. Nearly 25.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.43, and the average family size was 2.89. In the county, the population was spread out with 23.7% under the age of 18, 7.90% from 18 to 24, 28.7% from 25 to 44, 25.5% from 45 to 64, and 14.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 96 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.5 males. The median income for a household in the county was $28,435, and the median income for a family was $32,628. Males had a median income of $26,206 versus $17,760 for females. The per capita income for the county was $15,738. 17.1% of the population and 12.9% of families were below the poverty line. 21.8% of those under the age of 18 and 23% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line. In keeping with its history from the American Civil War, Winston County was for many years an island of Republican Party voting in an otherwise heavily Democratic Party state.[9] In 1912 Winston County joined three other Alabama counties in voting for the Bull Moose Party candidacy of Theodore Roosevelt.[10] This populated place also has portions in an adjacent county or counties Coordinates: 340857N 872229W / 34.14917N 87.37472W / 34.14917; -87.37472
