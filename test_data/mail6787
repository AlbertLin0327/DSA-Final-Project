The Sandra Feinstein-Gamm Theatre (aka The Gamm) is a non-profit theater in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. It is housed in the Pawtucket Armory Center for the Arts along with the J.M. Walsh School for the Performing and Visual Arts. The theatre was founded in 1984 as Alias Stage by seven members of the graduating class of Trinity Rep Conservatory. In 1998, the theatre staged its last performance as the Alias Stage - a staging of King Lear - before being renamed as the Sandra Feinstein-Gamm Theatre due to receiving a donation of about $100,000 from Alan Shawn Feinstein in memory of his sister.[1][2] The theater was close to shutting in 2001 when it had to move from a church on Mathewson Street in Providence.[3] The theater was in the Providence, Rhode Island Jewelry District in cramped accommodation until 2003, when it moved to a new 124-seat stage in an old police garage, part of the Pawtucket Armory Center.[4] 200809 Season 200708 Season 200607 Season 200506 Season 200405 Season 200304 Season
