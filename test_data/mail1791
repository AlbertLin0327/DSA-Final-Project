Dee Does Broadway is the second album from Dee Snider, frontman of Twisted Sister, after 12 years without any release. It was produced by Dee, grammy winning Patti LuPone and Bebe Neuwirth. Guests in the album include the Grammy and Emmy award winning Cyndi Lauper, Clay Aiken, Nick Adams and many others.[1] The original idea started back in 2009 with an exchange of phone messages between Alice Cooper and Dee Snider. Over the past several years both Alice and Dee had done work with guitarist/producer Bob Kulick on his various tribute albums (Dee even did a vocal on an Alice Cooper tribute record) and had both been impressed with the quality of his work. In the fall of 2010, Dee was starring in the hit Broadway musical Rock of Ages. Suddenly the idea of doing an album of rocked out show tunes himself makes sense and a deal is struck with the only label Dee's manager, Phil Carson was sure could handle a record this unique, Razor & Tie. Their support and success with Twisted Sister's, A Twisted Christmas CD gave Dee condence in their ability to make an abstract project like this happen.[2]
