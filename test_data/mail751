Ataehir is a modern suburban district of Istanbul, Turkey.[2] It is located at the junction of the O-2 and O-4 motorways in the Anatolian part of Istanbul. The housing development is designed to include 18,000 skyscraper condominiums offering luxury residences for 80,000 people with higher incomes. Ataehir, hosting headquarters and offices of notable companies, is also a business and trading centre. Facilities such as tennis courts, gyms and cinemas make it a popular sports and leisure place. Ataehir was awarded the Habitat prize. As of 2006, 8596 housing units were present within the site, housing approximately 35,000 people. Completed projects in the area are the Kentplus Ataehir, Agaoglu MyWorld, UpHill and Ataehir Residence blocks. Unlike in Baheehir, another satellite city in Istanbul, no single-family house types are designed for the site. Most buildings are high rise blocks, and some around the main public square can be considered skyscrapers. Another difference between the two developments is that Ataehir lacks recreational areas on the same scale as Baheehir. The plan grows around a linear axis around the main boulevard, Ataehir Bulvar. The subdivision includes nurseries, primary schools, five high school (see List of high schools in Turkey), cinemas, two shopping malls (Palladium, Optimum) supermarkets, banks, two office, many real estate agencies and various services and shops. Ataehir municipality collects the garbage. Heating is supplied using natural gas. Anadolu Medical Center and Acibadem have outpatient clinics here. Ataehir offers 55m studio apartments,two-bedroom apartments varying from 67 to 110m, three-bedroom apartments varying from 90 to 135m, and four-bedroom apartments varying from 134 to 150m. The subdivision was designed with sufficient car parks. Even though most families have more than one car, the parking area within site provides enough space. Various types of car parks above ground have been used, while the underground car parks are mainly one storey only. The area is very favourable for transportation by private car, while choices of public transport are very limited. Though, they are becoming more. For private car owners the subdivision is: 5minutes from the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge, 3minutes from Highway D-100 and the Izmir-Ankara Trans-European Motorway (TEM), 5minutes from the CarrefourSA Shopping Centre erenky and Metro shopping centres, 6minutes from Optimum Shopping Centre, 5minutes from Marriott Hotel 10minutes from Badat Avenue, the upper-class high street of Kadiky district, and 15minutes from Sabiha Gken Airport, the second international airport of Istanbul.
