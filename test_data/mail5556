Wenlock and Mandeville are the official mascots for the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics being held in London, United Kingdom.[1] The mascots were unveiled on 19 May 2010;[2] this marks the second time (after Vancouver's Miga, Quatchi, Sumi and Mukmuk) that both Olympic and Paralympic mascots were unveiled at the same time. The mascots were created and designed by iris, a London-based creative agency.[1][3] Wenlock and Mandeville are animations depicting two drops of steel from a steelworks in Bolton.[2] They are named after the Shropshire town of Much Wenlock, which held a forerunner of the current Olympic Games, and Stoke Mandeville Hospital, a facility in Buckinghamshire that initially organised the Stoke Mandeville Games, the precursor of the Paralympic Games.[2] London Assembly Baroness Dee Doocey raised the issue of the London Organising Committee charging for appearances of the characters; she was formerly the chair of the committee that oversees the London Olympics. Doocey suggested only the richest of schools would be able to afford the appearances. Appearances are 850 for the two mascots to appear at a community event or multi-school sports day, rising to 1,720 for events requiring an overnight stay, and 2,450 for a trip to Scotland or Ireland. The fee covers the performer, cohort, van hire, and accident liability insurance. LOCOG insist they only charge the appearance cost, nothing more. LOCOG does issue some free appearances to schools demonstrating a commitment to the games, but Doocey says that poorer schools are too busy with students to deal with the paperwork.[4] The two are the worlds first customisable mascots.[clarification needed] According to the associated (fictional) storyline, they were formed from the last girder of the Olympic Stadium. Their skins are made of highly polished steel allowing them to reflect the personalities and appearances of the people they meet. They have cameras for eyes filming all of their adventures and London taxi headlights with the first letter of their name W for Wenlock and M for Mandeville. Wenlocks name is inspired by Much Wenlock in Shropshire, England, where the Wenlock Olympian Society held its first Olympian Games in 1850, regarded as an inspiration for the modern Olympic games. He has five friendship bracelets on his wrist. Each bracelet takes the colour of an Olympic ring. The three points on his head represent the three places on the podium. The pattern on his body with the logo of the games symbolises the whole world coming to London in 2012. The shape on the front of his head represents the shape of the Olympic stadium roof. In the run-up to the games Wenlock hopes to make as many friends as possible and always looks on the bright side of life. Mandevilles name comes from Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England which held The Stoke Mandeville Games, the inspiration for the Paralympics. Mandeville wears a pink stopwatch on his wrist which on models reads 0:20:12. His helmet-like head with three points coloured blue, red and green represents the agitos, the Paralympic Symbol. They appeared in The Beano in issue 3601, and the strip, drawn by Nigel Parkinson and written by Ryan C. Gavan, will continue until the Olympics begins, in August 2012. [5] The British childrens writer Michael Morpurgo wrote the story concept to go with Wenlock and Mandeville and an animation titled Out of a Rainbow was produced by the London office of Beijing based Crystal CG;[6][7][8] it is intended that this will form part of an ongoing series concerning the mascots in the run-up to the games.[2] "Adventures on a Rainbow", a sequel to "Out of a Rainbow", was released on 1st March 2011. This episode to their story was publicised on the mascot's Twitter and Facebook pages as well as their website. The video featured guest appearances from Olympic athletes: Phillips Idowu, Shanaze Reade and Tom Daley as well as Paralympic athletes: Ellie Simmonds and Mandip Sehmi.[9][10] At the steelworks in Bolton they are finishing building the last girder for the Olympic stadium. Two drops fall out of the molten-steel, and once cooled are picked up by a man named George. The day happens to be Georges retirement day so he signs the finished girder and cycles home. He gets home to his wife and grandchildren as they give him his retirement cake. Later when everyone else is asleep he decides to make a gift for his grandchildren out of the steel drops. The next day George and his wife give their grandchildren the steel Wenlock and Mandeville. The two children take the mascots up to the attic and place them on the windowsill when a rainbow forms going through the house. The rainbow brings Wenlock and Mandeville to colour and to life where they learn sports from the children, posters and the TV. Wenlock and Mandeville realise their names from books and trophies before leaving on the rainbow. As they do, the kids high-five, knowing they have done well in giving life to the newest Olympic Mascots. The story ends with: And then suddenly the rainbow is back. Wenlock and Mandeville know that its time to go: their journey has just begun: so many adventures to have, so many people to tell. But they will meet again; in London, in 2012. Theyll be there, Youll be there, the whole world will be there. The story starts in Bolton when the last steel girder of the Olympic Stadium is being transported to London. The two children from the original story make their way up to their attic, and look out of the window to see a rainbow that has formed by their house, on which Mandeville is travelling. Mandeville sends a text message to one of the children's phones. Mandeville then arrives at Stoke Mandeville stadium and meets members of the Great Britain national wheelchair rugby team. He watches a match while sitting on Mandip Sehmi's lap. Mandeville then joins Ellie Simmonds in one of her swimming training sessions. Afterwards the creator of Wenlock and Mandeville, George, and his family are seen on a bike ride where they meet Shanaze Reade. The family then try some BMX riding themselves. Meanwhile, the lorry carrying the last steel girder of the Olympic Stadium is travelling along a road near Much Wenlock. Wenlock, who is visiting his spiritual hometown, watches the Wenlock Olympian Games and Phillips Idowu in the triple jump. Wenlock then takes part in the 110m Hurdles; he successfully jumps the first hurdle, but a fellow competitor trips over their hurdle, and Wenlock gives up his race time to help the athlete. Wenlock then travels on the rainbow to a community pool where George and his family are swimming. Tom Daley is preparing for a dive on the platform and Wenlock joins him, so everyone in the pool witnesses their successful dive. The video ends with: "Wenlock and Mandeville are on their magical adventure. The twins will be looking out for them whenever they see a rainbow, and you can do the same! You'll see them again, we all will; the whole world will see them in London, in 2012." In response to their launch the UKs leading design publication Creative Review had this to say "Both are clearly of the digital age. And we have to say, we think they look rather good...".[11] In other quarters their design has been greeted with some disdain. One columnist theorised that the pair were the product of a "drunken one-night stand between a Teletubby and a Dalek".[12] Others have compared the mascots to Izzy, the mascot of the 1996 Summer Olympics, another critically panned mascot.[13] However it has been reported that children of the target audience (5 to 15 years) find the duo enjoyable.[14]
