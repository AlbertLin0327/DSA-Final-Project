Khan had his screen debut in the 2010 film West Is West, the sequel to the 1999 film East Is East. He was fifteen years old when he auditioned,[4] and was sixteen years old and sixth form at Thornton School when he shot his role as Sajid Khan in the film.[5] Khan had done only one school play when younger and had no other acting experience when cast.[2][6] He was considered "something of a find" for the film due to his resemblance to actor Jordan Routledge who played the role of Sajid in the original film.[7] Of his performance, Belfast Telegraph wrote that Khan "has revealed he already had a strong connection to the character of Sajid Khan before he was cast in the sequel to hit comedy East Is East,"[1] RTE wrote "Newcomer Aqib Khan is superb as the cheeky, angst-ridden teen, and his change of heart plays out convincingly",[8] The Scotsman wrote "as Sajid, young Aqib Khan has enough natural charm and confidence to make him an endearing scene-stealer."[9] and National Post wote "newbie Aqib Khan fits perfectly."[10] This was followed by his television debut in the ITV drama series The Jury II in the role of Rashid Jarwar, an 18 year old who has a mild form of Asperger's syndrome.[4][11] He was born in Bradford, England and is of Pakistani decent. He has a younger sister Aroosh Khan (born 20 September 2008) and two other sisters. Khan was born in 1994 to Pathan Muslim parents and his ancestors were from Attock, Pakistan.
