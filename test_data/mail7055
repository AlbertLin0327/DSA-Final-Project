Occupy Comics: Art & Stories Inspired by Occupy Wall Street is a currently-in-production, deluxe comic book anthology funded on Kickstarter and seeking to articulate themes of the Occupy Wall Street movement through comics as well as to fund-raise on behalf of the protesters.[1][2] As Bleeding Cool described it: Wired explained the perceived relationship between Occupy Wall Street and art: The project was officially announced by organizational spearhead Matt Pizzolo in Wired Magazine on October 13, 2011, several weeks after the occupation of Zuccotti Park began on September 17, 2011.[4] According to Wired: Occupy Comics launched on Kickstarter November 9, 2011 with a minimum funding goal of $10,000 USD and a roster of 30 professional artists and writers, including Charlie Adlard, Marc Andreyko, Kevin Colden, Molly Crabapple, J.M. DeMatteis, Joshua Dysart, Brea Grant, Joe Keatinge, George Krstic, Joseph Michael Linsner, B. Clay Moore, Steve Niles, Laurie Penny, Matt Pizzolo, Steve Rolston, Riley Rossmo, Douglas Rushkoff, Tim Seeley, Simon Spurrier, and Ben Templesmith.[3] Shortly after the Kickstarter campaign launched, Wired released a follow-up article which explained the project's funding goals and strategy: Thats the goal of the Occupy Comics Kickstarter project... The plan is to graphically document the Occupy movement with the help of a roster of respected comics creators and artists, then funnel the proceeds directly to the protesters taking hits and making history for the 99 percent. Comics is at the root of this thing, Halo-8 founder and Occupy Comics organizer Matt Pizzolo said in an e-mail to Wired.com. Just look at Alan Moore and David Lloyds V for Vendetta masks at every protest. A Guy Fawkes mask is now a more iconic image of street protest than a gas mask. Occupy Comics contributor Molly Crabapple ... lives a block from Zuccotti Park, where the Occupy Wall Street movement got its start. She said she visits the site, where hundreds of people have encamped to protest economic inequality, almost daily. Its a beautiful community, almost a mini-city, complete with library, kitchen, free store, coffee, compost and Ben and Jerrys ice cream scooped out by Ben himself, Crabapple told Wired.com in an e-mail. But the media wasnt portraying this. So I started drawing the protesters to show the diversity down at Zuccotti. Later, I did more blatantly political work in response to attacks on unions and police brutality in Oakland. Early in the campaign, the project got an unexpected boost when Frank Miller attacked Occupy Wall Street in a controversial and polarizing blog post.[5] As the campaign closed in on its funding goal, 13 additional contributors were added to the roster, including Vito Delsante, Dan Goldman, Amanda Palmer, Darick Robertson, Mark Sable, and Salgood Sam.[6] The campaign passed its funding goal and was guaranteed its budget on November 20, 2011, 11 days in on its 30 day funding period.[7] Shortly after passing its funding goal, six additional contributors were added to the roster, including Mike Allred, Shannon Wheeler, Eric Drooker, Ryan Ottley, Dean Haspiel, Guy Denning, and David Lloyd.[8] In the final week of its Kickstarter campaign, Alan Moore joined the roster.[9] Although not an official reunion, the participation of Alan Moore and David Lloyd was considered significant to many observers of the Occupy movement, as the duo's V For Vendetta originated the Guy Fawkes mask that has become emblematic of the movement. Moore and Lloyd have not worked together since V For Vendetta was completed in 1989.[10][11][12][13] Alan Moore further boosted Occupy Comics' profile when, during an interview with Honest Publishing, he responded to Frank Miller's attack on the Occupy movement. The conflict led to mainstream news coverage of Occupy Comics in The Huffington Post, Deadline Hollywood, MTV, Entertainment Weekly.[14][15][16][17] On December 9, 2011, the Occupy Comics Kickstarter campaign ended with $28,640 raised from 715 backers, earning 286% of its funding goal.[18] On March 20, 2012, it was announced that Occupy Comics would not be released through an existing comic book publisher, instead a new company called Black Mask Studios would be formed to release the project.[19] According to Comic Book Resources: Wired reported that Steve Niles (30 Days of Night) and Brett Gurewitz (guitarist-songwriter Bad Religion, owner Epitaph Records) joined with Pizzolo to found Black Mask: Its become this monopolized walled garden where youre only allowed to grow two things: superheroes and movie treatments, Pizzolo told Wired via e-mail. Were going to open new space outside the entrenched market where we can cultivate more subversive experimental and literary comics to reach broader audiences. Inspired by the controversial but influential 1960s anarchists Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers and Edgar Allen Poes class-conscious gothic short The Masque of the Red Death, Black Mask Studios was teased Sunday during WonderCons spotlight panel on Niles, who serves as creative director. Pizzolo runs the biz as president, and Gurewitzs Epitaph Records empowers the indie operation. Comics and punk have a lot in common, being transgressive art forms with under-appreciated potential for social influence, Gurewitz said in an e-mail to Wired. Leveraging Matts brilliant Occupy Comics model with Black Mask Studios might be disruptive, in a really good way, for both artists and fans. On June 12, 2012, Black Mask Studios opened its webstore and officially released Occupy Comics #1 with the announcement that Pulitzer Prize-winner Art Spiegelman, Bill Ayers, Ryan Alexander-Tanner, Jimmy Palmiotti, and Matt Bors had joined the Occupy Comics roster.[22] Spiegelman told Wired: Occupy is one of the most significant things happening that could actually bring hope and change to our ravaged nation.[22]
