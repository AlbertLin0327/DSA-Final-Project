The son of Thakur Roop Singh of Karanpura, he was born in 1895 in Thikana Karanpura located in Churu District, Rajasthan, India. Thakur Roop Singh who moved to Karanpura was son of Thakur Duley Singh of Thikana Lohsana. Thakur Dal Singh was the youngest son of Thakur Roop Singh, the others being Rugh Singh, Mukan Singh, and Ganpat Singh. Thakur Dal Singh passed Rajputana Middle School Examination in April 1915.[1] After high school, he studied at the Allahabad Agricultural Institute, Allahabad, U.P. from 1917 to 1919.[2] At the Institute for three years he studied surveying, agronomy, horticulture, animal husbandry, and botany. Thakur Dal Singh was appointed Tehsildar in the then Bikaner State and he served at various places such as Churu and Sardar Shahr.[3] At that time the post of Tehsildar was almost equivalent to the post of Collector today. He also passed the Legal Practitioner Examination certified by the Chief Justice of Bikaner State.[4] During his service he was recognized as an eminent administrator, receiving many First Class Sanads (certificates) from His Highness Maharaja of Bikaner for his outstanding service.[5][6] As a philanthropist, Thakur Dal Singh had constructed many kunds (underground water storage tanks charged from rainwater), wells, schools, and temples through charity not only in his native Thikana of Karanpura but many other villages in Churu District. He was considered a pioneer in the development of many villages in Churu District during the state time.[7] When Thakur Dal Singh died in 1945, H.H.
