Jesuit High School is a private Catholic high school in Beaverton, Oregon, United States. It was founded by the Society of Jesus in 1956, and uses the Jesuit curriculum. Located in the Oregon Province of the Society of Jesus, it is a college-preparatory school and accepts students of all faiths. It is a coeducational school with approximately 1,300 students. The school was the 43rd Jesuit high school to be established. Though it was not finally established until 1956, the process of founding a Jesuit high school in Portland began in 1907, when property was purchased by the parish of St. Ignatius and set aside for a future high school. A lay appeal to the Jesuit Provincial for a high school in 1929 came to nothing. In 1954 the Holy Cross Fathers of Portland announced the closing of Columbia Prep., and a plan for the Jesuits to take over the premises was discussed, but again dropped. Finally in 1955, the Jesuit Father Provincial was asked by the Archbishop to set up a school. Hillsdale Dairy Farm, a 55-acre (220,000 m2) plot to the west, some 15 minutes drive from downtown Portland, was chosen. The property changed hands for $165,000. Jesuit priests and Holy Cross priests raised pledges of $117,000 by Wednesday of the first week of a fund raising campaign in churches, and hundreds of thousands of dollars were raised by door-to-door canvassing. Jesuit High School opened its doors to its first class of freshmen on September 10, 1956. The school opened its doors to women in 1993.[5] Jesuit High School has been accredited through Northwest Association of Accredited Schools since 1961.[3] In 1989 and 1998, Jesuit High School was honored in the Blue Ribbon Schools Program, the highest honor a school can receive in the United States.[6] In 1998, The Alex L. Parks Performing Arts Center opened, providing visual art, music, and drama resources. In 2004, the Educational Theatre Association cited the drama program as "extraordinarily professional," and featured a JHS production on the Friday and Saturday night performance slots of its week-long international festival.[citation needed] The entire Choral department received the Academic All-State award for having the highest average grade point average in 2006.[7] On June 20, 2007, Sports Illustrated rated Jesuit the number one high school athletic program in the nation, citing success both on and off the field.[8] In the 2005-2006 academic year, Jesuit won seven state championships in various sports and activities. Jesuit High School has won the Oregon 4A All Sports Award 13 years in a row, and has received the Oregonian Cup five times.[9] Jesuit High School has claimed a state championship in each of its sports over the course of 53 years, including football, men's soccer, men's cross-country, women's tennis, men's tennis, women's swimming, women's soccer, women's ski racing, women's cross-country, women's golf, men's basketball, volleyball, men's track & field, softball, and men's swimming. In November 2009, ESPN ranked Jesuit's Women's Soccer Team number one among all women's programs nationwide.[citation needed]
