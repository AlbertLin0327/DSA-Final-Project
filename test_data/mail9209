The design of Latvian euro coins feature three separate designs.[1] The design of the national side was publicized in July 2006 on the home page of the National Bank of Latvia. The designs featured were the Latvian maiden, (which featured on the 5 lats coin prior to World War II) on the 1 and 2 euro coins, the greater Coat of arms of Latvia on the 10, 20 and 50 cent coins, and the lesser Coat of arms of Latvia on the 1, 2 and 5 cent coins. Originally, the it was planned that Freedom Monument would be featured on the 2 coin, but as the original design did not meet the regulations of the European Central Bank (it reached out into the ring of the coin and changed one of the stars), it had to be changed; Latvia decided that a changed design of the Monument would not be as recognisable and decided to use the Latvian maiden on the 2 coin, as well.[2] Latvia has been a member of the European Union since 1 May 2004 and is a member of the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union, but it has not completed the third stage of the EMU and therefore still uses its own currency, the Latvian lats. Latvia had originally planned to adopt the euro as its official currency on 1 January 2008. It is now expected that Latvia will introduce the euro in 2014.[3] In February 2012, Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg urged Latvia not to delay its goal of joining the euro-zone in 2014.[4] For images of the common side and a detailed description of the coins, see euro coins. These "coins" must be regarded as pattern pieces: they have no official status or sanction. The Maastricht Treaty originally required that all members of the European Union join the euro once certain economic criteria are met. Latvia meets 3 out of the 5 criteria. 1 No more than 1.5% higher than the 3 best-performing EU member states. HICP rate as published by the ECB. 2 No more than 2% higher than the 3 best-performing EU member states.
