The Richardson River is a waterway that flows into Richardson Bay, Coronation Gulf in the northern Canadian territory of Nunavut. Its mouth is situated northwest of Kugluktuk, Nunavut. The Rae River is 1.3km (0.81mi) away.[1] The Richardson River is named in honor of Sir John Richardson, a Scottish naval surgeon, naturalist and arctic explorer of the region.[2]
