The Second Battle of Mesilla was an unusual engagement of the American Civil War, it was fought on July 1, 1862 and was the last engagement between Union and Confederate forces in Arizona Territory. A bloodless skirmish outside of Confederate Arizona's capital of Mesilla between Arizona militia and local pro Union New Mexican guerrillas resisting the Confederate foraging expedition, resulted in a United States victory. Combat ended with no known casualties on either side, but the Confederate force lost several horses and their equipment. The arrival of the advance party of the California Column on the west bank of the Rio Grande River on July 4, 1862, prompted the rebel Army to begin withdrawal to Franklin and then San Antonio three days later covered by Herbert's Battalion of Arizona Cavalry acting as rearguard.
