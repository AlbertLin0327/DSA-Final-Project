Walid ibn Utbah (died 624) was the son of Utba ibn Rabi'ah and brother of Hind bint Utbah of the Quraysh tribe in the region of Mecca, Saudi Arabia. He was a fierce Meccan warrior who was killed by Ali (Ali ibn Abi Taleb) in the traditional 3 champions' combat duel on the day of the Battle of Badr before the full battle began. Walid, his father and uncle were the three champions of the Meccan army in duel against Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib, Ali, and Abu Ubaidah ibn al Jarrah. In the combat duel, Walid's father was killed by Hamza. And after his uncle first wounded Ubaidah with his dagger after his sword was hit away by Ubaidah, Ubaidah had killed him.
