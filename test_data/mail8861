In Zulu culture, "isibongo" is a clan name or "praise name". The term is derived from the verb "-bonga" meaning "to praise", "to thank", "to worship" or "to call by a clan name". The plural form "izibongo" (praises) refers to praise poetry, a typical Zulu art form where the fame of a person is extolled.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
