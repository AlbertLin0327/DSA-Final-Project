Myrsine mezii is a species of tree in the myrsine family. It is endemic to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is threatened by habitat loss. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States. There are two remaining populations of this tree for a total of just five individuals. One of the populations is made up of a single tree which is in poor condition.[1]
