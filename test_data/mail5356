Wirek (German: Antonienhtte) is a district of the southern Polish city of Ruda lska. Originally, it was a part of a village called Nowa Wie, but separated in 1828. Wirek has been an industrial center since early nineteenth century; its first factory - Antonienhtte ironworks, was opened in 1805. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the settlement grew. A school was opened in 1856; a Roman Catholic church in 1874; and a year later, a rail connection with Chebzie was constructed. In 1921, Wirek became part of Polish Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship. During World War II, it was occupied by Germany. In 1951, Wirek became part of Nowy Bytom and then became part of Ruda lska, when it was created in 1959.
