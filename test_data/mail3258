Sentier is a station on Paris Mtro Line 3 in the 2nd arrondissement. It opened on 20 November 1904 as part of the first section of the line between Pre Lachaise and Villiers, which opened a month earlier. The station is named after a path (French: "sentier") leading to the city's fortifications, now called the Rue du Sentier. The station is one of the few to have its entrance incorporated into the front of a building. A secondary entrance is located 87 rue Raumur, it contains railings designed by Hector Guimard and is listed as a "monument historique".[1] Coordinates: 485203N 22047E / 48.867569N 2.346387E / 48.867569; 2.346387
