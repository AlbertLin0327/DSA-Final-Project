Also known as the porcupinefish[1] or porcupine puffer. The spot-fin porcupinefish is circumtropical[2]: Diodon hystrix may be up to 91cm long and weigh as much as 2.8kg. It is coloured tan with dark spots above and pale below, and has many long, moveable spines. It is largely nocturnal. Sea urchins, gastropods and hermit crabs. Juveniles are pelagic up to the time that they are about 20cm in length. Adults favour lagoons and seaward reefs, sheltering under ledges or in caves during the day. Although classified as benthic, they may sometimes be found hovering high in the water.[1] Diodon hystrix are poisonous to eat, possibly due to the accumulation of tetrodotoxin. Has been documented to achieve a life-span of 10 years and attain a length of 69 cm in a public aquarium.
