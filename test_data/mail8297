Fearmaster is a fictional character in the Marvel Universe. Fearmaster is a high-ranking officer in the Alchemax Corporation in the year 2099. He is also the head of the Cyber-Nostra. He was first seen issuing orders to Benneli and the Multi-Fractor.[1] He next changed Delphine's leg to solid bone for attempting to escape him.[2] He sent the Cyber-Nostra to clear citizens out of the Barrio.[3] Later, he sent Multi-Fractor to kill that era's Punisher.[4] However, he was then informed that the Multi-Fractor had been killed, and sent the Ninja-Nostra to kill the Punisher.[5] He finally battled the Punisher himself.[6] The Fearmaster's right hand was allegedly altered using nano-technology (molecular engineering), giving him the ability to alter elemental compositions by touch with his right hand, e.g. turning human flesh to gold, silver, calcium, etc. His right hand is grossly misshapen with four digits, including two opposable thumbs. He wears a special glove on his right hand made of unknown materials immune to his superhuman power. Fearmaster is a master planner and organizer, and a talented strategist and tactician. He is mentally unbalanced.
