Inculto (stylised "InCulto") is a Lithuanian music group. It has the following members: Colombian-born Lithuanian Jurgis Didiulis (lead vocal), Aurelijus Morlencas, Sergej Makidon, Jievaras Jasinskis and Laurynas Lap. In their first Eurovision attempt, the band came second after LT United in the Lithuanian national final of 2006 with their song Welcome To Lithuania. On 4 March 2010, Inculto won the Lithuanian national final to represent Lithuania in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010. They performed Eastern European Funk in the second semi-final held on 27 May 2010 in Oslo, Norway.[1] The band did not receive enough points to get into the final. However they did receive top points (12) from one country, Ireland. The band announced that they will be splitting up by the end of January 2011. They did so in a Facebook article. They also decided to finish up by releasing their last album for free which can be downloaded on http://www.labas.lt/inculto. [2] In the article they say that they are very happy with 2010 and would like to stop at a high point for the band.
