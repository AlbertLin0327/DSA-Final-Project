Fray Servando Teresa de Mier (in full, Jos Servando Teresa de Mier Noriega y Guerra) (October 18, 1765, Monterrey, Nuevo Len, New Spain  December 3, 1827, Mexico City) was a Roman Catholic priest and a preacher and politician in New Spain. At the age of 16 he entered the Dominican Order in Mexico City. He studied philosophy and theology in the College of Porta Coeli, and was ordained a priest. By the age of 27 he had earned his doctorate and was a noted preacher. On December 12, 1794, day of the Virgin of Guadalupe apparition, in the presence of Viceroy Miguel de la Gra Talamanca y Branciforte, marqus de Branciforte, Archbishop Manuel Omaa y Sotomayor and the members of the Audiencia of New Spain, Mier preached a sermon affirming that the apparitions of the Virgin of Guadalupe had been 263 years before. In the beginning nobody said anything about the sermon but one week later, the Archbishop Nuez de Haro, condemn him to the excomunion, prison and exile in Spain for 10 years. For his "disrespect", Archbishop Nuez de Haro condemned Mier to ten years exile in the convent of Las Caldas del Besaya, in Cantabria, Spain; a perpetual ban from teaching, preaching or hearing confessions; and the loss of his doctoral degree. In 1796, he was granted permission to present his case to the Council of the Indies. However, on his return from the Council, he took the wrong road and was arrested again. This time he was confined to the Franciscan convent in Burgos. In 1801, he escaped and took refuge in Bayonne, France. From Bayonne he passed to Bordeaux and later to Paris. There he was interpreter for the rich Peruvian Jos Sarea, Count of Gijn. Together with Simn Rodrguez, Simn Bolvar's former teacher, he opened an academy in Paris to teach Spanish and to translate the Atala of Franois-Ren de Chateaubriand. (The Atala was set in Louisiana, with an Indian heroine.) Mier also wrote a dissertation against Constantin-Franois de Chasseboeuf, comte de Volney. In Paris, he came to know Lucas Alamn, then traveling as a student but later an important conservative politician in Mexico, Baron Alexander von Humboldt, the Duke of Montmorency, and Chateaubriand. In 1802, he left the Dominican Order and became a secular priest in Rome. When he returned to Madrid, he was again apprehended, this time for a satire he had written supporting Mexican independence. He was sent to the reformatory in Seville, from which he escaped in 1804. However, he was again arrested and returned to prison, where he spent three years. Then the pope named him his domestic prelate, because he had converted two rabbis to Catholicism. In the war between France and Spain, he returned to Spain as military chaplin of the Volunteers of Valencia. He was present at many battles. In Belchite he was taken prisoner by the French, but he was able to escape again (for the fifth time). He presented himself to General Blake, who recommended him to the Junta of Seville for his services. The Regency in Cdiz granted him an annual pension of 3,000 pesos. He moved to London, where he collaborated with Jos Mara Blanco on El Espaol, a newspaper that supported the independence movements in Latin America. In London, he met the Spanish revolutionary Francisco Javier Mina. Mina convinced him to join an expedition to New Spain to fight for its independence. They sailed for New Spain on May 15, 1816. With the capture of the insurgents' fort at Soto la Marina on June 13, 1817, Mier was taken prisoner again, this time by the royalists. He was sent to the castle of San Carlos de Perote, thence to the dungeons of the Inquisition, and finally, in 1820, to Havana. Escaping for a sixth time, he fled to Philadelphia, where he remained until the establishment of Mexican independence. In February 1822, he returned to Mexico, at Veracruz, but was again taken prisoner and held at the castle of San Juan de Ula, still in control of the Spanish. The first Mexican constituent congress was able to secure his release; he became a deputy for Nuevo Len. He opposed the Mexican Empire under Agustn de Iturbide, and was arrested again. He was imprisoned in the convent of Santo Domingo, but on January 1, 1823 he escaped again, for the seventh and last time. He was elected a deputy to the second constituent congress. On December 13, 1823 he delivered his famous speech "Discurso de las profecias" (loosely translated, "Prophetic Discourse"). In this speech he argued for a centralized republic or in the event of a federal system being adopted, for its being in moderation. He was among the signers of the Act Constituting the Federation and of the Federal Constitution of the United States of Mexico. Mexico's first president, Guadalupe Victoria, invited him to live in the palace. Nearing death, he invited his friends to a party to bid him farewell on November 16, 1827. He gave a speech justifying his life and opinions, and died on December 3, 1827. He was interred with great honor in the church of Santo Domingo. In 1861 his body was exhumed, together with 12 others. All the bodies were mummified. The mummies were exhibited under the claim they were victims of the Inquisition. Some of the mummies, including Mier's, were sold to an Italian who accepted the claim. His mummy was later shown in Brussels [1] but what became of his remains after that is unknown. His name is inscribed in letters of gold on the Wall of Honor of the Legislative Palace of San Lzaro, the building that today houses the Chamber of Deputies in Mexico City. Mier published many speeches, sermons and letters on religion and politics, including the following:
