Phil Economidis is a Rugby League coach currently coaching the Souths Logan Magpies club in the Queensland Cup. He is perhaps best remembered for his stint as coach of the now defunct Gold Coast Chargers in the old Australian Rugby League. Phil guided the Chargers to finals glory in 1997, they beat the Illawarra Steelers 25-14 in front of just 8,197 dedicated fans at Parramatta Stadium, believed to be the lowest ever finals series attendance for the ARL/NRL. Phil also assisted in "Coach Talk", inside the sixth edition of Shamrock's Rugby League book.[1] Throughout his ARL career with the Chargers, he guided the club to 20 glorious victories from 69 starts, a percentage of 29%, the highest of any Gold Coast coach pre Gold Coast Titans. Phil's moustache was a favourite of many league fans in the late 90's.
