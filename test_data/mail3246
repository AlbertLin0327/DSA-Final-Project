This Darkened Heart is the second studio album by the metalcore band All That Remains, released on March 23, 2004. It includes the singles "This Darkened Heart", "Tattered on My Sleeve" and "The Deepest Gray", all three of which had music videos created for them. Unlike their first album Behind Silence and Solitude, this album uses clean vocals and more metalcore influences. Production, mixing and engineering were by the Killswitch Engage guitarist, Adam Dutkiewicz.
