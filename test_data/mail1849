Lucy Boynton (born January 17, 1994) is an English actress. She attended Blackheath High School, and now attends James Allen's Girls' School. She is the daughter of Graham Boynton, the Group Travel Editor of the Telegraph Media Group and Adriaane Pielou, a travel writer.[1] Her first professional role was as the young Beatrix Potter in the 2006 British-American film Miss Potter. Boynton has said that the first day of filming Miss Potter was "the best day of [her] life."[2] In 2007, Boynton was nominated for the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Feature Film  Supporting Young Actress, for Miss Potter, but did not win. She went on to play Posy Fossil in 2007, one of three main characters, in the BBC film Ballet Shoes.[3] Posy is a young, ambitious ballerina who is taken under the wing of a prestigious dance academy. Boynton did not actually dance in Ballet Shoes; a body double was used for the dancing scenes. Boynton also played the role of Margaret Dashwood in the BBC serial Sense and Sensibility. Lucy most recently filmed the role of Lucia di Narni in BORGIA for Canal+. She recently filmed a guest lead on LEWIS. She appeared in MO with Julie Walters and David Haig.
