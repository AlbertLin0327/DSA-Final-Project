Dr Brown's Cel-Ray soda is a soft drink with a celery flavor. It is fairly easy to find in New York City and in South Florida, but rather obscure elsewhere; it can sometimes be found at Jewish delicatessens and restaurants. It can also be found at certain grocers that specialize in American food in Israel, and other specialty grocers. The flavor, derived from celery seed extract, is reminiscent of ginger ale but with a pronounced celery flavor that is more pungent or peppery than ginger ale. Dr. Browns Celery Tonic was, according to the company, first produced in 1868 in Brooklyn, New York. It was served in New York delicatessans starting in 1869 and sold as a bottled soda starting in 1886.[1] The Food and Drug Administration objected to its being called a tonic, and in the 1900s the name was changed to Dr. Browns Cel-Ray (soda). Cel-Ray was so popular in the 1930s among New York City's Jewish community that it earned the nickname "Jewish Champagne". Dr. Browns briefly produced a diet Cel-Ray, but it was discontinued due to low sales. Other celery tonics"/"celery sodas were produced in the 1890s, but only Dr. Browns celery product remains today. Dr. Browns sodas are kosher and can be found in many delicatessens. [2] Cel-Ray was mentioned in Seinfeld season eight episode, The Pothole.
