Waianae High School is a public, coeducational secondary school in the Waianae CDP,[1] City and County of Honolulu, Hawaii, United States, on the leeward (western) coast of the island of Oahu. The school about 40 miles (64km) northwest of central Honolulu CDP. An average of 2,000 students are enrolled annually in grades 9-12.[2] Waianae High School is part of the Leeward School District, under the Hawaii State Department of Education. The 40-acre (160,000 m2) campus is located at 85-251 Farrington Highway between the towns of Mkaha (to the north) and Waianae (to the south). Waianae High School is situated on the coastline; the Pacific Ocean is directly west of the campus and Farrington Highway bordering on the east. This location makes it the only high school in the U.S. built on the beach.[citation needed] The school's football field, which borders the shoreline, is named after the school's first principal, Raymond Torii. The school's annual commencement ceremony is usually held there. The campus boasts the sculptures Kuikahi by Eli Marozzi and Four Valleys by Ken Shutt. Waianae High initiated its self-contained career academy program in 2004. According to the school's website, the academies provide students work-based education in addition to a core college preparatory curriculum. Each of the four career academies has several hundred students enrolled. Groups of teachers serve in teams in each academy.
