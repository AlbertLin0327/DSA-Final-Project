The 19561957 season was the 58th completed season of The Football League. The tables below are reproduced here in the exact form that they can be found at The Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation website[1] and in Rothmans Book of Football League Records 188889 to 197879,[2] with home and away statistics separated. Beginning with the season 189495, clubs finishing level on points were separated according to goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded), or more properly put, goal ratio. In case one or more teams had the same goal difference, this system favoured those teams who had scored fewer goals. The goal average system was eventually scrapped beginning with the 197677 season. Since the goal average was used for this purpose for such a long time, it is presented in the tables below even for the seasons prior to 189495, and since the goal difference is a more informative piece of information for a modern reader than the goal average, the goal difference is added in this presentation after the goal average. During the first five seasons of the league, that is, until the season 189394, re-election process concerned the clubs which finished in the bottom four of the league. From the 189495 season and until the 192021 season the re-election process was required of the clubs which finished in the bottom three of the league. From the 192223 season on it was required of the bottom two teams of both Third Division North and Third Division South.[2] P = Matches played; W = Matches won; D = Matches drawn; L = Matches lost; F = Goals for; A = Goals against; GA = Goal average; GD = Goal difference; Pts = Points Source: Ian Laschke: Rothmans Book of Football League Records 188889 to 197879.
