The ten States of Alderney Members make up the legislature (The States of Alderney) of the island of Alderney. Half of the ten States Members are elected every two years for a four year mandate. They are organised into three main committees: Policy and Finance, General Services, and Building and Development Control, each of which works under a different mandate and has a separate budget. There are also numerous smaller committees. A states meeting is held every month, and is chaired by the island's president Sir Norman Browse.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
