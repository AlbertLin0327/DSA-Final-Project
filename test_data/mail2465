The Cimmaron Range, locally Cimmarons, is a name given to a group of peaks in southwestern Colorado of the San Juan Mountains. The Cimmarons are within eastern Ouray County and are also oriented north-south. From afar the Cimmarons appear to be continuous with the Sneffels Range. The most prominent peak is Courthouse. From the Uncompahgre Valley the Cimmarons are easily observed. The most prominent and well known peak of the Cimmarons is Courthouse Mountain reaching 12,152 ft.[1]
