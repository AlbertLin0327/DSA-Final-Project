David du Bose Gaillard (18591913) was a U.S. Army engineer instrumental in the construction of the Panama Canal. Gaillard was born in Manning, South Carolina. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1884. In 1907 he was placed in charge of construction of the central portion of the Canal, crossing the continental divide. He died of a brain tumor in 1913, months before the canal's completion. The Gaillard Cut of the Panama Canal bears his name.
