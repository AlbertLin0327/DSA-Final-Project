Fallingbrook Middle School is a middle school at 5187 Fallingbrook Drive in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. FallingBrook was converted from a JK-G5 to a middle school due to the area growth with more student in the middle school age, but Jk-G5 got a brand new school which was build just down the road. Fallingbrook Middle School has been named one of the top 40 schools in Canada according to Today's Parent Magazine for its program Exploratories (or Pathways), a unique concept where students can choose their classes.[1] The school, which opened in 1996, currently has around 800 students.
