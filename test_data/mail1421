Don Lee Beebe (born December 18, 1964) is a former American football wide receiver who played for the Buffalo Bills (19891994), Carolina Panthers (1995) and the Green Bay Packers (19961997) of the NFL, and is considered one of the fastest players in NFL history. Beebe attended Kaneland High School in Maple Park, IL where he lettered in basketball, track and football. He was drafted by the Bills out of unheralded Chadron State College (after transferring from Western Illinois University) in the third round (82nd pick overall) of the 1989 NFL Draft.[1] He created a sensation at the 1989 pre-draft combine, posting times in speed and agility drills that were the marvel of the camp. Most of the coaches and staff were dumb-founded as to where he came from and how he got invited. In his 9 NFL seasons, Don Beebe caught 219 passes for 3,416 yards, rushed for 28 yards, returned 81 kickoffs for 1,735 yards, and scored 25 touchdowns (23 receiving, 1 kickoff return, 1 fumble recovery). He shares the NFL record for most appearances as a player in Super Bowls. Beebe appeared in six Super Bowls (XXV, XXVI, XXVII and XXVIII with the Buffalo Bills; XXXI and XXXII with the Green Bay Packers), and won the NFL Championship with the Packers in Super Bowl XXXI. Beebe has always been highly respected by players and coaches because of his strong work ethic and character. He was honored as an "Unsung Hero" in 1996 at the NFL Players Association Awards Banquet. Beebe is well known for making one of the most memorable plays in Super Bowl history. It occurred during the fourth quarter of Super Bowl XXVII, after Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Leon Lett recovered a Buffalo Bills fumble. As Lett advanced the ball towards the end zone he began to celebrate prematurely by holding the ball out to his right side. Although the Bills were losing 52-17 at the time, a relentless Don Beebe streaked down the field and knocked the ball out of Lett's hands just before the goal line.[2] The loose ball went through the end zone and out of bounds, causing a touchback and preventing a Dallas touchdown (which would have given them a Super Bowl-record 58 points). Beebe also caught 2 passes for 50 yards, including a 40 yard touchdown reception from Frank Reich earlier in the game. In 1998, Beebe founded House of Speed, LLC,[3] a company that specializes in training athletes in the essentials of top performance, speed and character. House of Speed began franchise operations in 2006 and has locations in eleven states. Beebe also works with several professional, collegiate and amateur sports organizations in the area of speed, including the Chicago Bears, the St. Louis Rams, the University of Illinois Fighting Illini and Club Fusion Volleyball. In 2004, Beebe began coaching varsity football for Aurora Christian School in Aurora, IL.[4] He led the Aurora Christian Eagles to the school's first State Championship appearance in 2008, where the team finished as 4A state runner-up after losing to Bloomington Central Catholic 37-28.[5] Three years later Beebe and the Eagles returned to the finals, this time winning the 2011 IHSA Class 3A State Championship after a 34-7 win over Mt. Carmel. 4 Brett Favre| 7 Kyle Wachholtz| 9 Jim McMahon| 13 Chris Jacke| 17 Craig Hentrich| 18 Doug Pederson| 21 Craig Newsome| 25 Dorsey Levens| 27 Calvin Jones| 28 Roderick Mullen| 30 William Henderson| 32 Travis Jervey| 33 Doug Evans| 34 Edgar Bennett| 36 LeRoy Butler| 37 Tyrone Williams| 39 Mike Prior| 40 Chris Hayes| 41 Eugene Robinson| 46 Michael Robinson| 51 Brian Williams| 52 Frank Winters| 54 Ron Cox| 55 Bernardo Harris| 56 Lamont Hollinquest| 59 Wayne Simmons| 62 Marco Rivera| 63 Adam Timmerman| 64 Bruce Wilkerson| 65 Lindsay Knapp| 67 Jeff Dellenbach| 68 Gary Brown| 71 Santana Dotson| 72 Earl Dotson| 73 Aaron Taylor| 77 John Michels| 80 Derrick Mayes| 81 Desmond Howard (MVP)| 82 Don Beebe| 83 Jeff Thomason| 84 Andre Rison| 85 Terry Mickens| 86 Antonio Freeman| 88 Keith Jackson| 89 Mark Chmura| 90 Darius Holland| 91 Shannon Clavelle| 92 Reggie White| 93 Gilbert Brown| 94 Bob Kuberski| 95 Keith McKenzie| 96 Sean Jones| 98 Gabe Wilkins Head Coach: Mike Holmgren Coaches: Larry Brooks| Nolan Cromwell| Gil Haskell| Johnny Holland| Sherman Lewis| Jim Lind| Tom Lovat| Marty Mornhinweg| Andy Reid| Gary Reynolds| Fritz Shurmur| Harry Sydney| Bob Valesente
