The Redknife River is a river in the Northwest Territories of Canada. It is a major tributary of the Mackenzie River. The Redknife Formation, a stratigraphical unit of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin was named for the river.[1] The Redknife river originates in the Redknife Hills, at an elevation of 765 meters (2,510ft). It flows east down the slopes of the hill, then turns north, draws water from a lake system, then turns north-east. It is crosses by the Mackenzie Highway, then turns north and flows into the Mackenzie River, at an elevation of 145 meters (476ft), 100 kilometers (62mi) downstream from Fort Providence and 75 kilometers (47mi) upstream from Jean Marie River.
