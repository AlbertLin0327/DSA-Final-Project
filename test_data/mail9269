Erwin "Pastor" Emata (born 1973 in Davao City) is a mountain climber. Based on The Himalayan Database[1] published by American Alpine Club[2], Erwin is the third[3] Filipino to reach the peak of Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world. Like Leo Oracion, the second Filipino to reach Mount Everest's summit, he is a member of the First Philippine Mount Everest Expedition (FPMEE). The Himalayan DataBase published by American Alpine Club had included Leo in the list of Everest South summitteers for 2006 on May 17[4], officially recognizing him as the 2nd Filipino on top Mount Everest. However, Mount Everest chronicler Elizabeth Hawley said on June 14, 2006 that another Filipino climber, Dale Abenojar, is the first to summit on May 15, two days before Leo Oracion.[1] The Himalayan DataBase published by American Alpine Club[2] had included Dale in the list of Everest North summitteers for Spring 2006 on May 15,[3] officially recognizing him as the 1st Filipino on top Mount Everest. On May 18, 2006, Emata reached the peak of Everest in about 24 hours after Oracion's ascent. He left Camp 4 of Everest and arrived at the summit in 7 hours and 49 minutes with the aid of oxygen. The Himalayan Database published by American Alpine Club [5] had included Erwin in the list of Everest South summitteers for 2006 on May 18, officially recognizing him as the 3rd Filipino on top Mount Everest.
