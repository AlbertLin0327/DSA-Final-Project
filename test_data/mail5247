La Sportive is a former French professional cycling team from 1918 to 1921. It won the team classification in the Tour de France three times, in 19191921.[1] Many bicycle factories that sponsored cycling teams in the early 20th century suffered and some were destroyed during World War I. There was little money to sponsor a team so several businesses ran a joint team called La Sportive.[2] to keep the sport alive. Alcyon, Armor, Automoto, Clment, La Franaise, Gladiator, Griffon, Hurtu, Labor, Liberator, Peugeot and Thomann are said to have equipped half the peloton and to have controlled the riders' salaries.[3] La Sportive won the Tour de France in 1919, 1920, and 1921 with Firmin Lambot, Philippe Thys and Lon Scieur.[4] Eugne Christophe was in a grey La Sportive jersey when, leading the 1919 Tour de France, Henri Desgrange gave him the Tour's first maillot jaune.[5]. The consortium disappeared in 1922 when the companies re-started their own teams. They included Peugeot, the Automoto and the Alycon. During the three years of the La Sportive consortium, the member companies were rebuilding their teams and it is possible these riders rode for these teams as well as La Sportive. In 1925, the old situation of cyclists riding in sponsored teams returned to the Tour de France.[6]
