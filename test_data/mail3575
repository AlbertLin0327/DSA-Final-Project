WEC 30: McCullough vs. Crunkilton was a mixed martial arts (MMA) event held by World Extreme Cagefighting (WEC). The event took place on Wednesday, September 5, 2007 at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada and aired live on the Versus Network.[1] The event featured a lightweight title match between champion "Razor" Rob McCullough and Richard Crunkilton.[1] Additionally, Chase Beebe defended his bantamweight title against Brazilian jiu-jitsu expert Rani Yahya[1], who replaced Manny Tapia on the card after Tapia suffered a knee injury. Former UFC Lightweight Champion Jens Pulver was scheduled to make his WEC & featherweight debut at this event against Cub Swanson, but was pulled from the card due to a knee injury. The matchup was rescheduled for WEC 31 three months later, where Pulver won by submission.[2] Sergio Gomez was originally slated to face WEC newcomer Donald Cerrone at this event, but was later pulled from the card and replaced by the debuting Kenneth Alexander.[3] Kevin Knabjian was expected to face Blas Avena at this event, but was later replaced by WEC newcomer Joe Benoit[4] The following is the reported payout to the fighters as reported to the Nevada State Athletic Commission. It does not include sponsor money or "locker room" bonuses often given by the WEC.
