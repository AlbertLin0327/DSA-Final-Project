Coordinates: 535150N 15534W / 53.864N 1.926W / 53.864; -1.926 Keighley West (population 15,784 - 2001 UK census) is a Ward in Bradford Metropolitan District in the county of West Yorkshire, England. This had been a major electoral target for the extreme right-wing British National Party who briefly held a seat, but thanks to a concerted effort by the local Labour Party (and a reputed failing out between the BNP councillor and her party), the BNP candidate was defeated in a 2006 by-election. The third councillor was sacked due to an incident. This was Robert Payne of the Tory party. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
