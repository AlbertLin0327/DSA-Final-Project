Newton University was a university in Baltimore, Maryland that was given a charter by the state of Maryland in 1845. It had a 77 member self-perpetuating board of regents. The first chancellor was Joseph Barlett Burleigh. After his death in 1849 he was succeeded by J. N. McJilton (1805-1875), an Episcopal clergyman. By 1852 the institution had seven professors. The university ran into legal troubles beginning in 1856 and closed in 1859.
