Edward Duyker (born 21 March 1955) is an Australian historian and author born in Melbourne, Victoria, to a father from the Netherlands and a mother from Mauritius. Despite recent immigrant roots, his mother has ancestors from Cornwall who emigrated to Adelaide, South Australia, in 1849, and he is related to the Australian landscape painter Lloyd Rees. Edward Duyker's books include several ethno-histories  Tribal Guerrillas (1987),[1] The Dutch in Australia (1987)[2] and Of the Star and the Key: Mauritius, Mauritians and Australia (1988)[3]  and numerous books dealing with early Australian exploration, among them critically acclaimed biographies of Daniel Solander, Marc-Joseph Marion Dufresne, Jacques Labillardire and Franois Pron. Much of his work seeks to redress the anglo-centrism of Australian history and he has made a major contribution to knowledge and understanding of the French voyages to the Indian Ocean and Pacific in the eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries. Duyker is a member of the editorial advisory board of Explorations published by the Institute for the Study of French-Australian Relations.[4] He is an Honorary Senior Lecturer in the School of Languages and Cultures at the University of Sydney and an Adjunct Professor of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences of the Australian Catholic University. Between 1996 and 2002 he also served as the Honorary Consul of the Republic of Mauritius in New South Wales.[5] Edward Duyker attended St Joseph's School, Malvern, Victoria in the same class as the virtuoso pianist Geoffrey Tozer with whom he maintained a fragmented but lifelong friendship. He completed his secondary studies at De La Salle College, Malvern. There, under Tim O'Hearn (later Professor and Dean of Students Australian Catholic University), he was one of the first students in Victoria to study Asian history at a secondary level (National Library of Australia Oral History collection, ORAL TRC 3101).[6] In 1970 he competed in the Seven Network's It's Academic quiz program and the following year reached the semi-final as an individual contestant in the Australian version of the quiz show Jeopardy!. As an undergraduate at La Trobe University, he studied philosophy, English literature, history and a number of inter-disciplinary subjects. One of his formative influences was the eminent Australian historian Professor Alan Frost (see 'Exploring the explorers', Agora, 2004, p.48). As a doctoral candidate at the University of Melbourne (where he also studied Bengali language), he was supervised by the Indian philosopher and literary critic Sibnarayan Ray. He received his Ph.D. in 1981 for a thesis on the participation of the tribal Santals in the Maoist Naxalite insurgency in India. Duyker was recruited by the Australian Department of Defence in Canberra in early 1981 and eventually worked in the Joint Intelligence Organization. He left in July 1983 to take up a position as a Teaching Fellow at Griffith University, Brisbane, but ultimately settled in Sydney as a full-time author in 1984. Although his early writings were focussed on South Asian subjects and in many cases were published in the Australian Defence Force Journal, Duyker soon refused to be confined as a scholar and author. Using the Dutch and French linguistic resources of his family, he edited The Discovery of Tasmania (1992)[7] which brought together all known journal extracts from the first two European expeditions to Van Diemen's Land. An Officer of the Blue (1994),[8] Duyker's critically acclaimed biography of Marc-Joseph Marion Dufresne (the first explorer after Abel Tasman to reach Van Diemen's Land), was launched by former Prime Minister of Australia Gough Whitlam. One of the book's reviewers, Professor Michael Roe, commented: 'In building his story, Duyker has to confront matters of war, politics, geography, navigation, anthropology - the list could continue. He does so with constant skill and authority. Likewise his sources range widely as to both type and location . . . ' (The Mercury, Hobart, 28 May 1994, p.38). An Officer of the Blue would also be the subject of an essay, 'The Tortoise Wins Again!', by Professor Greg Dening, published in his collection Readings/Writings (Melbourne University Press, 1998, pp.201-4).[9] Nature's Argonaut (1998),[10] Edward Duyker's biography of Daniel Solander the naturalist on HM Bark Endeavour and the first Swede to circle the globe, was shortlisted for the New South Wales Premier's History Awards in 1999. Duyker is also the co-editor, with Per Tingbrand, of Daniel Solander: Collected Correspondence 17531782 (1995),[11] which Paul Brunton described as "a major contribution to textual scholarship" (The Sydney Morning Herald, 24 June 1995, Spectrum, p.13A). With his mother Maryse Duyker he published the first English translation of the journal of the explorer Bruny d'Entrecasteaux in 2001.[12] It has become an important Western Australian and Tasmanian historical source and, with its annotations and introduction, informed public debate regarding the heritage-listing of Recherche Bay. Citizen Labillardire (2003),[13] Duyker's biography of the naturalist Jacques Labillardire, was similarly influential and won the General History Prize among the New South Wales Premier's History Awards. Professor Arthur Lucas, formerly Principal of King's College London, wrote that Citizen Labillardire was 'an exceptionally readable, richly textured work . . . The life Duyker recreates is as rich as that of the hero of any adventure novel, and the context is insightful history, not just the history of an important natural historian' (Reviews in Australian Studies, vol. 1, no. 1, 2006).[14] Although a long-term New South Wales resident, Edward Duyker is a frequent visitor to France and to Tasmania. With Australian Greens Senator Bob Brown and broadcaster Peter Cundall he was an outspoken campaigner for the protection of Recherche Bay, from logging. He has also been engaged in a number of campaigns to preserve and protect remnant bushland on the Georges River and several historic buildings in Sydney. Together with his wife Susan Duyker, a heritage architect and grazier, he is a member of the National Trust. Franois Pron: An Impetuous Life (2006),[15] Duyker's biography of the controversial zoologist of the expedition of Nicolas-Thomas Baudin to Australian waters (18001803), won the Frank Broeze Maritime History Prize in 2007. Robert Willson, described it as a story told vividly and with magnificent research . . . a splendid and absorbing biography of a gifted scientist with a fatal flaw. (Canberra Times, 19 August 2006, p.17). A recurrent theme in Edward Duyker's writing on early natural history is an attempt to recapture the sense of wonder at the unique flora and fauna encountered by early European explorers in Australia. He has also rendered homage to prescient early naturalists who offered a new focus on the natural equilibrium, the finiteness of resources in restricted locations and the precious quality of unique and vulnerable species that could easily be driven to extinction by human greed or the introduction of feral animals (see Duyker, Franois Pron, p.9). Edward Duyker has also edited A Woman on the Goldfields (1995),[16] dealing with the life of Emily Skinner on the nineteenth-century Victorian gold fields. Given the paucity of such sources on women during the Gold Rush, it was one of 100 specially selected books to be recorded by the Victorian Institute for the Blind for the Centenary of Australian Federation. Together with Coralie Younger, he authored Molly and the Rajah (1991) [17] the life of Esme Mary Fink, an Australian woman who married the Rajah of Pudukottai, India, in 1915. Described as "redolent of . . . Anna and the King of Siam" (Canberra Times, 2 November 1991), this book drew the attention of a number of film makers. Although the motion picture rights were soon reported sold and the film went into pre-production (The Good Weekend, 3 April 1993, p.43), these rights have now lapsed and the film is yet to be made. In 2007 Edward Duyker published A Dictionary of Sea Quotations[18] with a deeply personal introduction on his family's links with the sea. Indeed, Duyker often provides a strong personal orientation in his writing, whether it be references to the austerity and difficulties of his Catholic childhood (he is the eldest of eight children and his Dutch father laboured on the Melbourne waterfront for 37 years), or the experiences of his forebears in Europe and the islands of the Indian Ocean. Edward Duyker is a progressive humanist historian; he has written a great deal with the Age of Enlightenment and the French Revolution as a backdrop. Nevertheless, in his biographies of Jacques Labillardire and Franois Pron he has shown himself to be horrified by The Reign of Terror and the coercive excesses of the Revolution. He is also a bitter critic of Napoleon Bonaparte, particularly because of his suppression of democratic liberties, abrogation of his republican commitments, prosecution of global war and retention of slavey as an institution in French colonies. Ironically, both Duyker and his wife Susan are descendants of mariners who were on opposing sides at the Battle of Trafalgar ('Perspective', ABC Radio National, 21 September 2007).[19] Duyker's biographies of naturalists are largely conventional linear narratives, but they are both richly embroidered and deceptively simple. According to Professor Greg Dening, 'Edward Duyker in a simple, direct phrase can lay open the most complex issue' ('The Naturalist Mind', Australian Book Review, April 1998, pp.8-9). Duyker's books are characterised by meticulous research and great attention to detail - 'written with verve, but fortified with awesome scholarship' as Dymphna Clark put it in her review of Nature's Argonaut (Canberra Times, 16 May 1998, pp.7-8). He makes a point of visiting the places he writes about and orienting explorers' maps and journals to a modern landscape or coast. This has sometimes been under difficult circumstances, such as when he researched the naturalist Labillardire's travels in the Middle East, including war-ravaged Lebanon. In August 2005 Duyker delivered the inaugural Theo Barker Memorial Lecture at Charles Sturt University in Bathurst and took as his theme a remark attributed to R. H. Tawney that an historian needs 'a stout pair of boots'. During his lecture, he recounted how in the course of field-research in West Bengal for his book Tribal Guerrillas, he had lost 20 kilograms in weight through dysentery and malnutrition (Charles Sturt University Library, 907.2 DUYK). This was an ordeal he also recounted with witty detail in a largely autobiographical article 'The Word in the Field' (National Library of Australian News, May 1999, pp.15-17). In September 1983 Edward Duyker published an article entitled Land Use and Ecological Change in Central New South Wales (Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society, vol. 69, part 2, pp.120132). It signaled his strong interest in the use of history and ethnography to understand anthropogenic environmental change and propose solutions such as fire as a management tool. The following year he published an article entitled History and Anthropology (Man in India, vol 64, no. 1, March 1984, pp.7481) which explored a number of philosophical and methodological issues relating to these overlapping disciplines and which he demonstrated in his book Tribal Guerrillas. The late Professor Thomas Nossiter, of the London School of Economics, praised Duykers Tribal Guerrillas because it exemplifies the value of synthesising anthropology and history; and, more generally, it is a scholarly contribution to a literature on tribal rebellion and insurgency far wider than India, which embraces Greece, Vietnam and Algeria as well as sub-Saharan Africa where tribal responses to imperialism and modernisation have been significant' (Third World Quarterly, vol. 11, no. 2, April 1989, pp.226-7).[20] Similarly, Marius Damas, in his book (Approaching Naxalbari, Radical Impression, Calcutta, 1991, p.68) commented that "Duyker brings both historical and anthropological tools into play . . . Drawing on a wide range of historical and contemporary sources, including personal interviews . . . [and] provides us with a richly detailed account." In the mainstream Indian press, Kalyan Mukherjee commented that Edward Duyker generated attention in India because he was able to combine contemporary interest with history . . . in that tough ground only the very best writers survive. (Hindustan Times [Delhi], 22 November 1987). This meeting ground between history and anthropology can also be seen in An Officer of the Blue, Duyker's biography of Marc-Joseph Marion Dufresne, in which he skillfully used missionary and other accounts of Mori oral history and French journals to explain the circumstances of the explorer's death in New Zealand's Bay of Islands in 1772. Prof. Barrie Macdonald of Massey University, writing in the New Zealand Herald (Sat. 14 January 1995), described it as "a fine piece of detective work - a biography written with an empathy with its subject yet a critical eye that helps set in context a death that still has its significance in New Zealand history." What Duyker points out is that Rigorous fieldwork or direct participant observation would at first seem anathema to the analysis of the unobservable past, if the seeds of the past were not so readily represented in the present. Among non-literate peoples, oral tradition often forms the principal source for historical reconstruction of the past. The most basic means of obtaining such oral information is through fieldwork . . . While the historian has to exercise caution and discrimination, the exaggeration and distortion of past events also forms part of the thought processes and social life of people . . . When represented in structurally stable oral forms such as songs or ballads or even political slogans, the field researcher can collect data of great utility. (Duyker A Stout Pair of Boots: Recollections of an Historian in the Field, Theo Barker Memorial Lecture, August 2005, Charles Sturt University Library, 907.2 DUYK). Despite his theoretical reflections, Duyker is essentially a narrative historian who writes to tell a story. Ironically, he frequently produces equally engaging tales of research, such as his account of the detective quest involved in identifying the artist of the expedition of Bruny d'Entrecasteaux to Australia and the Pacific (see Duyker, In Search of Jean Piron, National Library of Australia News, March 2006, pp.710)[21] and his account of his search for the grave of Nicolas-Thomas Baudin in Mauritius (see In Search of Madame Kerivel and Baudins Last Resting Place, National Library of Australia News, vol. IX, no. 12, September 1999, pp.810). Many of his book reviews bear a similar mark and when he delivered the 2007 Vaughan Evans Memorial Lecture at the Australian National Maritime Museum, he chose to speak on uncovering the life of Daniel Solander (Signals, No. 81, December 2007-February 2008). Aside from his contributions to the Australian Dictionary of Biography, since 1985 Duyker has written some 70 entries for the bilingual Dictionnaire de Biographie Mauricienne/Dictionary of Mauritian Biography published on his mothers native island. Duyker has given Mauritians a sense of their place in Australian history. William Bostock called Mauritian Heritage[22] "a towering achievement among the ethnographic and genealogical studies of immigrants to Australia" ( Journal of Intercultural Studies (Melbourne), Vol. 8, No. 1, 1987). Although Eric Rolls (1923-2007) incorrectly asserted that Duyker was born in Mauritius, he noted that 'Nothing was known of any Mauritian convicts until Dr Ed Duyker . . . decided to write a book on his countrymen in Australia' (Rolls, Sojourners, 1992, p. 34).[23] James Cowan wrote that Duykers meticulously researched ethnohistory Of the Star and the Key, has given us a panorama that includes escaped convicts on the streets of Port Louis, pardoned slaves on the streets of Sydney, and a world of dreamers afflicted with 'gold fever' scurrying down shafts on the goldfields. He added: 'To discover that the Australian sugar industry owes much to those early Mauritian migrants comes as a surprise also' (Sutherland Shire Historical Society Quarterly Bulletin (Sydney), November 1990, pp.607-8). Mauritius also features strongly in all of Duykers books dealing with Dutch and French exploration of the Australian coast. Just as Edward Duyker has given Mauritians a place in Australian history, he has done the same for the Dutch in a number of pioneering monographs. These have sometimes engendered surprising, life-changing, emotional responses, as one immigrant Johan Kruithof revealed in 1997: It was 1988 when I first read the book The Dutch in Australia written by Dr Edward Duyker, and his chapters on postwar migration opened my eyes . . . words fail me in trying to describe how I felt when I read . . . Lights went on, veils were lifted and in one instant my feelings were vindicated and all doubts resolved . . . my Australian-ness has been immeasurably richer for my being able to openly and joyfully acknowledge my Dutch heritage as a vital and undeniable part of it . . . nobody is going to steal any part of me ever again. (see Johan Kruithof, A Case of Cultural Theft, in Calwell, S. and Johnson, D. (ed.) Theres More to Life than Sex & Money, Penguin, Ringwood, 1997, p.87.)[24] Ultimately, Edward Duykers writings - including hundreds of articles, reviews and contributions to biographical dictionaries and encyclopaedias  are as diverse as the subjects and disciplines which clearly fascinate him. As Manning Clark put it in his foreword to Of the Star and the Key (1988): 'Edward Duyker . . . has an eye for the things of the mind'. In many respects he has built his readership on his eclectic interests and made a strength of them. CSIRO scientist Richard Groves, for example, asked in the Historical Records of Australian Science (14, 2003): I wonder whom Edward Duyker will choose for his next scholarly biography? Irrespective of who may be chosen, I look forward to reading an equally good yarn told so engagingly, while at the same time being a work of considerable scholarship.[25] The late Professor Greg Dening once described him as 'an historian's historian' (Australian Book Review, June/July, 2003, p. 10).[26] Palmes academiques Chevalier ribbon.svg Centenary Medal (Australia) ribbon.png OrderAustraliaRibbon.png "There was no point in searching for Marion Dufresnes grave...he opened the first French restaurant in New Zealand  the Maori ate him'. "Some would say that I could talk under wet cement. I know at least one property developer who would like to give me the opportunity."
