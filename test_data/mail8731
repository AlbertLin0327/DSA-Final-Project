The Nashville Sounds' 2009 season was the franchise's 32nd year of play. The team finished the regular season with a record of 75 wins and 69 losses. They finished second in their division, which kept them out of the post-season. The Sounds opened their season at the newly-renovated Herschel Greer Stadium on April 9 with a 57 loss against the New Orleans Zephyrs. Before the game, new team owners Masahiro Honzawa, Steve Posner, and Frank Ward, collectively known as MFP Baseball, made speeches welcoming those in attendance. Also speaking was Nashville Mayor Karl Dean. Dean, who was publicly at odds with the team's previous principal ownership group, praised MFP's efforts and commitment to the Sounds and the city of Nashville. In an on-field ceremony, Oak Ridge Boys singer Richard Sterban, a long-time team supporter and minority owner, became the first person to be inducted into the "Ambassador's Club", which recognizes individuals who have shown a long-standing commitment to the Sounds.
