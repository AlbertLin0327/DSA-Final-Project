Aoba-ku (?) is one of the 18 wards of the city of Yokohama in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As of 2010, the ward had an estimated population of 302,643 and a density of 8,610 persons per km. The total area was 35.14km. Aoba is located in eastern Kanagawa Prefecture, and in the northwest corner of the city of Yokohama. The area is largely flatland, with scattered small hills. The area around present-day Aoba Ward was formerly part of Tsutsuki District in Musashi Province. During the Edo period, it was a rural region classified as tenry territory controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate, but administered through various hatamoto. After the Meiji Restoration, the area became part of the new Kanagawa Prefecture in 1868. In the cadastral reform of April 1, 1889, the area was divided into the villages of Tana, Nakazato and Yamauchi in Tsuzuki District (, , , Tsuzuki-gun Tana-mura, Nakazato-mura, Yamauchi-mura?). During the Meiji period, the area was a center for sericulture. On April 1, 1939, the three villages within Tsutsuki District were annexed by the neighboring city of Yokohama, becoming part of Khoku-ku. In a major administrative reorganization of October 1, 1969, Khoku Ward was divided, and the present-day area of Aoba Ward became part of the new Midori-ku. On November 6, 1994, Khoku and Midori Wards were recombined, then re-divided into four new Wards (Khoku, Midori, Tsuzuki and Aoba). The North Branch of the Midori Ward Office in Ichigao became the new Aoba Ward Office. The division and re-division of Wards has much to do with the development of northern Yokohama by railroad companies. The opening of the Tky Den-en-toshi Line and associated "Tama Den-en-toshi" (, Tky Tama Den'en-toshi?) residential communities led to the rapid suburban development in this region. This was followed by the Khoku New Town (, Khoku Nytaun?) project in the 1980s and early 1990s. The core of the Khoku New Town became a significant commercial centre once the subway line extension between Shin-Yokohama and Azamino was completed in 1993. The influx of new population resulted in the entire Khoku New Town being re-organized into the new Tsuzuki Ward. The emblem of Aoba Ward was officially announced on November 6, 1996 to commemorate the birth of Aoba Ward. The emblem was chosen from a number of designs submitted by residents. The trees and different shapes inside the green oval spell "AOBA." The hill symbolizes the geographic location of Aoba Ward. This emblem signifies the warmth that the nature gives to human beings.[1] Aoba Ward is largely a regional commercial center and bedroom community for central Yokohama, Kawasaki and Tokyo. The major commercial centres are around the Aobadai (, Aoba-dai?) and Tama Plaza (, Tama Purza?) stations. The far-northern end of Aoba and the Yamoto River (, Yamoto-gawa?) valley area retained some residual agriculture into the 1990s, when real-estate developers converted much of the farmlands and orchards into subdivisions and condominiums.
