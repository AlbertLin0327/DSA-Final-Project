Dreams and Shadows is a 2009 American drama film written and directed by Tamarat Makonnen as his feature film debut, and stars James Russo and Shawn-Caulin Young.[1] The film had its Los Angeles premiere at the American Film Institute in October 2009.[2] Billy (Shawn-Caulin Young), a teenage outcast drifts into his own vivid imagination to escape his bleak surroundings. His father (James Russo) is a paraplegic whose own dreams of happiness have faded away in an alcoholic haze. In a twisted attempt to find his purpose in life, the teen hatches a plot to seek vengeance on the man who allegedly crippled his father many years ago. However, he soon finds that things aren't always what they seem, as his mission for revenge may ultimately become one for his very own survival. The film was given a rating of 3 out of 5 stars by We are Movie Geeks, who noted that the essence of Dreams and Shadows is "strong" with the film appearing to be something between a "dramatic soap opera and a pulp film noir". They also mentioned that "There are elements of classic storytelling that linger just beneath the surface of Dreams and Shadows, from Oedipus the King to MacBeth".[1] Dreams and Shadows was released on DVD October 12, 2010. It is distributed in the USA and Canada by E1 Entertainment/Synkronized, and includes the behind the scenes featurette The Making of Dreams and Shadows.[3]
