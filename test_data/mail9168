Colby J. Cooper (born January 7, 1976, in Norwich, New York) is the Executive Director of the newly formed Coastal Alabama Leadership Council.[1] Prior to his regional role, Cooper was the Co-Founder and Principal of The Cooper-Lyon Group, LLC, a strategic communications, public relations and operations consulting firm based in Fairhope, Alabama.[2] Prior to launching The Cooper-Lyon Group, Cooper served as Chief of Staff to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University.[3] While in government, Cooper served as a long-time aide to Condoleezza Rice, working in various capacities during his time at the White House and Department of State. As Senior Advisor[4] to the Secretary of State (2007-2008), Cooper assisted in the planning and implementation of the Secretary's major events, as well her domestic and international travels, including coordinating meetings between Secretary Rice and various world leaders. Prior to his stint at the State Department, Cooper served on the National Security Council as Director for Communications and Media Relations (2003-2006) where he coordinated President George W. Bushs foreign media interviews,[5] traveled internationally with the President, and planned the National Security Advisors public appearances and media interviews. Earlier in his tenure at the White House, Cooper served as an Associate Director for Communications (2002-2003), and as an Executive and Administrative Assistant to the National Security Advisor (2001-2002). Prior to joining the White House staff, Cooper worked on the U.S. governments Y2K preparedness and monitoring efforts. On October 19, 2007, Cooper received Bucknell University's inaugural Award for Distinguished Citizenship.[6] On January 23, 2011, the Press-Register published a special editorial from Cooper [7]who writes about the scrutiny our politicians are under 24/7. He opines about the newly elected Alabama Governor, Dr. Robert J. Bentley's choice of words about religion during an event honoring Dr. Martin Luther King when he said, "So anybody here today who has not accepted Jesus Christ as their savior, Im telling you, youre not my brother and youre not my sister, and I want to be your brother. Cooper writes: "Welcome to the big leagues, Governor. Your words, your actions, your body language will be watched, analyzed and commented on, 24 hours a day, for the next four years. This is the price our politicians pay, but it is also the price we the constituents pay. We elect humans, not automatons, into office. It takes time for them to reach the cadence of their new daily political and governing lives. And yet, the reality is that we hold our leaders to such a high standard that the publics patience is usually lost on Day One of governing. I am not suggesting Gov. Bentley should become guarded and contrived. Indeed, I would argue that the fact that he is neither guarded nor contrived appealed to many Alabamians in his election campaign. However, he needs to be more calculated in what he says and he needs to understand the broader ramifications his words now hold  both good and bad, locally and nationally." On August 26, 2010, Cooper delivered the keynote address at the (Mobile, Alabama) Chamber of Commerce's 2010 "Get Connected" Luncheon. He talked about the foundations of the American dream.[8] In his remarks, Cooper made the following comment about education in America: "We need to remind ourselves that education is not Republican or Democrat, it is not White, Black, Hispanic or Asian -- education should not be about the haves and have not -- primary and secondary education in America is, as far as I am concerned, an inalienable right. We cannot let political or bureaucratic complacency, at all levels, keep us from ensuring that every child is given the chance they deserve to take the necessary steps toward accomplishing their goals and dreams. They will be better for it and so will America." On March 14, 2010, Cooper penned a contrarian op-ed[9]for the Press-Register discussing his opposition to a 2010 House Foreign Affairs Committee non-binding resolution (H.Res 252) calling for the heinous acts committed by the Ottoman Empire against the Armenian people, from 1915-1923, to be classified as the Armenian Genocide. In the op-ed, Cooper reveals that he is actually a third generation Armenian-American and shares the plight his great grandparents endured during this time period. Despite his ancestry, he remains opposed to a resolution. "Today, more than ever, the United States must be focused on maintaining and strengthening its strategic partnerships and alliances, not impugning (even if unintentionally) the honor and integrity of our allies for acts committed by generations before them... We will never forget what happened, but we need to be rationale with our current thinking and actions. This Armenian-American is more concerned about the future of the world than trying to rewrite history." On May 12, 2009, Cooper had a Letter to the Editor[10] published in the New York Times defending former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice over comments she made about the Bush Administration's policy on torture that were purportedly taken out of context. Cooper received his B.A. from Bucknell University, where he was a two-time varsity football letter winner.[11] He served on Bucknell University's Alumni Association Board of Directors from 2007-2008. He is married to Jaime Lyon Cooper who is the Co-Founder of their firm, The Cooper-Lyon Group, LLC.[12] They have a son and daughter. He is a native of Oxford, New York.[13]
