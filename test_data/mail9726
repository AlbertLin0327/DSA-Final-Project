t.co is a URL shortening service created by Twitter.[1] It is only available for links posted to Twitter and not available for general use.[1] All links posted to Twitter now use a t.co wrapper.[2] Twitter hopes that the service will be able to protect users from malicious sites,[1] and will use it to track clicks on links within tweets.[1][3] Having previously used the services of third parties TinyURL and bit.ly,[4] Twitter began experimenting with its own URL shortening service for direct messages in March 2010 using the twt.tl domain,[2] before it purchased the t.co domain. The service is being tested on the main site using the accounts @TwitterAPI, @rsarver and @raffi.[2] On September 2, 2010, an email from Twitter to users said they would be expanding the roll-out of the service to users.[3] To shorten a link using the service, add the URL after "http://twitter.com/share?url=" in a browser address bar.
