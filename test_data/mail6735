Prince Albert Northcote is a provincial electoral district for the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, Canada. One of two provincial constituencies for the city of Prince Albert, the riding's southern boundary follows 15th Street South (Hwy. 302) from east to west; then curves south along 9th/10th Street West to 28th Avenue South, which the boundary follows westward until the city limits.
