Country Jam USA is an outdoor country and rock music festival held annual in Grand Junction, Colorado and Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Country Jam USA was formed in Eau Claire, Wisconsin in 1987. In 1990 the first Country Jam was held in Eau Claire. With its success, the ownership and staff expanded west producing the first Colorado Country Jam during 1992 in Grand Junction. The newest product of Country Jam USA was in 2003 with the addition of a Colorado Rock Jam. The Wisconsin Country Jam site is located between the lush forests of west-central Wisconsin and the meandering Chippewa River with camping under the pines or in the lush nearby fields. The Country Jam Ranch is located in Mack, Colorado which is 20 miles from Grand Junction. It is a permanent festival site built for the event with camping on-site.
