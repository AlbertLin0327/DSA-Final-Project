When Forna was six months old the family travelled to Sierra Leone where Mohamed Forna worked as a physician. He later became involved in politics and entered government, only to resign citing a growth in political violence and corruption. Between 1970-3 he was imprisoned and declared an Amnesty Prisoner of Conscience. Mohamed Forna was hanged on charges of treason in 1975.[6][7] The events of Fornas childhood and her investigation into the conspiracy surrounding her fathers death are the subject of the memoir The Devil that Danced on the Water.[8] Forna studied law at University College London and was a Harkness Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley.
