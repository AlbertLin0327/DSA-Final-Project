The Midwest Pipe Band Association is an association of pipe bands in the Midwestern United States. Within its area of jurisdiction, the association includes over forty pipe bands, offers band, solo piping and drumming, and drum major competitions with sanctioned judges, and is responsible for overseeing seasonal competition among its member bands. The official newsletter of the Midwest Pipe Band Association is The Pulse. Individual members of the MWPBA compete in solo piping or snare drumming competitions ranging from novice to professional grades, as novice or advanced tenor drummers, or as drum majors.[1] MWPBA member bands range from grade two to grade five, and are eligible to compete at sanctioned Highland Games throughout the season.[2] At the end of each season, the association is responsible for regrading solo members and bands according to their results, and for announcing the 'Champion Supreme' overall winners of each band, solo piping, and drumming grade.[3]
