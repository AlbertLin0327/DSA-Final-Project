The Technical Group of the European Right was a Far-Right political group with seats in the European Parliament between 1989 and 1994. Following the 1989 elections, the previous far-right Group lost its Ulster Unionist[5] and Greek EPEN MEPs. The situation was further complicated when the perennial problem of the European far-right, its inability to form transnational alliances,[6] reasserted itself when MEPs from the German Republikaner party refused to ally themselves with the Italian MSI due to disagreements over the status of South Tyrol.[7][5] Eventually, the Technical Group of the European Right was formed from MEPs from the French Front National,[6] German Republikaner[5][6] and Belgian Vlaams Blok[5][6] parties. In the 1994 elections, the Republikaners failed to reach the 5% cutoff point for German elections and lost all its MEPs. The Technical Group of the European Right no longer had enough MEPs to qualify as a Group[7] and its MEPs returned to the ranks of the independents.
