Synthespians is a BBC Books original novel written by Craig Hinton (the author's last) and based on the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who. It features the Sixth Doctor and Peri, as well the Autons. As with all Doctor Who spin-off media, its relationship to the televised serials is open to interpretation. The Doctor and Peri land on Reef Station One, an isolated space station that has modelled itself on 1980s popular culture and encounter Autons.
