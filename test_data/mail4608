Vassieux-en-Vercors Coordinates: 445346N 52215E / 44.8961N 5.3708E / 44.8961; 5.3708 Vassieux-en-Vercors is a commune in the department of Drme in southeastern France. The town is known for its assistance to the French Resistance during World War II, for which it was awarded Ordre de la Libration. The village is built on a polje of limestone and dominated by a vast Karst landscape.[1] This polje lies on a syncline generally known as the "Plateau de Vassieux". The Plateau de Vassieux is the site of numerous other karst phenomena, such as limestone pavements and caves, which are studied and explored by local speleology groups. Vassieux-en-Vercors is home to several prehistoric archaeological sites, and has a Museum of Prehistory which was created in May 1970 after the discovery of a flintknapping workshop.[2] For its great acts of resistance during the German occupation of France, the town was awarded the Ordre de la Libration. A memorial was built at the Col de la Chau 445427N 52140E / 44.90760N 5.36124E / 44.90760; 5.36124 to remember the grim events of the Second World War, and includes a cemetery where the victims of a July 1944 German massacre are buried. The main human and economic activities are based on agriculture (livestock, timber etc.) and tourism.
