Rumesh Joseph Ratnayake (born January 2, 1964, Colombo) is a former Sri Lankan cricketer who played in 23 Tests and 70 ODIs from 1982 to 1993. During a career often blighted by injury, Ratnayake was a strapping right arm fast-medium bowler who was capable of swinging the new ball and generating considerable pace and bounce. He was also a more than useful hard-hitting lower order batsman, as Test match fifties against Pakistan and England testify. One of his best performances came in the 1985/86 series against India, taking 20 wickets at 22 for the series. In the 2nd Test he managed 9 wickets in the match which gave Sri Lanka a rare Test win, and inaugural series victory. Other good hauls include 6 for 66 against Australia at Hobart in 1990/91 and 5 for 69 against England at Lords. In July 2001 Ratnayake became the administrative team manager for the Sri Lankan national cricket team.[1] In 2003 Ratnayake was a development officer for the Asian Cricket Council[2] and was a coach and selector for the Asian Dream Team, a composite team of lesser Asian cricketing nations that played 6 matches in Sri Lanka that year.[3] Ratnayake was in May 2007 linked with the Sri Lankan national cricket team assistant coaching job[4] with some saying he had been given the interim coaching job.[5] Ultimately it was the deputy's job that he was offered, and later declined in June 2007.[6]: He has also recently offered his skills advising cricket hopefuls in Canada[7] In August 2011, he became the head coach of Sri Lankan national team.[8]
