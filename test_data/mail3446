St. Patrick's Catholic Church is a Roman Catholic church in San Francisco, California, founded in 1851. It is located at 756 Mission Street, between 3rd and 4th streets, across the street from Yerba Buena Gardens in the heart of the South of Market district. The church features Gothic architecture, with ribbed vaults, pointed arches, a central nave and two side aisles of lower height. The nave follows the basic Gothic pattern with a triforium and clerestory-like top tier. Numerous painted stained glass windows decorate the building. http://www.stpatricksf.org
