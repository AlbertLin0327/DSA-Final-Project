College House College House is a Hall of Residence associated with the University of Canterbury. It is located in Ilam, Christchurch, New Zealand The hall provides accommodation for 152 undergraduate students. It is the oldest hall in New Zealand. Originally founded as part of Christ's College in 1850, the house became independent from Christ's College in 1957. In 1966, the house moved from central Christchurch, to Ilam, as part of the University of Canterbury's relocation to its new Ilam campus. The buildings were designed by Sir Miles Warren and won the Institute of Architects' Gold Medal. In 1990, the College began accommodating female students. Additional buildings were built at this time. College House is unusual among New Zealand halls of residence in that it has a high proportion of returning students; it is common to stay for two years, which helps to maintain many of the College's traditions. There are a variety of long-standing traditions, among them Shambles Fortnight, where over a two-week period each house must perform a large prank or 'shambles' on the rest of the College. The College is divided into ten houses, each with distinct identities. The houses are named after various former Principals, bishops, Board members and other places or endowments. To date, the houses are Stanford, Carrington, Wilford, Parr, Warren, Watts Russell, Chichele, Rymer (formerly College), Hardie, and Beadel. College House was founded as the Upper Department of Christ's College and has evolved into an independent Hall of Residence at the University of Canterbury. Upon the establishment of Canterbury College (now the University of Canterbury) College House began to separate from Christ's College. In 1877 the students moved into a house of their own on the east frontage of the Christs College quadrangle. The Reverend F.A. Hare was appointed as the Hulsean-Chichele Professor, Chaplain of Christ's College and Supervisor of the Upper Department. The house became known as Chichele. Canon Stanford was appointed as the first full time principal in 1882 and in 1885 the upper department moved to new premises on the corner of Rolleston Avenue and Cashel Street. College House achieved full separation from Christ's College in 1957. At this time the college was renamed Christchurch College. This name was used until 1981 when the college reverted to using the name College House. For many years College House was run as a teaching institution of the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia. This function was shared with St John's College in Auckland and Selwyn College in Dunedin. Over time the tertiary education and theological aspects of the College drifted apart and theology is now taught by Theology House in Merivale, with the library and chapel being the main physical reminders of the former union. While the current College House has a chaplain and falls under the jurisdiction of the Anglican Diocese of Christchurch, there is no religious requirement for entry. When the University of Canterbury moved from the old site in town to the new site at Ilam, College House was still a male-only institution and was built on the opposite side of small stream from Bishop Julius Hall, the female-only parallel. Both have since become co-educational. The buildings survived the 2010 and 2011 Canterbury Earthquakes with no significant damage. The current college was designed by Warren and Mahoney. The architect's brief was simply to design a college for 120 men.[1] Designed in the early 1960s the buildings feature many elements which formed part of that firm's practice at that time. Reinforced masonry combined with fairfaced concrete beams, as seen in the Dorset St Flats and distinctive roof shapes (particularly on the Dining Hall and Chapel), reminiscent of that on 65 Cambridge Terrace, are prominent features. The chapel itself is particularly distinctive and is known to be one of Sir Miles' favourite examples of the firm's work during his time with the firm. The interior of the chapel ceiling features impressive carpentry, similar to the Harewood Crematorium and the atrium of the New Zealand Chancery in Washington. Warren and Mahoney's design for the College won the Institute of Architect's Gold Medal. During the 1980s the College House Board of Governors, at the instigation of Dr Alex Baird, began building a collection of modern New Zealand art. The collection has grown steadily and now features a number of important works, including 'View' by Shane Cotton, 'Staten Landt' by Bill Hammond and 'You are what you eat' by Richard Killeen. The collection also includes works by Don Binney, Ralph Hotere, Pat Hanly, Michael Smither and Bill Sutton.
