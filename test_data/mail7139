This article is part of the series: Politics and government of Chad The Chadian National Union (Union Nationale Tchadienne or UNT) was a radical Muslim political party founded in 1958 in Chad by Issa Dana, Mahamut Outman and Abba Siddick. Created to lobby the NO-vote to the referendum on Chad's entry in the French Community, the party advocated drastic political reforms, to be achieved if necessary through violence. The party was banned in 1962 when the president Franois Tombalbaye proclaimed the Chadian Progressive Party sole legal party. It survived as a clandestine organization under the leadership of Ibrahim Abatcha, until it merged itself in 1966 with the General Union of the Children of Chad to form the National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT).
