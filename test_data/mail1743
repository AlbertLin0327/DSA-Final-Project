Paul-Marie-Andr Richaud (April 16, 1887February 5, 1968) was a French Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Bordeaux from 1950 until his death, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1958. Paul Richaud was born in Versailles, and there attended the major seminary before going to Rome to study at the Pontifical Gregorian University. Ordained to the priesthood on June 28, 1913, he then finished his studies in 1915. Richaud did pastoral work in Versailles until 1931, when he became its Vicar General and Vice-Assistant General of the French Catholic Action. On December 19, 1933, Richaud was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Versailles and Titular Bishop of Irenopolis in Isauria by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on January 25, 1934 from Bishop Benjamin Roland-Gosselin, with Bishops Pierre-Marie Gerlier and Georges Louis. Richaud was later named Bishop of Laval on July 27, 1938, and Archbishop of Bordeaux on February 10, 1950. Pope John XXIII created him Cardinal Priest of Santi Quirico e Giulitta in the consistory of December 15, 1958. During his tenure at Bordeaux, Richaud expanded parochial schools and gave the laity a more prominent role[1]. He attended the Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965, and was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1963 papal conclave that selected Pope Paul VI. The Cardinal died from a liver ailment[2] in Bordeaux, at age 80. He is buried in Bordeaux Cathedral.
