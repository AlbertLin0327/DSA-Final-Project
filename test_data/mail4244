Gleb Vassielievich Wataghin (November 3, 1899, Birzula, Russian Empire  October 10, 1986, Turin, Italy); was a Ukrainian-Italian experimental physicist and a great scientific leader who gave a great impulse to the teaching and research on physics in two continents: in the University of So Paulo, So Paulo, Brazil; and in the University of Turin, Turin, Italy. Wataghin was hired in 1934 to found with other European physicists the Department of Physics of the recently founded University of So Paulo. There, he was the tutor of a brilliant group of young physicists, such as Csar Lattes, Oscar Sala, Mrio Schenberg, Roberto Salmeron, Marcelo Damy de Souza Santos and Jayme Tiomno. The Institute of Physics of the State University of Campinas, in Campinas, Brazil, was named in his honour, as well as a prize in Physics. He was awarded the Antonio Feltrinelli Prize in 1951 and was national member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, from 1960.[1]
