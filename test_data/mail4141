Prince Julius of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glcksburg[1][2] (14 October 1824, Gottorp, Schleswig, Duchy of Schleswig [1][2] 1 June 1903, Itzehoe, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany[1][2]) was the eighth[1][2] of the ten children of Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glcksburg and Princess Louise Caroline of Hesse-Kassel.[1][2] In 1863, Prince Julius was sent to Greece with his young nephew, Prince Vilhelm of Denmark, who had recently ascended to the throne of Greece as King of the Hellenes, as an advisor. Eighteen months later, the King returned from a walk to discover that, whilst he was out, Julius had invited seven ministers associated with the former, and deeply unpopular, King Otto to the Palace to discuss the removal of Count Sponneck, another of the King's advisors. Indignant at what he saw as an attempt at a palace putsch, the King ordered Julius to leave Greece within one week.[3] Julius contracted a morganatic marriage with Elisabeth von Ziegesar (18561887), daughter of Wolf von Ziegesar, on 2 July 1883. After their marriage, she was styled Countess von Roest.[4]
