My Lost Mexico (1992), by American author James A. Michener, is a nonfiction account of Michener's endeavor to write a big novel about Mexico, in the grand style of his other popular novels, like Hawaii. Michener relates the long journey of a novel which he had begun writing early in his career, but had abandoned, and the manuscript had ultimately been lost. Its discovery 30 years later led to the 1992 bestseller Mexico. My Lost Mexico also includes the never-before published novella The Texas Girls.
