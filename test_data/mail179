The 1998-99 Vancouver Grizzlies season was the Grizzlies fourth season in the National Basketball Association. The Grizzlies were coming off a franchise best record of 19-63 in the 1997-98 season, finishing out of last place for the first time in team history. The Grizzlies first draft pick was Mike Bibby, which was the second overall pick in the draft. The Grizzlies signed free agent Cherokee Parks, who spent the 1997-98 season with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Parks averaged 11.8 points in 73 games with Minnesota. The San Antonio Spurs and Grizzlies made a trade, with Vancouver sending Antonio Daniels to the Spurs for Felipe Lopez and Carl Herrera. Lopez was the Spurs first round draft pick in the 1998 NBA Draft. Due to the 1998-99 NBA lockout, the NBA would see a shortened schedule for the 1998-99 season, as every team would play 50 games, compared to 82 in a normal season. The Grizzlies began the season with their best start in franchise history, as they had a 3-3 record in their first six games, the latest in a season that the club had a .500 record. Vancouver would fall into a bad streak, losing sixteen of their next seventeen games, which included a thirteen game losing streak, to fall out of the playoff picture. Wins would be few and far between for the remainder of the season, as the Grizzlies ended the year with a record of 8-42, which represented a .160 winning percentage, the lowest in team history. Vancouver finished with the worst record in the league for the third time in four seasons. .
