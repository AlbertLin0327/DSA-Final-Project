Content:
On the 24 April 1748 a congress assembled at Aachen (French: Aix-la-Chapelle) for the purpose of bringing to a conclusion the struggle known as the War of Austrian Succession. Between 30 April and 21 May the preliminaries were agreed to between Great Britain, France and the Dutch Republic, and to these Maria Theresa, queen of Bohemia and Hungary, the kings of Sardinia and Spain, the duke of Modena, and the republic of Genoa successively gave their adhesion. The definitive treaty was signed on 18 October, Sardinia alone refusing to accede, because the Treaty of Worms was not guaranteed. Of the provisions of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle the most important were those stipulating for: Spain having raised objections to the Asiento clauses, the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was supplemented by Treaty of Madrid (5 October 1750), by which Great Britain surrendered her claims under those clauses in return for a sum of 100,000.
