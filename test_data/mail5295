Ecomark[1] or Eco mark[2] is a certification mark issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards[3] (the national standards organization of India) to products conforming to a set of standards aimed at the least impact on the ecosystem.[1][4][5][2][6] The marking scheme was started in 1991. One of the purposes of the mark is increasing awareness among the consumers towards reducing environment impact. The mark is issued to various product categories and the development of standards for more products is in progress.
