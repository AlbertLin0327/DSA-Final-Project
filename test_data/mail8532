Delphi Funds is a Norwegian mutual funds manager, established in the mid-1980s as a market analysis and data processing firm. By 1995 the company had shifted its activities to mutual fund- and equity management, and was acquired by the Storebrand group in 2000. Delphi Funds was merged with Storebrand Fondene in 2002 to become part of the Storebrand Asset Management subsidiary[1]. By 2012, Delphi Funds manages six actively managed unconstrained and concentrated long-only mutual funds, of which the global equity fund Delphi Verden, the European equity fund Delphi Europa, and the Nordic equity fund Delphi Norden are open to international investors. Standard & Poor's have assigned AA or A fund ratings to all three funds, citing a distinctive and defined investment process as building a strong track record for the funds[2]. As a fund needs to perform in the top 20% in its category to be considered for an S&P rating, only three other Norwegian fund managers had attained one at the time[3]. The Delphi Verden fund, alongside the until-then Franklin Mutual-managed ODIN Global, was after its first year in operation touted by domestic media as a challenger to the much larger Skagen Global fund, owing to an impressive performance relative to the MSCI World index[4]. Two years later, Morningstar ranked Delphi Verden second out of 2500 global mutual funds, only outperformed by US-based Franklin Mutual Global Discovery[5]. In march 2011, portfolio manager Espen Furnes of Delphi Europa, was ranked as the top Europe equity manager by Citywire, based on total returns over the past five years[6]. Furnes also received the Citywire rating AA, while Delphi Norden-manager yvind Fjell received the rating A; both for 3 year risk-adjusted performance. Approximately 170 managers possess any Citywire rating at any one time[7]. Outside the domestic market, the Delphi Funds only offer their services to institutional clients and professional investors[8].
