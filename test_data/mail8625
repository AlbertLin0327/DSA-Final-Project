"Bye Bye I Love You" was the Luxembourgish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1974, performed (despite the English of the title, although the title phrase is in that language) in French by German-British singer Ireen Sheer. The song is notable in the history of the Contest; it was the very first entry composed by Eurovision veteran Ralph Siegel, who would go on write 19 ESC entries throughout the 70s, 80s, 90s and 2000s - 14 for Germany including 1982 winner "Ein bichen Frieden", 3 for Luxembourg, 1 for Switzerland, Montenegro in 2009 and most recently "The Social Network Song" for San Marino in 2012. "Bye, Bye, I Love You" is a mid-tempo ballad in which Sheer sings about ending a relationship with a man she appears to have met on a holiday. She sings that "I didn't really speak French" and that "you can't say a word in English", but despite the language barrier, the two were able to enjoy a happy relationship for some time. Her lover, however, was not entirely faithful - thus, regardless of her feelings, she ends the relationship. Sheer recorded the song in three languages, French, English and German - all with the title "Bye Bye I Love You". The song was performed ninth on the night (following Sweden's ABBA with "Waterloo" and preceding Monaco's Romuald with "Celui qui reste et celui qui s'en va"). At the close of voting, it had received 14 points, placing 4th in a field of 17. It was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1975 Contest by Graldine with "Toi". Ireen Sheer returned to the Contest in 1978 with "Feuer", then representing Germany, and again in 1985 competing for Luxembourg with "Children, Kinder, Enfants", both songs Ralph Siegel/Bernd Meinunger compositions.
