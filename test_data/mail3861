Mr Damon Hewson Mr Richard Jones CTC Kingshurst Academy (previously The City Technology College, Kingshurst) is an education establishment in Kingshurst, Solihull, England. It was the only City Technology College to offer post-16 students the opportunity to study the International Baccalaureate instead of A-levels. It also offers the options of studying for GNVQs and BTECs in various subjects. Under the name of "The City Technology College, Kingshurst", the establishment opened in 1988 as Britain's first CTC. Mrs Valerie Bragg was the Principal Emeritus. The College has developed a partnership in education, bringing together the world of industry, commerce and education and has very good results. From an all ability intake, 95% of Year 11 students achieved 5 or more GCSEs at grades A* to C or equivalent (2003).[1] The College now accommodates over 1,500[2] students of all abilities from 11 to 19 years of age. The College is situated on the eastern outskirts of Birmingham in the suburb of Kingshurst, North Solihull. The College serves the East Birmingham and North Solihull areas. Kingshurst refers to itself as a "dynamic organisation, continually changing and progressing to meet the demands of the ever changing world".[3] This is in part illustrated by the school motto "Fear not Change". When the College opened, 83% of students in the area were leaving school at 16 with few prospects of employment. As of 2006, more than 80% of the school's children continue with education to post-16, either at Kingshurst or at other colleges. In 2008 the City Technology College, Kingshurst converted to Academy status, with the name changing to CTC Kingshurst Academy. In 2010 refurbishments took place across the whole site and a new D block was built. Technically, CTC Kingshurst Academy is registered as a company limited by guarantee while also being registered as a charity (Registered in England No: 2268092. Registered Charity number 700390).[4] 3E's, a spinout company fully owned by the Kingshurst CTC Trust, was responsible for the formation of the Kingshurst Foundation - a confederation of schools run by the 3E's company. The initial schools in this Federation were King's College, Guildford and Kings International College, Camberley. The CTC Kingshurst Academy offers Post 16 Education for both internal and external candidates who have completed their Secondary Education. CTC Kingshurst Academy offers Vocational Courses (BTECs and National Diplomas) as well as the prestigious International Baccalaureate Diploma.
