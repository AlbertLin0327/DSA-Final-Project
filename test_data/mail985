Trs-os-Montes is a Portuguese wine region located in the Trs-os-Montes e Alto Douro region. The entire wine region is entitled to use the Vinho Regional designation Transmontano VR, while some areas are also classified at the higher Denominao de Origem Controlada (DOC) level under the designation Trs-os-Montes DOC.[1] VR is similar to the French vin de pays and DOC to the French AOC. Located in the northeastern corner of Portugal, the Trs-os-Montes region has vineyards across a wide range of altitudes that produces a vast spectrum of wine. The vineyards in the cooler high altitude produces wines that are light bodied while the lower altitude region produces full bodied, highly alcoholic wines. One of the first wines to gain international attention was the semi-sweet, semi-sparkling wine known as rosado.[2] Douro DOC, which is famous as the Port wine region, is also located in Trs-os-Montes e Alto Douro and could use the former Trs-os-Montes VR designation.[2] However, with the creation of a separate Duriense VR, Douro vineyards are now separate from both the Trs-os-Montes DOC and Transmontano VR.[1] There are three subregions of the Trs-os-Montes region that are entitled to the Trs-os-Montes DOC designation. The names of the subregions may be indicated on the label together with the name Trs-os-Montes, for example as Trs-os-Montes-Chaves. These subregions were initially created as separate Indicao de Proveniencia Regulamentada (IPR) wine regions, and in 2006 were put together as the Trs-os-Montes DOC.[3] The three subregions are: The principle grapes of the Trs-os-Montes region include Bastardo, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Donzelinho, Gewrztraminer, Gouveio, Malvasia Fina, Merlot, Mourisco Tinto, Pinot noir, Rabo de Ovelha, Sauvignon blanc, Semillon, Tempranillo, Tinta Amarela, Tinta Barroca, Tinta Cao, Touriga Francesa, Touriga Nacional and Viosinho.[2]
