1b72, 1b8i, 1du6, 1lfu, 1puf Pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PBX2 gene.[1][2] This gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed member of the TALE/PBX homeobox family. It was identified by its similarity to a homeobox gene which is involved in t(1;19) translocation in acute pre-B-cell leukemias. This protein is a transcriptional activator which binds to the TLX1 promoter. The gene is located within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6.[2] PBX2 has been shown to interact with HOXA9.[3]  This article incorporates text from the United States National Library of Medicine, which is in the public domain.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
