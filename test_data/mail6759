Jos Mara Montes (March 22, 1920  September 2, 2011) was an Argentine prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. Montes was born in Almirante Brown, Argentina and was ordained a priest on December 20, 1958 from the Archdiocese of La Plata. He was appointed Auxiliary Archbishop of the Archdiocese of La Plata on June 15, 1978 as well as titular bishop of Lamdia, and was ordained bishop on August 15, 1978. Montes was appointed to the Diocese of Chascoms on January 19, 1983, where he served until his retirement on July 3, 1996. He was accused of concealment by a Grandmother of the Plaza de Mayo who said he told her in 1977 he knew where her granddaughter was, but Montes said in the court that he did not remember the incident.[1]
