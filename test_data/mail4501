A technical draw is a term used in boxing when a fight has to be stopped because a fighter is unable to continue from an accidental injury (usually cuts) or foul. Draws occur when the bout goes to the scorecards, and the officials can't determine a winner. If a winner is determined, the decision is referred to as a technical decision. Technical draws also occur when a bout has not completed a certain number of rounds (usually four), thereby not making it an "official fight". Most states have eliminated the technical draw decision for bouts that don't go a required distance, and have replaced it with a no contest.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
