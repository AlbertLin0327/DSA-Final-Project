Content:
Gbaya is a dialect cluster spoken by the Gbaya people of CAR and Cameroon (one third the population of the CAR), with a couple thousand in the Republic of Congo and a few in Nigeria. Several varieties have been assigned separate ISO codes, but many of these are mutually intelligible. It is not clear how many languages Gbaya constitutes, or if there is a distinct break from the related Ngbaka and Gbanu languages.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
