Botsford Lake is a lake in the Nelson River drainage basin in Kenora District in northwestern Ontario, Canada. It is about 15 kilometres (9mi) long and 2.2 kilometres (1.4mi) wide, is at an elevation of 356 metres (1,168ft), and lies between the settlements of Superior Junction and McDougall Mills; Rosnel is on the south shore of the lake. The CN transcontinental rail line travels the along the entire south shore. Highway 642 runs west of the lake, and Highway 516 runs approximately parallel to the north shore of the lake at a distance of about 6 kilometres (4mi). The primary inflow and outflow is the Marchington River, coming in at the northeast end of the lake just downstream of McDougall Falls, and exiting at the southwest end a few kilometres upstream of the river's mouth at Abram Lake on the English River.
