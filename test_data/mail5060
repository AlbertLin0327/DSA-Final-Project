Don't speak German? Click here to read a machine-translated version of the German article. Shadowkeep is an role-playing video game and graphical interactive fiction video game with graphics. The game was published by Telarium (formerly known as Trillium), a subsidiary of Spinnaker Software, in the year 1984. It was the first video game that inspired a novel (Shadowkeep, Warner Books 1984 by Alan Dean Foster). In a Gamespy - Interview Shadowkeep was called "a groundbreaking product at the time", "which paved the way for more complex products like Eye of the Beholder and its peers".[1]
