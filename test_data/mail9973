Baron Walpole, of Walpole in the County of Norfolk, is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. The holders of the peerage also held the titles of Baron Walpole, of Houghton in the County of Norfolk, Viscount Walpole and Earl of Orford (second creation) from 1745 to 1797, the title of Earl of Orford (third creation) from 1806 to 1931 and the title of Baron Clinton from 1781 to 1791. Additionally, since 1797 the title is merged with the title of Baron Walpole of Wolterton. The title of Baron Walpole, of Walpole in the County of Norfolk, was created in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1723 for Robert Walpole, in honour of his father, Sir Robert Walpole, known as the first Prime Minister of Great Britain. The peerage was created with remainder, failing male issue of his own, to his brothers Edward Walpole and Horace Walpole, in default thereof to the heirs male of his father, and in default thereof to the heirs male of his grandfather Sir Thomas Walpole. On Sir Robert Walpole's retirement from the House of Commons in 1742, he was himself raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Walpole, of Houghton in the County of Norfolk, Viscount Walpole and Earl of Orford, with remainder to the heirs male of his body. When Lord Orford died in 1745 he was succeeded by his aforementioned son Robert Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole. In 1724 he had married Margaret, who in 1751 became one of the co-heirs to the ancient Barony of Clinton, which fell into abeyance the latter year. In 1760 the abeyance was terminated in her favour, and she became the 15th Baroness Clinton. The second Earl of Orford was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Earl. He notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk from 1757 to 1797. In 1781 he also succeeded his mother as 16th Baron Clinton. Lord Orford never married and on his death the Barony of Clinton became dormant (see the Baron Clinton for later history of this peerage), while the other titles were inherited by his uncle, the fourth Earl. He was a well-known writer and politician. Lord Orford never married either and on his death in 1797 the Barony of Walpole, of Houghton, Viscountcy of Walpole and Earldom of Orford became extinct. However, he was succeeded in the Barony of Walpole according to the special remainder by his cousin Horatio Walpole, 2nd Baron Walpole. The title of Baron Walpole, of Wolterton, was created in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1756 for the politician and diplomat Horatio Walpole. He was the younger brother of Prime Minister Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford. As mentioned above, his son, the second Baron, succeeded his cousin as 4th Baron Walpole in 1797. He had earlier represented King's Lynn in Parliament. In 1806 the Earldom of Orford was revived when he was created Earl of Orford in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His son, the second Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Wigan and King's Lynn. His grandson, the fourth Earl, briefly represented Wigan in the House of Commons. On the death of the latter's nephew, the fifth Earl, the earldom of Orford became extinct. However, the Baronies of Walpole and Walpole, of Wolterton survived, and were inherited by the late Earl's distant relative, the ninth Baron Walpole and seventh Baron Walpole, of Wolterton. He was a descendant of Hon. Thomas Walpole, second son of the first Baron Walpole, of Wolterton. As of 2010[update] the peerages are held by the ninth Barons son, the tenth Baron Walpole and eighth Baron Walpole, of Wolterton. He is one of the ninety hereditary peers who remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act of 1999, and sits as a cross-bencher. The heir to the barony is the 10th Baron's son, Jonathan Robert Hugh Walpole (b. 1967). See the earlier Earls of Orford (1806) list for later holders of this title.
