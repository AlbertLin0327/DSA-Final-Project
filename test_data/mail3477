Christopher Hatton, 1st Viscount Hatton (16321706) succeeded his father, Christopher Hatton, 1st Baron Hatton, as Baron Hatton and also as governor of Guernsey in 1670. He and his family were living in the governor's official residence, Castle Cornet, in 1672 when its keep and some living quarters were destroyed by an explosion; his mother and wife were killed. In 1683, he was created Viscount Hatton, of Gretton. He was married three times, and left daughter Anne (d. 1743) and two sons: William (16901760), who succeeded to his father's titles and estates, and Henry Charles (c. 1700-1762), who enjoyed the same dignities for a short time after his brother's death. When Henry Charles died, the titles became extinct, and the family is now represented by the Finch-Hattons, earls of Winchelsea and Nottingham, whose ancestor, Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham, married Anne, daughter of the 1st Viscount Hatton.
