Kumkum Ek Pyara Sa Bandhan (Hindustani pronunciation:[kmkm]; English: Kumkum: A lovely relationship) was an Indian television soap opera that aired from Monday to Friday at 1.00pm on STAR Plus in India/U.S. and 10:30 am in the UK. Although it was an afternoon soap, certain tracks of Kumkum gained more TRPs than a prime time one. The story took some concepts from some popular Balaji Telefilms soaps such as Ghar Ek Mandir, Kkusum and Kutumb and towards the end it even introduced popular Balaji Telefilms faces Hiten Tejwani and Gauri Pradhan Tejwani in the story. The soap ended on March 13, 2009. This show is ranked number 4 on the list of STAR Plus top 10 shows of all time. It is India's fourth longest running serial. The story falls under family-drama category but can be called more as the love story of the two main characters, SumitKumkum. SumitKumkum are considered to be one of STAR Plus's most favourite couples. A huge part of the success of the serial was credited to the chemistry shared by the leads: Hussain Kuwajerwala and Juhi Parmar. The soap opera tells the tale of the Wadhwa family and its daughter-in-law, Kumkum. She is happily married to Jatin. However, he dies of a brain tumour while she is expecting their first child. The Wadhwas decide to get their young daughter-in-law re-married to an eligible young man. However, when obstacles arise to prevent that marriage, Jatin's younger brother Sumit impulsively marries Kumkum in order to save her from social disgrace. The new relationship between Kumkum and Sumit begins as a compromise but ripens into deep love. They face many problems but stay together. They bring up their three children-- Dhruv (whose biological father is Jatin), Sharman and Ashka. Then Kumkum and Sumit Wadhwa die. They are reborn, with Sumit being very shy and living with a big family in Delhi and Kumkum being a fun-loving prankster living with her family in a village. Both hate each other after meeting in college but, due to circumstances, they have to pretend to be married in front of their families. In this life, too, their love passes through many trials and challenges. After all the problems are solved, Kumkum and Sumit live happily ever after. Kumkum Wadhwa is the favourite daughter-in-law of the Wadhwa family. First, she is married to Jatin; after his death she is engaged to Vishal. For some reason Vishal's parents call off the wedding. In the hustle-bustle Sumit gets angry and confused; he applies "sindur" in the parting of Kumkum's hair, making them husband and wife by tradition. Later on they have three kids: Dhruv, Sharman and Aashka. Suddenly Kumkum faces a huge problem  so huge that it becomes the reason for her death. But again Kumkum is back after her reincarnation as a lively prankster, Kumkum Mishra. Even in this incarnation, she kind of starts "liking" Sumit (also re-incarnated as Sumit Raichand). Because of some complications, Kumkum has to live with Sumit as his wife. She helps him in many ways. She falls in love with Sumit, but doesn't want to admit it since Sumit's father, Om Raichand, insulted her and her father, Chandu Mishra. Sumit Wadhwa, the younger brother of Kumkum's first husband Jatin, is engaged to Renuka. But after Jatin's death, he marries Kumkum while Renuka is away. He has much trouble winning Kumkum's love. However, after many complications, Kumkum and Sumit fall in love. Then they try to overcome the problems that affect their children. After his death and subsequent reincarnation, Sumit is the son of Om Raichand. In this incarnation, Sumit grows up deprived of the love of his father. When Sumit falls in love with Kumkum his father does not agree to their wedding. Then Sumit has to be on the run along with Kumkum.
