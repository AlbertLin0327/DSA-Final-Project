Laishram Monika Devi (born 1 March 1983) is an Indian weightlifter from Manipur who won the silver medal in the Women's 69 kg category at the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Monika was originally part of the Indian squad for the 2008 Summer Olympics in women's 68 kg category, but was dropped after the Weighlifting Federation stated that she was tested positive in a dope test. But the Prime Minister's Office overruled this decision. But because the final list of participants had already been submitted to the Olympics officials, Monika could not take part in the Games. After being cleared of doping charges, Monika competed in the Women's 69 kg category at the 2010 Commonwealth Games where she managed to win a bronze medal. Monika's name was dragged into three controversies regarding the Indian representation in the weightlifting event at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Monika was shortlisted for the Indian representation at the 2008 Olympics, along with Shailaja Pujari. There were allegations that the weightlifting federation officials were bribed to pick Shailaja for an Olympic berth. The sports ministry intervened in the matter and asked the officials to hold the final selection trials in Patiala instead of Pune. But the federation shifted the venue to Bangalore. However, when the list was officially announced, Monika got the selection ahead of Shailaja. Shailaja was announced a reserve. Monika's selection was unanimous.[1] The weightlifting federation announced that Dev Dutt Sharma will coach Monika at the 2008 Olympics. This decision is also a breach of the sports ministry's directive that a woman coach should accompany a woman weightlifter to the Olympics.[2] The Weighlifting Federation stated that Monika was tested positive in a dope test conducted in India prior to the Olympics. Subsequently she was omitted from the Indian squad for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. But she protested to this stating that the officials have been trying to discard her in favour of another weightlifter Shailaja Pujari.[3] But since the statement from the Federation lacked any credibility, the Prime Minister's Office intervened and approved her participation in the Olympics. But because the list of participants was already submitted to the Olympic authorities, the Indian Olympic Association stated that Monika cannot take part in the Olympics.[4] Thus she was omitted from the Indian contingent. In March 2009, Press Trust of India (PTI) reported that Monika's B sample which was sent to a WADA-accredited laboratory in Tokyo was also returned positive.[5] The reported indicated that she could be banned for two years. Monika reacted to this news by saying that she did absolutely nothing wrong. She alleged that there is a huge conspiracy to end her sporting career prematurely.[6] Later, her family accused PTI of reporting incorrect information regarding the B sample result. A family member stated that Monika has not received any such reports yet.[7] Monika's sister L. Mamta stated in a press meet in Manipur that Monika is going to sue PTI.[8]
