 Appearances (Goals). Christos Bourbos (Greek:  ) (born 1 June 1983 in Ioannina) is a Greek football player who plays for OFI Crete in the Beta Ethniki.[1] He played in PAS Giannina for three seasons (20012004) playing as a striker. After his move to AEK Athens head coach Fernando Santos wanted to make him a right back. As a result, in one of his latest interviews, he stated that his natural position is that of the right back. In his first season in AEK Athens, he was an indispensable member of the club (as well in Greece under 21), contributing with many assists. An injury in 2005, deprived him from playing in the starting 11, hence in season 2005/2006 having just 2 appearances (in the Greek Cup). In 20062007, Lloren Serra Ferrer having 2 other Right Defenders (Nikolaos Georgeas and Martin Albano Pautasso) proposed him a loan move, at first, to Niki Volou (a Second Division team). However, Bourbos refused. But just a few hours before the transfer window deadline Kerkyra made an offer for Bourbos' loan, including his annual wage, managing to loan him for the rest of the season.
