Teo Usuelli (December 13, 1920 - April 13, 2009) was an Italian composer. Born in Reggio Emilia in 1920, he studied music at the Conservatorio Giuseppe Verdi in Milan, where he was graduated in choral music and composition. During the Second World War, he had fought in Italian partisans, then he moved to Rome, where he began his career as composer.[1] He is probably best known for the main theme of the giallo film Amuck!, "Piacere Sequence", that was later used in The Big Lebowski, in an episode of the tv-series Spaced and in the documentary film How to Draw a Bunny. He frequently worked with directors Marco Ferreri (Dillinger Is Dead, The Conjugal Bed, The Ape Woman, Controsesso, The Man, the Woman and the Money, The Seed of Man, L'udienza) and Marcello Baldi. His musical scores include Il fischio al naso, Kult ciala, Strogoff, Operation Atlantis.
