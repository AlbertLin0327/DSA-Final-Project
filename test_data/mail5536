New Technology High School @ GHS is a public high school in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States. It is one of five small schools located on the Garinger campus of schools in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools. The principal of New Tech is Mr. Barry Blair. There are currently over 20 teachers and about 450 students. New Technology High School at Garinger was established in 2006 as a part of the closing of Garinger High School in 2009. Modeled after the New Technology High School in Napa, California, the school opened in 2006 with a class of 91 ninth graders[2] and added a grade with each successive year. The school's first graduating class will be the class of 2010. New Technology High School at Garinger is the result of a joint vision by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, The New Tech Network, the New Schools Project, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. New Technology High School shares the Garinger campus with four other new small schools: Math and Science High School, International Studies High School, Business and Finance High School and Leadership and Public Services High School. Our new school will use a national reform model provided by the New Technology Foundation to provide a real-world, 21st Century education to students who choose to enroll at the New Technology High School at Garinger. This model encompasses virtually all national reform initiatives: School to Career education, Standards Based Curriculum, Curricular Integration, Professional Development for Teachers, and Technology Preparation.
