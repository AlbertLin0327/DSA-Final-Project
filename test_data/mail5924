Frederick Brunning Maddison (22 July 1849  25 September 1907) was an English footballer who played for England as a midfielder in the first international match against Scotland, as well as winning two FA Cup medals with Oxford University in 1874 and with The Wanderers in 1876. Later he was a music publisher and, together with his wife the composer Adela Maddison, was closely associated with the French composer Gabriel Faur.[1] He was born in London as Frederick Patey Chappell and was educated at Marlborough Royal Free Grammar School before going up to Oxford University, where he was a member of Brasenose College. Although he went on to represent the university, he did not win a "blue". He played for Scotland in the third of the unofficial matches prior to the first official international match, a 11 draw on 25 February 1871[2] playing under the pseudonym "F. Maclean".[3] He won his solitary England cap playing on the left of midfield in England's first ever international match against Scotland on 30 November 1872.[4] In February 1873 he assumed his new name (although in many match reports he is referred to as Frederick Chappell-Maddison) and was part of the Oxford University team that reached the final of the second FA Cup tournament. In the final against The Wanderers, on 29 March 1873, the University were defeated 20. The following year, the University again reached the final and (with Maddison now on the right) this time they were successful, defeating the Royal Engineers by two goals to nil. Maddison was involved in the move which resulted in the second goal, when he, together with Cuthbert Ottaway and Robert Vidal, "dribbled their way to the Engineers' goal, where Frederick Patton was waiting to slide the ball between the posts."[5] After leaving university he played for The Wanderers and again reached the FA Cup Final in 1876. After a 1-1 draw in the first match against the Old Etonians, the Wanderers were victorious in the replay which ended 3-0. This was the first year of the Wanderers' 'hat-trick' of final victories. Maddison also played for amateur club Crystal Palace (not the later professional club) and the Civil Service, and in representative matches for London and The South versus The North.[6] In 1876, Maddison became a barrister and was called to the bar, but in 1884 he was disbarred at his own request, so that he could practice as a solicitor. On 14 April 1883 he married Katharine Mary Adela Tindal, at Christ Church, Lancaster Gate, London.[7] They had twochildren, Diana Marion Adela and Noel Cecil Guy,[8] born in 1886 and 1888 respectively. His wife was a composer, usually known as Adela Maddison.[9] From around 1894, the couple played a major part in encouraging and facilitating the entry onto the London musical scene of the French composer Gabriel Faur.[10] Frederick was then working for a music publishing company, Metzler, which obtained a contract to publish Faur's music during 18961901. Faur was a friend of the family and in 1896 vacationed at their residence in Saint-Lunaire, Brittany.[1] From 1898 Maddison and his wife lived separately, with Adela residing in Paris;[9] she may have had a romantic liaison with Faur.[1] Frederick Maddison died in Germany on 25 September 1907, at Moabit Hospital, Berlin.[6]
