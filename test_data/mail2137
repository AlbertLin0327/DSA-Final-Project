Mittelndorf is a village in Saxony, Germany, situated in the district of Schsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge. It is one of the villages who compose the municipaity of Kirnitzschtal. The oldest structure of the village is the mill (Mittelndorfer Mhle)[1], built in 1518. Mittelndorf is located in the mountain range of Saxon Switzerland, not too far from the river Kirnitzsch. It lies on the road S 154, between the villages of Altendorf and Lichtenhain (both part of Kirnitzschtal). It lies 8 km from Sebnitz (in north) and Bad Schandau (south), 25 from Pirna, 27 from Dn (in the Czechia) and circa 50 from Dresden. Mittelndorf has got a rail stop on the DB line Pirna/Bautzen-Neustadt in Sachsen-Sebnitz-Bad Schandau ("Sebnitztalbahn"), situated in the forest close to the village. This stop has a rare peculiarity for a train station situated on a normal[2] national rail line: it has not a road to reach it but a simple forest trail. A similar thing in Europe could be found, for example, in the stations of Kloster Marienthal (Engers-Au line, Germany); Pertosa, in southern Italy; or Corrour, in Scotland. The village is also served by the suburban tramway line "Kirnitzschtalbahn" Bad Schandau-Lichtenhainer Wasserfall[3], with the stops of Mittelndorfer Mhle (at the mill) and Forsthaus, not too far from Mittelndorf.
