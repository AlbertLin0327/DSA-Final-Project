 Appearances (Goals). Krisztin Nmeth (Hungarian pronunciation:[kistian nemt]; born 5 January 1989) is a Hungarian international football player who currently is playing for RKC Waalwijk. Born in Gyr, Nmeth started his career at hometown club Gyr where he played from 2003 to 2005 as a youth player. In 2005 he signed for MTK Hungria, with whom he scored 18 goals in 37 league games and helped the club to finish as runners-up in the Hungarian National Championship I in 200607. He signed a three-year contract with Liverpool, alongside Andrs Simon in the summer of 2007. He was regarded by the club as an upcoming talent and had been tipped for a bright future at the Merseyside club, who stated on their official site that "big things are expected of Nmeth."[1] Though he is mostly used as a striker, he often drops into a deeper position during games, where he is able to take advantage of the additional space to make his trademark backheel passes.[citation needed] Nmeth scored twice on his debut for Liverpool Reserves on 27 November 2007 against Manchester City.[1] A week later, he scored twice in a 30 win against Everton Reserves at the Halliwell Jones Stadium.[1][2] He scored a fifth goal in three games against Middlesbrough Reserves sending Liverpool to the top of the Premier Reserve League North. He later started for the reserves against Sunderland Reserves and lobbed the keeper giving Liverpool the win and sending them five points clear at the top of the league. In April 2008, Nmeth scored the only goal of the game against Blackburn Rovers Reserves which secured the Premier Reserve League North title. On 7 May, he scored the first goal as the Reserves beat Aston Villa reserves 30 at Anfield to clinch the Premier Reserve League national title.[1][3] He was the Premier Reserve League North Top scorer in the 200708 season. His impressive displays in the latter half of the season earned him recognition as Liverpool Fans' Reserves Player of the Year for the 200708 season. On 30 July Nemeth was a second-half substitute in Liverpool's pre-season friendly against Villarreal where he almost gave Liverpool the lead but the shot went just over the crossbar. On 2 August Nemeth was introduced as a second half substitute in another pre-season friendly against Rangers. His shot was saved on 58 minutes but tapped in by Yossi Benayoun. Then on 70 minutes he was fouled in the penalty area and Xabi Alonso scored the resulting penalty. Also on 2 August, Hungarian national team coach Erwin Koeman urged Nemeth to go on loan to a Championship club to gain experience. Nemeth rejected the chance to play for League One club Leeds United stating that he wanted to get into coach Rafa Benitez' first team plans.[citation needed] Nmeth was handed the number 29 shirt for the 200809 season, previously he had no official first team number.[4] On 26 January 2009, he signed for Championship club Blackpool in a one-month loan deal.[5][6] A day later, he made his debut for the Seasiders as a 59th-minute substitute at Bloomfield Road, creating their best chance by teeing up David Fox. Blackpool lost 30, and it was discovered afterwards that he had fractured his cheek bone when he clashed with a QPR defender just 60 seconds into his debut.[7][8] Nmeth was one of several reserve players brought along for the pre-season friendlies, where he started the games against St Gallen, Rapid Vienna and Thailand. He then scored a brace against Singapore in a 50 victory.[9] Due to injuries, Nmeth was not able to fulfil his potential at Liverpool, and subsequently moved to Olympiakos on a permanent deal following his loan spell at AEK Athens. It was announced by Liverpool on 25 August 2009 that he would spend the 200910 season on loan to AEK Athens. After visiting AEK for the first time, he said he is looking forward to the challenge saying "I am coming to a big club and a great city." He then laid out his ambitions stating "I hope we can win the championship."[10] On 30 August, he made his debut coming on as a first half substitute against Atromitos. He assisted Ismael Blanco for the only goal of the game with a great run, and was a constant threat to the Atromitos defence throughout. As a result of this, he was voted the MVP in the Super Liga for that week. On 20 September, he scored his first goal for AEK, netting in a 11 draw with PAS Giannina. Later that week on 23 September, he scored another goal in a 12 defeat to fierce rivals Olympiacos F.C.. Upon returning from the FIFA U-20 World Cup, he featured in every match before the international break, most notably the 31 victory against Larissa on 9 November where he scored a header after being introduced as a half time substitute.[11] As the season entered 2010, Nemeth struggled with an ankle injury picked up on international duty. This forced him out of several months, as he returned only for the last few games of the season, where he appeared mainly as a substitute. In the final game of the regular season against Asteras Tripolis, he provided both assists in a 20 home win, ensuring AEK went into the play-offs as the third placed team. Throughout the season Nemeth produced more assists than goals, meaning his contribution to AEK was still important, and helped them secure second place in the play-offs. On 19 August 2010, Olympiacos F.C. announced that they had concluded a deal with Liverpool to sign Nmeth on a 3 year deal. The fee was originally 1.3m, but later the fee was reduced to 1m. There is a clause in his Olympiacos contract that states Liverpool are due 25% of any future sale of the player by Olympiacos F.C..[12] The deal was confirmed by Olympiacos F.C. on 23 August.[13] Nmeth never made a competitive first-team appearance for Liverpool, despite playing for them in pre-season. On the 3 November, Nmeth made his debut for Olympiacos, playing the full 90 minutes in a 10 win against Ilioupoli F.C. in a Greek Cup tie. 3 days later on the 6th, Nemeth made his League debut for Olympiacos, assisting Marko Panteli for the 4th goal within minutes of coming on in a 50 thrashing of Panionios. On 2 September in 2011, he terminated his contract with Olympiacos. In 28 January, he joined Olympiacos Volos on a 6-month loan. Nmeth scored his only goal for Olympiacos Volos against Panserraikos in the 15th minute.[14] Finally, his team won the match by 3-0. At the end of the championship Nmeth returned to Olympiakos Pireus and in the summer of 2011 he ended his contract with the Greek giant club. On 4 November 2011 Nmeth signed a half-year contract with MTK Budapest FC. He previously played for the Hungarian club. Nmeth did not want to join any other Hungarian club except for MTK. Therefore he returned to his first club in order to help them back to the first division of the Hungarian League. Nmeth scored the only goal during his return to MTK against Soproni VSE in the 58th minute.[15] On 26 January Nemeth signed a six-month contract at RKC Waalwijk.[16][17] Nmeth scored his first goal in the Eredivisie against Vitesse in the 37th minute and the match ended with 1-0 victory.[18][19] On 17 March Waalwijk beat De Graafschap by 1-0 thanks to Nmeth's goal in the 78th minute[20] Nmeth was a part of the Hungary under-17 squad that reached the 2006 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship finals in Luxembourg. His first half hat-trick against Sweden under-17s on 30 March 2006 secured the Hungarians a place at the finals with a 40 win.[21] He scored two goals in the finals in Luxembourg as Hungary were knocked out in the group stages. He was named in the Hungarian under-17 Team of the Year in 2006. In 2007 he was named in the under-18 "Team of Europe". In 2008 he was named in the Hungarian under-19 Team of the Year. In May 2008 he scored the goal against Portugal under-19s that put the Hungary under-19's through to the 2008 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship. He was also called up to the Hungarian senior squad[1] and was an unused substitute in their 11 draw with Croatia. On 14 July he scored the only goal in Hungary under-19s 10 victory over Bulgaria under-19s in their first group game at the UEFA Under-19 European Championships at the FK Viktoria Stadion in Prague, Czech Republic.[22] He also played in their victory over Spain under-19s on 17 July as Hungary qualified for the semi-finals and Nmeth played in the 10 loss to Italy under 19s on 23 July.[23] He scored seven goals in three matches for the Under-19s in a mini-tournament in Cyprus. In September 2009, he was called up to the Hungary U-20 squad for the FIFA U-20 World Cup. He played in two of three group matches, scoring once against United Arab Emirates to help Hungary finish top.[24] On 9 October, he played in Hungary's quarter-final match against Italy. With the game level at 11 in extra time, he scored to make it 21 to the Hungarians, though Italy were quick to equalise. With just 3 minutes left of extra time, he latched onto a through ball from Vladimir Koman and slotted coolly past the 'keeper to secure Hungary's place in the semi-finals.[25] In the semi-finals though, he was substituted at half-time in a 32 loss to Ghana.[26] His tournament ended on a high however, winning a 90th minute penalty in the third-place playoff match against Costa Rica, taking the game to extra time after Vladimir Koman converted. He then went on to score one of only two penalties in the shootout to seal third place for Hungary.[27] On 13 November 2009 in a qualification match for the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship he scored his first U21 goal after a reverse pass from clubmate Andrs Simon, as Hungary beat Italy 20.[28] On 14 May 2010, Nmeth was called up to Hungary for the friendly matches against Germany and The Netherlands. On 29 May, he made his international debut for Hungary as he came on as a substitute against Germany in the 61st minute. As correct of 10 April 2012
