The Bouchia Clawed Frog (Xenopus pygmaeus) is a species of frog in the Pipidae family. It is found in Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and possibly Republic of the Congo. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, swamps, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marches, rural gardens, and heavily degraded former forest.
