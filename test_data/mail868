God's Wonderful Railway was a children's drama TV series made by the BBC. There were eight 30-minute episodes, originally screened from 6 February 1980. The first half of the series was set in the early 1900s when George Grant, played by child actor Ian Sandy, starts work as a lad porter at Highley on the Great Western Railway. The second half of the series was set during World War II when Grant, played by Colin Douglas, had become station master at Arley. The series was written by Avril Rowlands with episodes directed by Fiona Cumming and John Prowse. The location filming was done on and around the Severn Valley Railway, a musical reference being made to the area with the opening and closing credits being backed by the first movement of The Severn Suite. Avril Rowlands adapted the scripts into a series of juvenile fiction books. God's Wonderful Railway at the Internet Movie Database
