Adrian Harewood is a Canadian television and radio journalist, and the anchor of CBOT's CBC News: Ottawa at 5/5:30/6 and CBC News: Late Night in Ottawa. An Ottawa native, Harewood attended Ashbury College, a private school in Rockliffe, where he was headboy. Harewood volunteered for CKCU-FM and CHUO-FM before moving to Montreal, earning a degree from McGill University in political science and becoming a programmer and station manager for CKUT-FM. At CKUT, he hosted a weekly program, Soul Perspective, about Black Canadian issues. Notably, he devoted several episodes of the program to the issue of homophobia in the black community after a performance poetry night at which poet Judge Dread Mathematik performed a work which some audience members felt was homophobic.[1] He later joined CBC Radio, becoming a journalist and substitute host on CBLA-FM in Toronto, before being named the permanent host of CBO-FM's All in a Day in 2006.[2] He remained in that role until September 2009, when he joined CBC News: Late Night.
