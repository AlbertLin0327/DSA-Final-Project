Giuseppe Miggiano was born October 16, 1938 in a small town in Puglia in southern Italy named Tuglie. In 1946 his father decided to come looking for work in the region of Charleroi in Belgium, like many Italian immigrants at these time. Giuseppe in parallel of technical studies that leads in Charleroi, are also interested in sculpture and painting.Student at the Academy of Arts in Charleroi, it will become one of the most productive and original representant. His work take many forms: sculpture, kinetic sculpture, painting etc. ...The choice of materials is to be compared with the industrial environment present in the Hainaut region, a mixture of technology, various forms of metal all wrapped in a mysterious sort of poetry makes all of his work as coming from another unknown civilization of this world. Some of these achievements can also be contemplated in the Charleroi region, we note particularly his "Perseus" at the cultural center of Couillet and its "Gate of Eternity" present at the Gilly crematorium.[1] On note to finish the imposing metal ball enthroned in the middle of the square Jumet, these installation are commemorating the Battle of Fleurus in 1974 (Year II of the first French republic), won by General Jourdan. He is referenced in the Flamish theartserver - the site who reference most significant artist in Belgium.[2] Belgium and international exposition: Charleroi, Bruxelle ,Mons,Mouscron,Knoccke,Moscou and Pittsburgh , l'exposition international de Bois du Luc.
