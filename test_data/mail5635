Arab Communist Party (Arabic:    Al-Hizb Al-Shuyu'i Al-'Arabi) was a communist party in Syria, emerging as a pro-Chinese split from the Syrian Communist Party. The party was founded in February 1968.[1] The party was harshly repressed during the 1970s, and many of its activists were imprisoned. As of 2001[update] several of its cadres remained in Syrian jails.[2][3]
