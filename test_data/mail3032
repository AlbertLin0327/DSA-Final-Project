Le Vibrazioni (engl. The vibrations) is an Italian rock and pop band formed in Milan in 1999 that is still active. Its albums were issued by BMG. They made their breakthrough in 2003 with their debut single Dedicato a te, which went platinum. The four founding members, all born in Milan or its metropolitan area, are Francesco Sarcina, author and composer Stefano Verderi, guitarist and keyboardist, Marco Castellani, bassist, and Alessandro Deidda, drummer. After some years spent playing in Milan clubs without publishing any songs, the group manages to debut on the marked with the single 'Dedicato a te', which soon become a Disco di Platino. After this they publish their first album, 'Le Vibrazioni', whose sales exceed 300,000 copies and from which the singles 'In una notte d'estate', 'Vieni da me', 'Sono pi sereno' and '...E se ne va' were extracted. This latter song will become part of the soundtrack of the movie 'Tre metri sopra il cielo'. 2003 - Dedicato a te (ITA #1) / Video 2003 - In una notte d'estate / Video 2003 - E se ne va / Video 2003 - Vieni da me / Video 2004 - Sono pi sereno / Video 2005 - Raggio di sole (ITA #3) / Video 2005 - Ovunque andr / Video 2005 - Angelica 2005 - Aspettando / Video 2005 - Ogni giorno ad ogni ora / Video 2006 - Fermi senza forma (online only, on the website MtvOverdrive) / Video 2006 - Se / Video 2007 - Portami via / Video 2007 - Dimmi / Video 2008 - Drammaturgia / Video 2008 - Insolita / Video 2008 - Su un altro pianeta / Video 2010 - Respiro / Video 2010 - Senza indugio / Single 2010 - Invocazioni al cielo / Video 2010 - Va cos / Single
