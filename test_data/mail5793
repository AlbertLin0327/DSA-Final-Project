Regular Show is an American animated television series created by J. G. Quintel (formerly a creative director for The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack). The series was originally developed as a short for Cartoon Network's unaired Cartoonstitute show, and features characters loosely based on those from Quintel's student films The Nave Man from Lolliland and 2 in the AM PM. It was green-lit on August 13, 2009 by Cartoon Network[2] and debuted on September 6, 2010. The series was renewed for a third season in late 2010 and premiered on September 19, 2011. "Stick Hockey" began the show's third season. On October 26, 2011, it was announced that Regular Show had been renewed for a fourth season.[3] The series had made its Canadian premiere on Teletoon, on May 5, 2012, in favor of the launch of Cartoon Network Canada.[4] Two 23-year-old friends,[5] a blue jay named Mordecai and a raccoon named Rigby, are employed as groundskeepers at a park and spend their days trying to slack off and entertain themselves by any means. This is much to the chagrin of their boss Benson and their co-worker Skips, but to the delight of Pops. Their other co-workers Muscle Man (an overweight green man) and High Five Ghost (a ghost with a hand extending from the top of his head) serve as rivals to Mordecai and Rigby.[6] The show usually revolves around Mordecai's and Rigby's attempts to avoid work and enjoy themselves; however, they oftentimes have to pay for their irresponsible actions, as they always get into more trouble than they thought. This typically results in Mordecai and Rigby going through bizarre and surrealistic misadventures. Season 1 began on September 6, 2010 with the episode "The Power" and ended on November 22, 2010 with "Mordecai and the Rigbys". There was a pilot of the series that aired on Cartoon Network Video, an extended remake was aired on July 11, 2011. Season 2 began on November 29, 2010 with "Ello Gov'nor" and ended on August 1, 2011 with "Karaoke Video". Furthermore, the series has been renewed for a 40-episode third season and premiered on September 19, 2011 with the episode "Stick Hockey". Region 1 Devin D. O'Leary of Alibi.com's "Idiot Box" column gave the show a favorable review, saying that its theme felt like a workplace sitcom and that the "parade of super-strange characters" added to the show's humor. He compared the show to Beavis and Butt-head.[11] PopMatters critic Chris Conaton gave the show a six-out-of-ten rating, saying that it was "mildly amusing." His review praised Quintel's and Salyers' voice acting, but thought that the humor was derivative of Beavis and Butt-Head and The Ren & Stimpy Show.[12] Common Sense Media reviewer Melissa Camacho said the show to be "pretty edgy for non-Adult Swim Cartoon Network fare" due to its fantasy violence, sexual content and language but also said that "viewers who are into creative animation will definitely appreciate the wit featured here, and gave it three stars out of five."[13] Metacritic gave Regular Show an 8.8 rating, with the rank of "universal acclaim". 25 critics reviewed the show, with most of them praising the comedy, risque humor, animation and characters. [14] Jeopardy! has featured Regular Show as an answer for the question "A 6-foot tall blue jay named Mordecai and Rigby the raccoon are best buds on this Cartoon Network offering".[15] In the Problem Solverz episode "Hamburger Cavez" stylized versions of Mordecai and Rigby are seen eating Horace and Roba's hamburgers. A clip from the episode "Brain Eraser" was shown on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. The sketch comedy series MAD has featured "Regular Show" several times. Mordecai and Rigby have appeared in the sketches "The Social Netjerk" and "RiOa", and Benson has also appeared as Zach Galifianakis without his makeup. Mordecai and Rigby appeared as presenters during the 2012 Hall of Game Awards on Cartoon Network.
