New Horizons is the name of a Country music album by Dottie West, released in 1983. This was another unsuccessful album for Dottie West. Her chart success continued to spiral downward, as the result of poor record sales from her previous album, as well as this album. This was the last album released by West under Liberty records (formerly titled "United Artists", but was changed to Liberty in 1980). A single from the album, "Tulsa Ballroom" became West's last Top 40 Country hit in her solo career. The other single from the album, "The Night Love Let You Down", didn't chart, her first single not to do so since her career on major labels began in 1963. The album did chart on the "Top Country Albums" chart (this would be West's last chart appearance on the "Top Country Albums" chart), but didn't go farther than No. 65. West was 50 at the time and although a highly popular concert artist her mainstream success on records was fading out like several of her other contemporaries, being overtaken by a new generation of stars.
