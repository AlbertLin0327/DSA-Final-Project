Andrus Veerpalu (born 8 February 1971 in Prnu) is a former and so far the most successful Estonian male cross country skier. On 17 February 2006 he won his second Winter Olympics gold medal (in 15km cross country skiing; his previous gold medal is from the Salt Lake City games), becoming the fourth Estonian to have won two Olympic gold medals (Kristjan Palusalu, Erika Salume and Kristina migun-Vhi are the first three). He is the most successful Olympic athlete from Estonia with three medals. (Kristina migun-Vhi tied that record at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics) Veerpalu has also found success at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, winning a gold at 15km in 2009 at Liberec, 30km in 2001 at Lahti and a silver at 50km in 1999 at Ramsau. He has also won the 50km event at the Holmenkollen ski festival in 2003 and 2005. Veerpalu also competed in the men's 50km, Mass Start Classic at the 2010 Winter Olympics, finishing at the 6th place. Andrus Veerpalu became the oldest world champion in history with his victory at Liberec 2009 on the 15km classical event. He was then 38 years old.[1] He is also the oldest Olympic champion in individual distance. Veerpalu earned the Holmenkollen medal in 2005, the first Estonian to do so. Veerpalu is the fourth athlete to compete in cross-country skiing at six Winter Olympics, after Marja-Liisa Kirvesniemi, Harri Kirvesniemi, and Jochen Behle. (Kateina Neumannov is also a cross-country skier who competed at six Olympics, but one of her appearances was in cycling.) On 23 February 2011, Veerpalu announced that he will end his professional sportsman career.[2] Although Veerpalu's team first claimed medical issues (knee injury and/or flu), later in that year it was announced that Veerpalu tested positive for HGH (growth hormone) but pleaded innocent in HGH treatment. Estonian biochemistry doctors explained that the verdict was untimely and that there was no reliable method to distinguish artificial HGH from natural background hormone.[3][4][5] Veerpalu appealed the test result to the FIS and is ready to turn to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.[6] The FIS antidoping commission founded Veerpalu guilty and extended his ban to three years, due to Veerpalu's team's lack of co-operation with FIS.[7] A group of top Estonian biochemists investigated the matter and insist Veerpalu is false positive.[8][9] 6 wins (6 Individual, 0 Sprint) He is married to Angela Veerpalu and they have five children: Andreas (b. 1994), Anette, Anders, Anlourdees and Andorres.
