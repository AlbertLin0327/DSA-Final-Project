Low ratings, due to a poor timeslot and lack of promotional or commercial advertisement, have unfortunately likely spelled the end to this show.

In Season 2, Roadrunner Records replaced Wind-Up Records to feature music in each episode performed by artists signed to their label. After winning the first season of Scream Queens, Tanedra appeared in Saw 6 and Saw 7. Season 2 winner, Gabby, also appeared in Saw 7. Christine, third place in Scream Queens 2, appeared on the Food Network's Cupcake Wars as a model of Carmen Miranda on the episode "Almas Awards".Sarah,a contestant on the first season appeared in the 2010 slasher film Hatchet II.
