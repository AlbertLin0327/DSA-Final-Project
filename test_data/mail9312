Steve 'Zetro' Souza is one of the two singers, with Chuck Billy, for the band Dublin Death Patrol.[1] He also sings for the death/thrash metal band Tenet, and recently announced his new thrash metal project Hatriot. Souza was the lead singer for the thrash metal bands Legacy (later known as Testament) and Exodus.[2] Zetro is best known for his time in Exodus, for whom he sang between 1986 and 1993 after being brought in to replace Paul Baloff. Before singing for Exodus, he was the lead singer for the band Legacy (which became Testament after his departure), recording one demo. At the time of his departure of Legacy, he introduced Chuck Billy to Legacy members and joined Exodus. Exodus was disbanded shortly after the release of Force of Habit. He later rejoined the reformed Exodus from 2001 to 2004. He again parted ways with the band during their South American tour later in 2004. He recently hosted the Thrash Against Cancer benefit in 2005 at The Pound in San Francisco, and appears onstage with Testament every time they play the Bay Area. His voice is reminiscent of AC/DC's former vocalist Bon Scott, and can be heard on the AC/DC covers that Exodus recorded during the 80's, "Overdose" (on 1988's Fabulous Disaster) and "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap". Souza's voice is also very similar to the one of Overkill vocalist Bobby "Blitz" Ellsworth. In 2006 he and Chuck Billy formed Dublin Death Patrol, an American thrash metal band. Alongside Willy Lange (Laaz Rockit). In 2007 they went on a world tour and did Fields of Rock in Holland alongside Heaven & Hell, Korn, Iron Maiden, Ozzy, Machine Head, Black Label Society, Hatebreed, Megadeth, Papa Roach, Slayer, Motrhead, Mastodon, Velvet Revolver, Dream Theater, Suicidal Tendencies, Amon Amarth, DragonForce, Ill Nio, and DevilDriver.

The album was eventually released in July 2009.
