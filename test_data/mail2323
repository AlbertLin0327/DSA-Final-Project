Royal Admiral was a 914 burthen ton merchant and convict ship that was dispatched in 1791 and 1800 from England to Australia. She was built in 1777 on the River Thames for Thomas Larkins. She was employed for the services of the East India Company on various occasions between 1777 and 1798.[1] Under the command of Essex Henry Bond, she sailed from Torbay, England, on 30 May 1791, with 299 male and 49 female convicts and arrived in Port Jackson, New South Wales on 7 October 1792. 10 male and 2 female convicts died during the voyage. One convict escapee from the Pitt was captured and transported onboard. On her second voyage under the command of William Wilson, she sailed from England, on 23 May 1800, with 300 male convicts and arrived in Port Jackson, New South Wales on 20 November 1800. Forty-three male convicts died during the voyage.
