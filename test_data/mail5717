Namosi is one of Fiji's fourteen Provinces, and one of eight based in Viti Levu, the largest island. Located to the west of Suva, the Province covers 570 square kilometers. Its population of 6,898 at the 2007 census was the smallest of any Fijian Province. Namosi Province includes Namosi District, as well as the Districts of Veivatuloa and Wainikoroiluva. The Province is governed by a Provincial Council, chaired by Ratu Kiniviliame Taukeinikoro.The Paramount Chieftain of Namosi is The Turaga Na Tui Namosi, Ratu Suliano Matanitobua. Namosi has two towns within its provincial boundaries, being the Town of Navua and Deuba Pacific Harbour. Namosi as province has explored the potential of generating its own Hydro-Electricity, of which France has offered to support this multi million dollar project now waiting approval from National authorities. Namosi also has potential to generate revenue by means of Copper mining but more in depth research into environmental impact and sustainability will need to take place. A major fault line runs through Viti Levu part of this fault line runs between the Navua and Waidina River, which were once a single river but now are two separate Rivers due to ancient seismo-tectonic events the Gorge that exists that separates these rivers today is referred to as the Namosi Gorge.
