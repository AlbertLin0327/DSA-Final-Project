yangsvatnet is a lake in the municipality of Agdenes in Sr-Trndelag county, Norway. The lake lies in the west central part of Agdenes, just east of the border with Snillfjord. The lake is about 6.5 kilometres (4.0mi) west of the villages of Lensvik and Selbekken and about 9 kilometres (5.6mi) west of Ingdalen.[1]
