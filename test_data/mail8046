State Route 14 marker State Highways in Washington Interstate US State Former PSH 1964 renumbering Former State Route 14, also called the Lewis and Clark Highway, is a state highway in Washington. It extends for approximately 180 miles (290km) from a junction with Interstate 5 in Vancouver in the west, to a junction with Interstate 82 and U.S. Route 395 in the east; just across the state line from Umatilla, Oregon, and south of Kennewick. State Route 14 originates in downtown Vancouver at a junction with Interstate 5 just north of the Interstate Bridge. It proceeds east as a freeway for approximately 18 miles (29km) until it reaches the city of Camas, at which point it becomes a two-lane road. It then continues east along the north bank of the Columbia River (through the Columbia River Gorge) for the remainder of its journey. Other than the stretch of freeway in Clark County, SR 14 is a two-lane highway which often runs along steep bluffs as high as 800 feet (240m) through the Columbia Gorge, where frequent high winds can be a driving hazard. At the town of Lyle the forest scenery gives way to arid grasslands in a remarkably rapid transition. The stretch of SR 14 between Vancouver and Maryhill was formerly designated as U.S. Route 830. The section east of Maryhill was formerly designated as State Route 12. In 1967, U.S. Route 12 was extended from Lewiston, Idaho, into Washington state along what had been State Route 14 from near Centralia to Naches. At that point, what had been State Route 12 was redesignated State Route 14. In 1968, U.S. Route 830 was dropped from the U.S. Highway System, and State Route 14 was extended west to Vancouver. Prior to the 1964 renumbering, current State Route 14 from Vancouver to Maryhill had been a part of Primary State Highway 8, and east of Maryhill was the Maryhill-Kennewick branch of PSH 8. Former State Route 14 from Centralia to Naches was part of Primary State Highway 5.
