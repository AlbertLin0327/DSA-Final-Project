Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport (IATA: BJC,ICAO: KBJC,FAA LID: BJC) is a public-use airport located near Broomfield, Colorado, United States. The airport is owned and operated by Jefferson County and is situated midway between Denver and Boulder on U.S. Highway 36. It is located nine miles (14 km) northwest of the central business district of Denver,[1] and is the closest airport to downtown Denver.[2] The airport covers 633 acres (256ha) and has three runways.[1] Formerly known as Jefferson County Airport or Jeffco Airport, the airport was renamed Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport on October 10, 2006 [2] although it is sometimes referred to as Rocky Mountain Regional Airport, e.g. 2007-2012 county planning documents. This airport is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 20112015, which categorized it as a reliever airport.[3] It is home to a large general aviation population including a fair amount of corporate traffic and several flight schools. The airport's proximity to the nearby Interlocken business district contributes to its business traveler clientele. It has a control tower on 118.6 (Local) and 121.7 (Ground) that is open from 0600 to 2200 local time. ATIS/AWOS broadcasts on 126.25. There are three runways - 11/29 Left and Right and 2/20. Two fixed base operators (FBOs) offer fuel and other services. Two restaurants, Runway Grill and Blue Sky Bistro, are on the field, along with a pilot's lounge in the Denver Air FBO and a passenger terminal lobby. The Hilltop Inn, a bed & breakfast, and its companion restaurant, Wildflowers ("Authentic U.K. Fare"), is located on the property. The USDA Forest Service maintains its Jefferson County Tanker Base at the airport. Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport covers an area of 1,700 acres (688 ha) at an elevation of 5,673 feet (1,729 m) above mean sea level. It has three asphalt paced runways: 11L/29R is 9,000 by 100 feet (2,743 x 30 m); 11R/29L is 7,002 by 75 feet (2,134 x 23 m); 2/20 is 3,600 by 75 feet (1,097 x 23 m).[1] For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2011, the airport had 123,384 aircraft operations, an average of 338 per day: 95% general aviation, 4% air taxi, and 1% military.
