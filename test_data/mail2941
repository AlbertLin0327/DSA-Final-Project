It was established in 1964 after the amalgamation of Ontario Agricultural College, the Macdonald Institute, and the Ontario Veterinary College, and has since grown to an institution of more than 21,000 students and academic staff. While it currently offers over 94 undergraduate degrees, 48 graduate programs, and 6 associate degrees in many different disciplines, it is the on-going history of achievement in its roots of biomedical science, agriculture and veterinary medicine and the modern focus on life sciences that define the university. The University of Guelph is consistently ranked as a top comprehensive university in Canada by Maclean's magazine, and given top marks for student satisfaction among medium-sized universities in Canada by The Globe and Mail. It has held these rankings with its reputation, innovative research-intensive programs, and lively campus life cited as particular strengths. Currently, the faculty at the University of Guelph hold 39 Canada Research Chair positions in the research areas of natural sciences, engineering, health sciences and social sciences.[5] Recent academic achievements include the first scientific validation of water on Mars, Alpha-Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) on board the Mars Exploration Rovers and the Barcode of Life project for species identification. University of Guelph is home to the birthplace of DNA barcoding by Dr. Paul D. N. Hebert for species identification.[6] The majority of students entering the University are enrolled in one of the 29 bachelor of science majors offered and enter with a 80% average or higher with the exception of students enrolled in the Biomedical science program which has a higher cut off.[7] The University of Guelph traces its origins back to when the Ontario government bought 500 acres (200ha) of farmland and opened the Ontario School of Agriculture on May 1, 1874, which was renamed the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC) in 1880.[8] Its first building was Moreton Lodge, located where Johnston Hall now stands, which included classrooms, residences, a library, and a dining room. The Macdonald Institute was established in 1903 to house women's home economics programs, nature studies, and some domestic art and science.[8][9] It was named after its financier, Sir William Macdonald, who worked to promote domestic sciences in rural Canada, and founded Macdonald College and McGill University College. The Ontario Veterinary College (OVC), originally founded in Toronto in 1862, was moved to Guelph in 1922.[10] These three adjacent colleges would be amalgamated into the single body of the University of Guelph by the Ontario Legislature on May 8, 1964. The University of Guelph Act also brought about the Board of Governors to oversee administrative operations and financial management, and the Senate to address academic concerns. The non-denominational graduate and undergraduate institution was, and remains known especially for the agricultural and veterinary programs that shaped it.[9] Wellington College was established shortly after the University of Guelph Act, and five years later, was split three ways into the College of Arts (COA), which exists in the present day, the College of Physical Science and the College of Social Science. The Macdonald Institute would also be renamed the College of Family and Consumer Studies during the split.[8] After this split, the University of Guelph started reorganizing into its present day form, starting from the establishment of the College of Biological Sciences (CBS) in 1971. The College of Physical Science would be married to the OAC's School of Engineering in 1989, creating the College of Physical and Engineering Sciences (CPES). The College of Social Science and the College of Family and Consumer Studies were joined to create the College of Social and Applied Human Sciences (CSAHS) in 1998. Finally, the College of Management and Economics (CME) would be established from the segregation of offered business, management and economic degrees and courses in 2006.[8] The main university campus spans 1,223 acres (495ha), including the 408 acres (165ha) University of Guelph Arboretum and a 30-acre (12ha) research park. The campus, which mixes old-fashioned brick buildings with mid-century Brutalism, as well as more contemporary stone structures, is generally regarded as scenic and architecturally diverse. It is well-populated with trees, including those which line the main walkways, many of which are paved with red brick. The campus includes an arboretum with an impressive collection of trees. Campus safety is provided by the University of Guelph Campus Police, First Response Team and Fire Prevention officers.[11][12][13] The Ontario Agricultural College has a network of campuses and research stations throughout Ontario, which were formerly operated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs.[10] Courses are offered in English in Guelph, Kemptville and Ridgetown, and in French at Campus dAlfred. Campus d'Alfred is located in the eastern Ontario, in the town of Alfred, Ontario close to Canadas capital city, Ottawa. This unique campus attracts students from across Canada and the world. It offers diploma and certificate programs which are all taught in French. The Kemptville Campus of Ontario Agriculture College is located in Kemptville, Ontario. It has been serving the residents of Eastern Ontario since 1917. The campus and research station is located on over 800 acres (320ha) and features 21st century facilities. The Ridgetown Campus is located on over 450 acres (180ha) in Ridgetown, Ontario this campus provides the advantages of a small town atmosphere with the opportunities of a larger center within a 30 minute drive. The University of Guelph-Humber is a university-college partnership between the University of Guelph and Humber College. It is located on Humber's North Campus in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The school offers eight regular four-year academic programs, each of which grant both a university honours degree and college diploma. The University of Guelph offers over 90 majors in 13 degree programs and 63 Open Learning/Distance Education Opportunities. The overall average for all students entering Guelph is 82%. Guelph students also have the highest graduation rate among Canadian comprehensive universities (at 89%), 5.8% higher than the national average. As well, University of Guelph has been stated to be the best comprehensive university of Canada by Macleans magazine in 2006 and 2007. The school is noted for receiving the most health related research funding than any other Canadian university without a medical school and for having one of the highest proportions of life science expertise per capita than any other university in North America. This has ultimately led to the current focus of the University in the areas of health,food,environment and community. The University of Guelph consists of seven faculties (or colleges, as they're known at Guelph): Other areas of academic specialization include the: The University of Guelph, along with University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University is a member of the Tri-University History group, which combines the history departments of the three universities at the graduate level. Graduate students are registered at one of the three universities according to their supervisor, but can take courses at any of the campuses. This allows the group to have more diverse course offerings more efficiently. The University of Guelph specializes in Scottish History, as well as local and rural history. Several buildings constructed during the establishment of the OAC still exist as part of the main campus today. These include the President's Residence, Raithby House, and Day Hall. From the turn of the century to the movement of the OVC, many more buildings were added to the campus: MacDonald Hall, Massey Hall, the Bullring, Mills Hall, and Food Science. The War Memorial Hall, established in 1924, is a landmark building on the campus of the University of Guelph designed by Harry Reginald Coales (architect) as a lecture hall or theatre to honour students who had enlisted and died in the First World War.[17] Two bronze tablets in the Memorial Chapel remembers the alumni who died in the First World War and in the Second World War.[18] Johnston Hall, a signature symbol of the university, was constructed in 1931, taking the place of the torn-down Moreton Lodge and becoming the home for the OAC Administration. The Johnston Clock tower overlooks Winegard Walk and is visible from much of the campus. The building also overlooks Johnston Green, a popular location for recreational sporting activities and outdoor concerts. Rozanski Hall is located in the heart of the University of Guelph campus. Equipped with state-of-the-art technology, including electronic white boards, laptop sound, picture and wireless internet and high luminance video/data projectors, Rozanski Hall accommodates over 1,500 students in several lecture halls.[19] The Science Complex opened for the 2007/2008 academic year. It is the largest integrated science teaching and research facility in North America. This facility houses 150 faculty and 4500 students, and centralizes physical, biological and computational sciences. The Pathobiology and Animal Health Laboratory was opened in 2010. Its goal is to strengthen Canada's ability to prevent diseases and solve health issues at the human/animal interface. Supporting the growing role of veterinarians in research and educational initiatives related to public health, this four-storey building includes a lecture theatre, seminar rooms, a teaching lab, and research and laboratory facilities. The Biodiversity Institute of Ontario is the worlds first centre for high-volume DNA barcoding  the rapid identification of millions of species. It is anticipated that faculty will enter over 500,000 barcode analyses per year. The University's School of Engineering is in the midst of an approximately $50 million expansion between 2009 and 2011 in the form of new construction and renovations. This is in response to recently introduced Mechanical, Biomedical and Computer Engineering programs, increased enrolment in existing undergraduate and graduate programs and expanding fields of research especially in areas related to sustainability. Alexander Hall is a cutting-edge environmental teaching and research centre. The Animal Cancer Center is Canada's first institute for comparative cancer investigation. It includes a linear accelerator offering the most advanced animal radiation treatment available. It is anticipated that discoveries in animal cancer will help study cancer treatment in humans as well. Originally built in the 1940s and expanded in the 1950s, the current W.F. Mitchell Athletic Centre is to be upgraded and expanded to keep up with university and community needs. 70% of Guelph students currently participate in athletics, recreation or fitness programming, and the demand continues to grow. The full build-out of the proposed plan includes a total of 800,000 square feet (74,000 m2), 11 fields, site improvements and parking; mostly to be implemented over the next 10 years. A large portion of students reside on campus in co-ed residences. Those that do typically live in the East Residence (610 residents), East Townhouses (645), Johnston Hall (315), Lambton Hall (400), Lennox/Addington Hall (520), Macdonald Hall (150, female only), Maids Hall (50, also known as Artz Has), Mills Hall (160), Watson Hall (67, also known as International House), West Residences (110 students living amongst the Family Housing community), and South Residence (1700 residents evenly distributed across Mountain, Prairie and Maritime Halls). The LLC (Living Learning Centre) community is made up of Maids and Watson Halls, as well as two sections of the Dundas area in East known as Eco House and French House sometimes linked together as Freco. The program is conducted such that students who are interested in extracurricular development of their interests peripheral to academic achievement can cohabitate among others with the same goal. Each individual community has Residence Life Staff personnel assigned to facilitate programming and community development centred on their respective focuses. Also on campus are the East Village Townhouses that were opened during the fall of 2001. The townhouses consist of 164 four-, five- and six-bedroom self-contained units. These primarily house upper-year students and international students. West Residences, consisting of the 78 College Avenue and 252 Stone Road (also referred to as Wellington Woods) locations, is home to 110 upper-year students. These students live amongst the Family Housing residents in either two bedroom townhouses, or one to two bedroom apartments (only available at the College Avenue location). West Residences promote diverse programs and includes many opportunities for community involvement. South Residence, the largest residence on campus, is home to 1700 students, as well as over 50 Residence Life Staff members.[3]. South Residence is split into three self-contained Halls with independent fire alarm grids. It was built in 1965 by Australian architect John Andrews, a brutalist architect who has designed several Canadian university residences, as well as Toronto's iconic CN Tower.[20] The persistent rumour that the residence was designed by the same architect as the Kingston Penitentiary is false. This would be all but impossible, as the iconic Canadian prison was constructed over a century before South Residence. With 14 different campus living environments, U of G has one of the largest university housing systems in Canada. The University is planning to construct a new student residence on campus with assistance from a private-sector builder that would provide the capital for the new building. The six-storey McLaughlin Library provides students with more than 400 computers in the library and access to books, periodicals, films, audiovisual and archival materials, government documents and maps. The library provides support for everyone's research needs, from undergraduate essays to specialized graduate-level investigations. The library has more than 1 million visitors annually. The Library has student-centred services from building hours, computer access, individual and group study space, and a main floor lounge serving food and refreshments. The Learning Commons also offers resources and services to help users with research, technology, writing, and learning with locations on the main floor of McLaughlin Library, the Ontario Veterinary College (OVC) Learning Commons and Guelph-Humber Learning Commons. The Tri-University Group of Libraries (TRELLIS) is part of a partnership involving the libraries of the Universities of Guelph, Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier. Students have access to library resources totaling 7.5 million items through the automated library system. Guelph students, faculty and staff also have access to electronic resources from any location at any time. The Library is a leader in offering electronic resources, including nearly 10,000 e-journals as well as databases, reference resources, and live online help. The University of Guelph ranks 14th among the top 50 research Universities in Canada, the highest spot for a Canadian University without a medical school.[25] In the Canadian University Report by the Globe and Mail, Guelph was ranked in the top 3rd in 15 of 19 categories among medium-sized universities. This included the top spot in course registration, academic counselling, student residences, information technology, campus atmosphere, environmental commitment and work-play balance.[26] The University of Guelph is currently ranked by Maclean's magazine as the fourth best comprehensive university in Canada ("comprehensive" indicating institutions with significant research activity and a range of programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels, including professional degrees). The University of Guelph has ranked as a top 3 of comprehensive universities in Canada ranking #1 in 1999, 2002, 2003, and 2006. Supports current research and inovation for instruments used in space, primarily the APXS found on the Mars rovers and Mars Science laboratory. Other inititatives include development of air filters for manned spacecrafts and research on changes in skin sensitivity and balance experienced by astronauts in space. The University holds a partnership with Research In Motion (RIM). Ground is being broken through the Center for Mobile Education and Research, the Chair for Women in Science and Engineering and the financial and educational support RIM extends to the University of Guelph.[27] The Center for Mobile Education and Research (CMER) is housed within the Department of Computing and Information Science at the University of Guelph. The mission of CMER is to engage in leading edge applied research to develop state-of-the-art applications and services to facilitate and enhance mobile education and learning, and to provide leadership in integrating mobile devices into the computer science curriculum.[28] A collaborative effort between the University of Waterloo, Guelph, Wilfird Laurier and Conestoga College, The Partnerships for Employment Career Fair is the largest in the country.[29] The agreement between the University of Guelph and the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, attracts a critical mass of research expertise to the University and the city.[30] Student government on campus is governed officially through the university's Student Organization Policy or "SOP". This document, created initially in 2005 provides the basis for accrediting student groups on campus. The Student Groups listed as Primary Student Organizations under the policy are: Each of the above PSOs accredit and thus are held accountable for many of the various clubs and student groups on campus. By and large the CSA accredits the most student groups with approximately 70 accredited today. Generally CSA-accredited groups are special interest groups like CHAT (a multi-lingual group), the Jewish Students' Organization (JSO), the Muslim Students' Association and more, catering to those who wish to begin new interest-specific clubs on campus. The College Governments (CA-SU, CBS-SC, CME-SA, CPES-SC, CSAHS-SA, SF-OAC and the CVSA) accredit academically focused groups while IHC accredits 14 groups (includes the temporary residence Brock House for the 2011/2012 year) as hall councils, one for each residence hall on campus. The University also has a department called Student Life which offers a comprehensive package of programs and services that help students make a successful transition to, through and from university life and study. The curricular and co-curricular initiatives, advising and support activities are set out to serve as vehicles through which students can explore their leadership capacity, make long lasting connections, and optimize opportunities to learn through experiences. As well as develop a sense of civic/community responsibility, and be engaged in the campus and community life of the University. Across campus, members of the Residence Student Government, known as Interhall Council, contribute to the programming in each hall. This group of 62 elected members works with students within their halls and are also responsible for facilitating a hall council for hall members to attend. During the 2011/2012 year, a council was stricken at the West Residence Family Housing units and the temporary Brock House residence, bringing the total number of councils to 14. Interhall Council also acts as a liaison between students and Student Housing Services, University Administration, and other on-campus organizations. The governance of the University of Guelph is a bicameral system consisting of: At its first convocation on May 21, 1965 George Drew was installed as chancellor of the University.[31] The university is represented in the Ontario University Athletics and the Canadian Interuniversity Sport by the Guelph Gryphons. The school colors are red, black and yellow or gold. The UG's mascot is a Gryphon named Gryph. The University offers 15 varsity sports for men and 15 for women. OUA only sports include baseball (men), figure skating (women), golf, Nordic skiing, rowing, and rugby union (men). Currently 7 out of every 10 Guelph students participate in athletics, recreation or fitness programming. Nationally, the OUA is one of the CIS conferences, along with Atlantic University Sport, Canada West Universities Athletic Association, and the Quebec Student Sports Federation. CIS sports which UG participates in include basketball, cross country running, field hockey (women), Canadian football (men), ice hockey, rugby union (women), soccer, swimming, track & field, volleyball and wrestling. The Gryphon's men's football team won its only national championship in 1984. In 2008 the Gryphon's Men's Lacrosse team won the Baggataway Cup at the Canadian national field lacrosse champions with a 14-9 win over McGill University at Ron Joyce Stadium in Hamilton. The Gryphons are particularly well-known for their exploits in athletics, having won the men's and women's cross-country titles consecutively six (2006-present) and seven (2007-present) times respectively [34]. In addition to this, the Gryphons won the men's track & field title in 2010, and both the men's and women's titles in 2008, and are seeking a resurgence in the year 2013[35]. Old Jeremiah is the name of an antique British naval gun that currently rests along Winegard Walk in Branion Plaza, at the heart of the University of Guelph campus. Rumoured to have seen battle during the War of 1812, Old Jeremiah was last fired in April 1913. After World War I, the gun's barrel was plugged and it was brought to campus by students as a sign of remembrance for those lost in battle. It is often referred to simply and affectionately as The Cannon. During the 1970s, Old Jeremiah was briefly relocated to Johnston Green and renamed The Big Johnston. As a result of jovial rivalry between Engineering and Agricultural Science students ("Aggies"), the cannon has enjoyed plenty of movement around the Guelph campus in the past as a result of practical jokes between the two majors. Although it is nearly impossible to nail down the exact previous locations of the cannon, it is rumoured to have traveled all over campus, at one point even perching on top of MacNaughton (a prominent university building containing the Bookstore), and at another even disappearing altogether and showing up a day later on the University of Waterloo campus. Eventually, fed up with the movement of Old Jeremiah, university officials cemented the cannon in place where it sits today. However, as a final stab at humour, a group of students shifted the still-mobile direction of the cannon's face, and aimed it at the fourth floor of the University Center, home of the institution's senior administration. Old Jeremiah rests in this position today. Despite its movement, the cannon enjoyed relative tranquility until the 1950s when an aspiring entrepreneurial student came up with the idea of painting a message on the highly visible landmark. The act of "painting the cannon" has since become a campus tradition with students, residences, sports teams, clubs and others braving the early morning hours to paint messages on the cannon, most often about upcoming events but also including birthday announcements, wedding proposals and public insults. The etiquette governing "painting the cannon" is unofficial but well-understood: 1) do not begin painting the cannon until the sun has set, 2) be finished by the time the first students arrive for classes in the morning, and 3) avoid profanity or coarse language. It is well-accepted practice to "guard" the cannon until sunrise so as to avoid another person or group painting over one's message. In the fall of 2010, Master of Fine Arts student and art teacher Dawn Johnston began to strip Old Jeremiah of all the layers of paint it had accumulated since the 1950s as an art project. Calling it "[her] form of sculpture," Johnston completed the project over a week's time within a wooden enclosure to avoid the watchful eyes of passing students. Some students were upset about the removal, claiming that Johnston was "taking away [their] history," although the project was done with the approval of university faculty. Upon completion, the enclosure was removed and the bare cannon was revealed, however the tradition of painting Old Jeremiah has since resumed.[36] This successful cornerstone of the University of Guelphs Orientation program takes place each year at the beginning of Orientation Week. All new students within each residence are taught a dance - often referred to as the Hall Boogie - which is performed to a variety of mixed popular songs. Awards are presented to the Halls which demonstrate the best spirit, creativity, synchronisation and co-ordination. Many of the dances are very impressive, despite being practiced in typically an hour or less. A University of Guelph trademark dance move, Winding Your Toy, is almost always incorporated into each boogie, usually to a bass-heavy dance track. A winding motion is made with the rear hand - as if winding a wind-up toy - while the knees are bent in rhythm. The origins of "winding the toy" are not well known, yet it retains notoriety among students and friends of students at the university. The Rally is the kick-off to the remainder of Orientation activities. The University of Guelph must apply for a special noise permit for the event as the activity can often be heard for miles. In 2004, "Student Power" was introduced as a low-key alternative event to the Pep Rally for anyone who may not be as inclined to participate in the highly energetic and boisterous Pep Rally. An annual feature of the university is its open house, known as College Royal. For a weekend each March, every part of the campus and its programs is exhibited to the public, from the barns of the Agricultural College to the sugar bush in the arboretum. It is highly popular with visitors of all ages, especially families with children who take advantage of the March break (the usual Ontario school break) to have an outing. The 2006 College Royal was visited by Rick Mercer, taping a segment for his show, the Rick Mercer Report. The Cannon[38] is an online website co-founded by The Guelph Campus Co-operative and the CSA created for, and funded by, undergraduate students. Although it has a paid editor, all students are encouraged to submit news articles, announcements for upcoming events, opinion pieces, digital photographs and other content that Guelph students may find interesting or useful. Founded in September 2002, the site has features such as Rate-a-Prof, where students share insight and opinions regarding professors, and a free classifieds section, available as a means of buying and selling used textbooks and course materials. The name of the site is a reference to Old Jeremiah, as the website parallels the use of the cannon as a campus-wide message board.
