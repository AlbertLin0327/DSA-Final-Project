William Bedford (born December 14, 1963 in Memphis, Tennessee) is a retired American professional basketball player who was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the 1st round (6th overall) of the 1986 NBA Draft after playing at Memphis State University (now known as the University of Memphis). Bedford, a 7'0" center, played for the Suns, Detroit Pistons and the San Antonio Spurs in 6 NBA seasons averaging 4.1 points and 2.4 rebounds per game in his career. Originally projected as a star player, Bedford's NBA career was a disappointment as he succumbed to drug use, never reaching his full potential.[1] Bedford has had drug problems ever since he left the NBA. He was arrested for drug possession twice between 1996 and 1997. In 2001, Bedford was accused of transporting 25 pounds of marijuana in Michigan.[2] After the Michigan arrest, he was arrested two more times for marijuana, and in 2003 was given a 10-year prison sentence.[3] As of 2008, Bedford is serving time in a Fort Worth, Texas prison on drug-related charges, and is scheduled for release in 2013.[4][5]
