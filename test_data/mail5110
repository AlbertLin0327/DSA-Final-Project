Estonias entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 was selected by an international jury. They decided that Sandra Oxenryd would represent Estonia at Eurovision 2006 with the song Through My Window, which contained up-tempo country-soul music. The song is written by Pearu Paulus, Ilmar Laisaar, Alar Kotkas (composers) and Jana Hallas (lyricist), the same authors who wrote the Estonian entries for 2000 ("Once in a lifetime") and 2002 ("Runaway"), which came 4th and 3rd, respectively. Sandra Oxenryd is from Kristinehamn, Sweden and was the winner of the Swedish Fame Factory. She had great success with her album, "All There Is." Sandra is not the first Swede to represent Estonia, as Anna Sahlene represented Estonia in 2002 with Runaway. For the delight of the Estonian audience, however, Sandra Oxenryd had two well-known Estonian backing singers on stage with her in Athens, Dagmar Oja and Jelena Juzvik. The rest were from Sweden, like Sandra herself. Despite receiving good receptions in dress rehearsal, Sandra finished 18th of 23 entrants in the Semi-Final, well away from the Top 10 finish that would have seen her qualify.
