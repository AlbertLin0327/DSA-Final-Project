Corny Point is a settlement in South Australia[4] at the north-western tip of the "boot" of Yorke Peninsula. It was named this by Matthew Flinders in March 1802 because it appeared to be a growth on the toe of Yorke Peninsula.[5] A lighthouse was built in 1882. The first pastoral lease was taken up in 1846.[6] The site is notable for outcrops of Palaeoproterozoic gneisses[7] of the Lincoln Complex on the wave cut platform at the base of the low limestone cliffs.[citation needed] Yorke Peninsula
