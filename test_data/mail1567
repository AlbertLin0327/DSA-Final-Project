In total there are 317[1] listed buildings in the city of Southampton, of which 14 are Grade I, 20 are Grade II* and the remainder Grade II. In England, a building or structure is defined as "listed" when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of "special architectural or historic interest" by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, a Government department, in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.[2] English Heritage, a non-departmental public body, acts as an agency of this department to administer the process and advise the department on relevant issues.[3] There are three grades of listing status. The Grade II designation is the lowest, and is used for "nationally important buildings of special interest".[4] Grade II* is used for "particularly important buildings of more than special interest", while Grade I (defined as being of "exceptional interest" and greater than national importance), is the highest of the three grades.[4] This list summarises 35 Grade II-listed buildings and structures whose names begin with M to O. Numbered buildings with no individual name are listed by the name of the street on which they stand. Map of first 200 coordinates from Bing
