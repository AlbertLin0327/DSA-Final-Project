Subject: List of mountains of the British Isles by relative height 
To: Amber
Content:
This is a list of peaks in the British Isles, with a relative height of 600m or more, in descending order of relative height. There are 119 in total: 82 in Scotland, 24 in Ireland, seven in Wales, four in England and one each in Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. Of these, the top 110 are above 2000feet (610m). For a longer list, see the lists of Marilyns which include all 2008 hills and mountains in the British Isles with a relative height of at least 150m. The relative height is the minimum height of climb to the summit on any route from a higher peak, or from sea level if there is no higher peak on the same landmass. The higher peak is known as a 'parent'. In this table, the prominence parent is used, as opposed to any other definition of 'parent'. The prominence parent of peak A can be found by dividing the island or region in question into territories, by tracing the runoff from the key col of every peak that is more prominent than peak A. The parent is the peak whose territory peak A resides in. Most of these peaks make it into this list by virtue of the fact that they are the highest point in their local areas. To help readers identify the locations of the peaks, the topographic area of which these peaks are the highest point is listed in the 'Highest point of...' column. ^1 Rois-Bheinn and Beinn Odhar Bheag both have a height of 882m and are separated by a 524m drop. They are collectively separated from Gaor Bheinn (their parent) by a 774m drop making one of them eligible for inclusion in this list. However, without more accurate heights, it is impossible to say which should be included making them an example of a twin peak. ^2 Ben Loyal was at one time shown as having a height of 765m and drop of 610m. The current OS 1:25000 map gives 765m in brackets, presumably an air height. The height of the flush bracket on the trig is 764.1m so even 764m is a rounded-up height. The col is a 155m air height. From site visits there appears to be no evidence for any ground 1m higher than the trig.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
