Hugh Thomas was an Australian rules football coach who coached St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Thomas served initially as an assistant coach to Jock McHale at Collingwood, in what was a successful era for the club. He became St Kilda's senior coach in 1944 and steered them to ninth position, with six wins and two draws during the year. After they struggled in 1945, Thomas was replaced by Allan Hird. In 1950, he coached VFA club Preston for the year. His brother Artie was a rover at St Kilda from 1910 to 1913.
