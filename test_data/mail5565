Andrew Crayford is a British singer-songwriter leader of rock band The Kosmos. Andrew Crayford was born in Islington, London, England. He formed his first band Summer Buzz as vocalist rhythm guitar with best friends Ken Yeomans, Michael Fraser and Kurt Ferdinand. The band played a handful of gigs before Crayford and Yeomans left to become a songwriting and production team until 2003, before deciding to pursue solo projects. In 2007 Crayford formed band The Kosmos, of which he is lead singer, lyricist and guitarist. Shortly after the debut album Unplugged,[1] released through digital distribution, the band's 1960s influenced powerpop indie sound was recognised by US based label Harvest Music in 2008, featuring the song So In Love on the cd compilation Dig Music Vol. 1.[2] In 2010, Harvest Music invited Crayford to their roster of artistes. In the same year, the promo video for So In Love, directed by Alberto Bona, was featured at the Portobello Film Festival. Andrew Crayford and The Kosmos have toured extensively around the United Kingdom. They performed live at 93 Feet East, where bands such as Radiohead have also performed.
