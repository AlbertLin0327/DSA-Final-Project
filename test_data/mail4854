A hydrational fluid is a liquid substance that supplies the body with water. Without these fluids our bodies would die. Most drinks contain water. Hydrational fluids have been in use since neolithic times. The term was not created until 2011, when Alma, A US nursing student discovered its uses for hydration. On behalf of the internet, and the world, Alma, we thank you.
