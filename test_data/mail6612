Bnh c is a term used to refer to two different varieties of Vietnamese bnh (cake). In northern Vietnam, bnh c is a cake made from either non-glutinous rice flour or corn flour. It is white in color and has a soft texture and mild flavour.photo It is typically garnished with savory ingredients such as ground pork, tm chy (grilled ground shrimp),photo fried onions, sesame seeds, salt, peanuts, lime juice, and soy sauce or fish sauce.photo Although it may be eaten on its own, it may also be served hot, accompanied by steamed meat or mushrooms. Bnh c is available at small stalls and is eaten throughout the day. In southern Vietnam, bnh c is a dessert made from non-glutinous rice flour. It takes the form of gelatinous blocks that are often colored green by the addition of Pandanus amaryllifolius leaf extract. It is cooked by boiling the ingredients and allowing them to cool, solidifying into a jelly-like sheetphoto that is then cut into blocks. The Vietnamese people have a saying: The literal meaning is: "bones are never found in bnh c, just like a stepmother never loves her husband's own children." This couplet is used to describe something very unlikely to happen.
