Civil and Civic (also 'Civil and Civic Contractors' and 'Civil and Civic Pty Ltd') was an Australian company acquired in 1961 by Lend Lease Corporation. The Company was originally founded by Dick Dusseldorp in 1951 on behalf of the Dutch building companies Bredero's Bouwbedrijf of Utrecht and The Royal Dutch Harbour Company as an Australian-based building contractor.[1] Its first contract was to supply and erect 200 prefabricated houses for the Snowy Mountains Authority which had been established by William Hudson, engineer of the Snowy Mountains Scheme.

Civil and Civic went on to become Australia's leading provider of project management services in the construction industry, delivering a number of landmark projects including Stage I of the Sydney Opera House,[2] Australia's first high-rise (Caltex House),[2] and the world's first high-rise strata title apartment building (Blues Point Tower).[3] In 1961 Civil and Civic was acquired by Lend Lease Corporation, but the company continued to trade under the Civil and Civic name for some time, also constructing the world's tallest lightweight concrete construction building (Australia Square),[2] and the tallest building in the world outside North America (MLC Centre) at the time of completion.[2] In 1999 Lend Lease Corporation acquired P&O's Global Project Management Company, Bovis, rebranding the business as Bovis Lend Lease.
