The Holy fathers slain at Sinai and Raithu are saints venerated together on January 14 by the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches. They comprise two different groups of saints who were killed at different times and at different locations. Their names are given as Isaiah, Sabbas, Moses, Jeremiah, Paul, Adam, Sergius, Domnus, Proclus, Hypatius, Isaac, Macarius, Mark, Benjamin, Eusebius, and Elias. A group of these martyrs were killed at Sinai during the reign of Diocletian, about the year 296. The martyrs of Raithu were killed about the middle of the fifth century. The killing of both groups of martyrs is attributed to the tribe called the Blemmyes, from parts of Arabia.
