Daniel Ross Moskos (born April 28, 1986) is an American baseball pitcher in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization. A left-handed pitcher,[1] Moskos was drafted with the 4th overall pick in the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates.[2] Daniel Moskos was born on April 28, 1986 and attended Damien High School in La Verne, California along with Minnesota Vikings running back Ian Johnson, Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Freddie Brown, and Chivas USA forward Chukwudi Chijindu . He has a fastball that sits at about 94mph (90mph was MLB average is 2007), and has been clocked as high as 96. His slider during this time was clocked at 83. Moskos has a big arm with above-average velocity. He has the ability to throw, potentially, three pitches (the fastball, slider and changeup), which is a plus as well. Moskos was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates with the 4th overall pick of the 2007 MLB draft and signed with the Pirates. After placing pitcher Evan Meek on the 15-day DL with right shoulder tendinitis, the Pirates called Moskos up to the majors for the first time on April 30, 2011. On that same night, he made his Major League debut. On May 22 he was optioned back to their Triple A team, the Indianapolis Indians. Less than a week later on May 28, Moskos was recalled to Pittsburgh due to Joe Beimel going on the 15-day DL with shoulder tightness.
