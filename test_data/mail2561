Originally opened as the College of Catering in 1941, The Faculty of Tourism and Food was founded in 1992, and the Head of Faculty was Michael Mulvey, PhD. In a restructuring of The Faculty in 2009, the School of Hospitality Management and Tourism AND the School of Culinary Arts were merged with the former Faculty of Applied Arts into the new College of Arts and Tourism. The School of Food Science and Environmental Health was transferred to the new College of Science. The Faculty specialises in training professional chefs, hospitality managers, and other professionals in the food and tourism industry, providing undergraduate degrees as well as masters degrees and doctorates. It is considered the best college for food and tourism degrees in Ireland. Its graduates include Darina Allen, TV chef, food writer, and founder of the Michelin starred Ballymaloe House and Cookery School and food company, along with several other noted Irish chefs and hoteliers. The School of Culinary Arts and Food Technology is a school part of the Faculty of Tourism and Food of the Dublin Institute of Technology. The Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT)is a state funded, non-profit comprehensive higher educational Institution providing full-time and part-time programmes in the performing arts, science, technology and business at undergraduate and postgraduate level to 21,000 students in Ireland. The Institute is located on a number of sites around Dublin city. The school, based at the Cathal Brugha Street campus in Dublin City centre is the largest Irish provider of education, training and research for the broad culinary, food, beverage and hospitality industries and provides graduates with enhanced career opportunities (nationally & internationally) in restaurants, food processing, food retailing, teaching and education, food writing for the media and a number have opened their own businesses in food and beverage related activities. The school provides a range of innovative programmes (usually first in their field) from higher certificate, degree, masters degree and postgraduate research degrees. Areas of study include the culinary arts, bakery and bar management, food product development, gastronomy, health, hygiene & safety and wine studies. Modules from the full-time programmes are available on a part-time continuing professional development (CPD) basis. Successful completion of a module qualifies the student for a certificate and consideration for exemption from the equivalent subject on the relevant Degree Programme. In this manner over a period of time a part-time student can in addition to obtaining valuable qualifications and certification build towards a degree. Students are encouraged to develop not only their social and technical skills but also to embrace innovation and creativity in particular through entering prestigious culinary and beverage competitions both nationally and internationally at which they have enjoyed great success. The school offers short, specifically tailored courses designed to meet the needs of industry and has an active research and development service through its close ties to the DIT Food Product Development Centre. Industry has been very supportive of the school and many of the leading organizations active in the hospitality, food and wine industry have acted as mentors to student on industry placements, served on advisory panels to help develop new programmes and donate scholarships and bursaries to encourage high performing students. This level of support from industry and the continued success of students and graduates is reassuring and indicates that the partnership between the school, students, graduates and industry is vibrant and dynamic and will continue to grow into the future to the mutual benefit of all.
