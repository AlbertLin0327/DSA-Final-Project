The 1991 UK Championship professional ranking snooker tournament took place at the Guildhall, Preston. The highest break of the televised stages was 142 made by Martin Clark and the same for the non-televised stages was 137 made by Mark Bennett. John Parrott won his first and only UK Championship, beating Jimmy White 1613, in the final. He had won the World Championship in the same year, so winning the UK Championship completed a rare double that very few players have achieved.
