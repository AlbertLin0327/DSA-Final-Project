Erald 'Tushe' Turdiu (born July 15, 1984 in Tirana) is an Albanian football player currently playing for Kastrioti Kruj in the Albanian Superliga for the third time in his career. He has previously played for KF Tirana and Shkumbini Peqin. Turdiu was assaulted by police in 2008 whilst he was a Shkumbini Peqin player, following a brawl in which he was witness to. It is claimed that Turdiu had insulted the on-duty police officer and they reacted violently, beating Turdiu in the centre of the capital, Tirana.[1] In December 2010, Turdiu brutally assaulted Albanian Superliga referee Laver Alla, outside a bar near Tirana International Airport. He faced a lifetime ban by the FSHF as the player had a string of offences and bans, including an 8 match ban following a mass brawl during the Albanian Superliga 2010 Playoff finals.[2] He received a 4 year ban by the FSHF but following an appeal by the player and his club Kastrioti Kruj, the ban was lifted after just 8 months meaning Turdiu was eligible to play at the start of the 2011-12 campaign.[3]
