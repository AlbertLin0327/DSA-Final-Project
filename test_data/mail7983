Benito Jurez International Airport (Spanish: Aeropuerto Internacional de la Ciudad de Mxico Benito Jurez or AICM), (IATA: MEX,ICAO: MMMX) in Venustiano Carranza, one of the sixteen boroughs into which Mexico's Federal District is divided, is a commercial airport that serves Mexico City, the capital of Mexico. It is Mexico's busiest airport by both passenger traffic and aircraft movements and is the Latin America's second busiest airport by passenger traffic after Guarulhos Airport in So Paulo, Brazil and the busiest airport by aircraft movements. Although Jurez was not its official name for several decades, it was formally named after the 19th century president Benito Jurez in 2006, and is Mexico's main international and domestic gateway. The airport is owned by Grupo Aeroportuario de la Ciudad de Mxico and operated by Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares, the government-owned corporation, who also operates 21 others airports through Mexico. In recent years Toluca Airport has become an alternate airport. This hot and high airport is served by 30 domestic and international airlines and offers direct flights to more than 100 destinations worldwide.It provides non-stop services from Mexico City to North America, Central America and Caribbean, South America, Europe and Asia (Aeromexico is the only airline that flies to Asia from Mexico City). In 2011, the airport served 26,368,861 passengers a 9.28% increase compared to 2010. For the 12-month period ending April 30, 2012, the airport handled 27,842,489 passengers. In optimal conditions, and with the recent renovations and expansion projects completed, the Benito Jurez airport will be able to handle up to 32 million passengers per year.[3] As the main hub for Mexico's largest airline Aeromxico and a secondary hub for its subsidiary Aeromxico Connect, the airport has become a SkyTeam hub. It is also a hub for Aeromar, Interjet and a focus city for VivaAerobus and Volaris. The airport is 5km. east from central Mexico City and is surrounded by the built-up areas of Gustavo A. Madero to the north and Venustiano Carranza to the west, south and east. As the airport is east Mexico City and its runways run southwest-northeast, and airliner's landing approach is usually directly over Mexico City. Therefore, there is an important overflying problem. The airport first opened as Balbuena Military Airport with five runways. The first landing was on November 5, 1928 and regular service started a year later, but was officially inaugurated on May 15, 1931. Its first international route was to Los Angeles International Airport operated by Mexicana. President Miguel Alemn opened the terminal in 1952, thus becoming a commercial airport. In the 1970s, president Luis Echeverra closed three runways and gave that land to poor people in order to build their homes, leaving just two parallel runways. In 1980, the terminal was expanded to double its capacity, using a single large terminal rather than multiple terminals as in other airports. Ten years later in 1990, the mixed domestic/international gates were separated to increase the terminal's functionality, along with the separation of domestic and international check-in halls. In 2001, the east wing of the terminal (H-gates) was opened as a final call waiting area, mainly used by SkyTeam members. Because of the increasing traffic, president Vicente Fox announced the construction of a new, larger airport on 5,000 hectares (12,000 acres) in the municipalities of Texcoco and San Salvador Atenco, but when local violent protests aroused, the new airport was cancelled. Instead, he launched a program called Expansion of Mexico City Airport to its Maximum Capacity in 2002 to increase the airport's capacity. The whole terminal was expanded and upgraded with new check-in halls, 13 more baggage claim belts, the construction of Departures and Arrivals floors, construction of several new taxiways and a whole new terminal opposite of the original, thus breaking the single terminal concept. The project was started with an initial investment of $200,000,000 MXP. Nevertheless, its final cost was $800,000,000 MXP. The original quasi-Terminal 2, which only housed Aeromar's operations in and out the airport was demolished, and the new Terminal 2 was built in less than two years. On November 15, 2007, Terminal 2 was opened, increasing the airport's capacity. All SkyTeam members moved their operations to the new terminal, except Air France and KLM. It was officially inaugurated on March 2008, once the new road accesses and taxiways were finished. Terminal 2 increased the airport's contact positions by 40%, and the operational capacity by 15%. The airport has suffered from a lack of capacity due to restrictions for expansion, since it is located in a densely-populated area. Some analysts have reported that if the airport had grown at the same speed as demand, it would now serve over 40 million passengers annually. The main issue with the airport is the limitation that its two runways provide, since they are used at 97.3% of their maximum capacity, leaving a very short room for new operations into the airport. Only government, military, commercial and specially authorized aircraft are allowed to land at the airport. Private aircraft must use alternate airports, such as Lic. Adolfo Lopez Mateos International Airport in Toluca, General Mariano Matamoros Airport in Cuernavaca or Hermanos Serdn International Airport in Puebla. Even with the inauguration of the new Terminal 2, the airport would be ideally designed to serve around 18 million passengers per year, according to the international standards for runway and terminal usage. Instead, the airport will keep increasing the number of passengers from around 26 million passengers in 2008 at a rate of 16% per year. The Mexican Government laid the groundwork for a new airport to be built on the outskirts of Mexico City. After decades of planning a $2.3 billion dollar airport, peasant farmers who owned the property where the airport was proposed, took several hostages into their hands, refusing to give up their land at any cost. Mexico City International Airport has two passenger terminals. Terminal 1 is separated from the other by the runways. Terminal 1 is currently the largest airport terminal in the Americas and the fourth largest in the world. Terminal 2 is now housing all Aeromxico flights out of the airport, becoming the airline's main distribution center. Although the terminal was intended to be served by all-SkyTeam member airlines, Air France and KLM decided to remain at Terminal 1. The airport houses a wide variety of lodging options for its passengers, including hotels inside Terminal 1 (the Hilton Hotel, the Camino Real and the Fiesta Inn), as well as a NH Hotel at Terminal 2. Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares, a government-owned corporation that operates airports in Mexico, has its headquarters on the airport property.[4] The Aeromar headquarters are located in Hangar 7 in Zone D of the General Aviation Terminal of the airport.[5][6] Aviacsa has its headquarters in Hangar 1 in Zone C.[7] Other services. In addition to the scheduled airlines above, Mexico City airport is used by some further airlines for chartered flights including: As of May 2012, Mexico City airport is served by 17 cargo airlines flying directly to Europe, Central, North and South America. Over 411,000 metric tonnes pass through the airport in 2011, making it the third busiest by cargo traffic in Latin America, after El Dorado International Airport in Bogot and Guarulhos International Airport in So Paulo. Most passenger airlines, such as AeroMxico and KLM use the airport to carry hold cargo on passenger flights, though most cargo is transported by all-cargo airlines. The following airlines operate the following scheduled destinations. Airlines providing on-demand cargo services  In 2011, Benito Jurez was the busiest airport in Latin America by aircraft movements with 15% more operations than El Dorado International Airport in Bogot and 29.4% more than Guarulhos Airport in So Paulo. For the 12-month period ending April 30, 2012, the airport had 360,878 aircraft operations, an average of 989 operations per day.  Terminal 2 is connected to Terminal 1 by the Aerotrn monorail system in which only connecting passengers with hand baggage are allowed to use with their boarding pass. Technical and cabin crew can also use it. Normal operation hours are from 5:00 am to 11:00 pm, every day of the year, and the first run always begins from T2 to T1; the last run of the day is to T2. The distance between the terminals is 3km. and the Airtrain's speed is 45km. per hour. The Airtrain journey, once the doors are fully closed therefore takes approximately 4 minutes and 40 seconds between stations in both directions. Also, if you arrive as a train is leaving the maximum waiting period for the next train is 11 minutes. Also there is a land service between terminals called "inter-terminal transportation". These buses are located at entrance no. 6 of Terminal 1 and entrance no. 4 of Terminal 2. The airport is served by the Terminal Area Metro station, which belongs to Line 5 of the subway, running from Metro pantitlan.png Pantitln station to Metro politecnico.png Politcnico station. It is located just outside the T1's national terminal.Terminals 1 and 2 have two land terminals operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Different bus lines operate from here [1], and provide continuous transportation services to the main cities located around Mexico City, such as Crdoba, Cuernavaca, Pachuca, Puebla, Quertaro, Tlaxcala and Toluca. The Terminal 1 land terminal is located in front of the international area vehicular ramp and its facilities include various services for the comfort of the passengers. Among others, it offers VIP lounges, internet, resting, reading and meeting halls. The Terminal 2 land terminal is located at gate D, between entrance 4 and the national arrival passenger exit, and its facilities include resting halls and a fast food area. In late 2010, Head of Government of the Federal District Marcelo Ebrard announced a plan to build a new Metrobs Line 4 that would run from near Buenavista Station in the west of the city towards Mexico City airport. Construction on Line 4 started on July 4, 2011. The plans for Line 4 include a two step construction process with the first 28 kilometres (17mi) operational segment to be built between Buenavista and Metro San Lzaro. A later extension would provide travel between San Lzaro and the Airport. The line opened on April 1, 2012. Taxis are in operation in Terminals 1 and 2 and there are two models of service: Ordinary service in a sedan type vehicle for 4 passengers. Executive service in 8 passengers vans. At present there are 5 taxi groups in operation. These are the only taxis authorized by the Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) of the Federal Government. The Terminal 1 taxi boarding areas are located at entrances 1 and 10; and in Terminal 2, boarding areas are located at entrances 3 and 4. Taxi rates are registered under the SCT and include passenger insurance, civil liability and medical expenses for all occupants. To receive the taxi service you must purchase the corresponding ticket previously at the authorized sale points located within the airport. T1 National parking lot is located on Av. Capitn Carlos Len in front of entrances 1 and 2 of the terminal building, in the national arrivals zone. It has the capacity of 1,971 vehicles which are permanently monitored by a modern security and surveillance system, by way of closed circuit TV cameras. T1 International parking lot is located on Av. Capitn Carlos Len in front of the international area of the terminal building, on one side of the long-distance bus terminal. It has a capacity of 2,106 vehicles. An additional parking option for Terminal 1 airport users is Parking Lot 06, located on Sonora street in front of the taxi rank. Because of its location, it is a useful alternative for those visiting the airport customs, loading area, customs agencies and some airline offices. The new AICM Terminal 2 parking lot is located on one side of the Terminal's great central patio. It has the capacity of 2,437 vehicles.
