Kongeegen (the King Oak) is an oak tree in Denmark. It grows in Jgerspris Nordskov (Jgerspris North Forest) near Jgerspris, on the island of Sjlland. It has an estimated age of 15002000 years, and may well be the oldest living oak in northern Europe. It probably originally grew in an open meadow,[1] to account for its short trunk and low branching, with other taller forest trees growing up around it subsequently. The taller trees around it are now shading it and slowly killing it.  
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
