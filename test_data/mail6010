Appel Farm Arts and Music Center, located near Elmer, in Salem County, New Jersey, USA, is a multifaceted nonprofit regional arts center founded by musicians and art educators Albert and Clare Rostan Appel.[1] It is primarily known for its summer camp which began in 1960. Appel Farms mission and programs are built on the philosophy of its founders: to provide people of all ages, cultures, and economic backgrounds with a supportive, cooperative environment in which to explore the arts. This mission is rooted in the belief that the arts are an exciting and essential part of the learning process, and that artistic talent is innate and waiting to be developed in every person. The Arts and Music Center traces its beginnings to 1959 when musicians and arts educators Clare, a German-born refugee and her husband, New Jersey farmer Albert Appel, decided to turn their 176-acre (0.71km2) former farm into a day camp, merging their love for their children and their friends with their interest in music.[2] The first group of campers arrived in the summer of 1960. Over the years, as participation grew, a series of small wooden cabins were constructed in an area around the Appel home. Albert, a violinist, invited guest artists to perform and to instruct the children. Gradually, these activities expanded and full-time professional staff as well as seasonal instructors were hired and the camp became a residential program. The original camp bunks were converted chicken coops, and art instruction was held in a barn. Appel Farm was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in 1978 and, in 1987, Mark Packer, then Camp Director, became Appel Farms Executive Director. Albert Appel officially became Director Emeritus but still actively participates in the organizations operations.[3] An annual arts and music festival was introduced in 1989. While Clare Appel died in 1990, the legacy she and her husband founded continued to grow and diversify. Outreach programs have evolved and continue to flourish. Arts instructional classes and workshops are held on- and off-site. Annually, Appel Farms programs serve a combined audience of approximately 56,000 people, including school children. It receives funding from a variety of public and private sources, including the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, Giving Opportunities to Others (GOTO), and individuals, among others. The landscape of the former farm has evolved as well with improved structures and facilities to accommodate the growth in programming. Today, Appel Farms facilities include the 250-seat Clare Rostan Appel Theatre; a 7,000-square-foot (650m2) Fine Arts Building with studios and gallery space; modern bunkhouses that serve as residential accommodations for conference and summer camp participants; classrooms; a dance studio; a dining hall; two outdoor stages; a swimming pool; practice rooms; photography darkrooms and video studios, and the main administration building. Appel Farm is also home to a wood-fired anagama/noborigama kiln, which was built in partnership with the Perkins Center for the Arts in 2000. Recently, the Center acquired additional land through New Jerseys Green Acres program, which enables this land to be preserved in perpetuity. Appel Farm has received numerous commendations and awards for its work. It has been accredited by the American Camp Association for 39 years. For thirteen consecutive years, it has been recognized by the New Jersey State Council on the Arts as a Major Presenting Organization for its remarkable contributions to the cultural life of New Jersey. Twice, in 2004 and again 2008, Appel Farm was awarded a Governors Award for Tourism for accomplishments associated with its annual Arts and Music Festival. The oldest of Appel Farms programs, the residential Summer Arts Camp provides intensive arts education for children ages 817 in an educational and stimulating environment. In accordance with the Appels belief that all children have innate artistic talent, admission to the Summer Arts Camp Program is based on interest rather than skill level. There is no audition process and the program is non-competitive, encouraging mutual support. Students explore music, visual art, dance, theatre and media arts, and participate in a camp community of shared activities and responsibilities. Cooperation, appreciation for other cultures, and support for one anothers creative pursuits are at the heart of the experience. In addition to 150 campers at any given time, an international staff of over 85 professional artists and arts educators encourages students to develop self-esteem and an appreciation for cultural diversity. In the spirit of cooperation, there is no color war and combat sports are not practiced. During each of the two four-week sessions, students spend five hours each day working in the major and minor areas of study they have chosen: theatre, music, dance, fine arts, or media arts. This instruction provides the children an intensive learning experience. Music, for example, includes private instruction, ensemble work, music theory, and master class and performance classes. The GREEN Corps emphasizes the interrelationship between arts and the environment, fostering environmental consciousness and responsibility while undertaking projects to create art and beautify Appel Farms campus. Children work closely with instructors and their peers. Students may take any course that interests them and are encouraged to explore new artistic genres. Private and recreational time is scheduled into each days activities, and field trips, special evening concerts, and workshops by visiting artists are scheduled throughout the summer. Groups of summer faculty and campers bring engaging outreach activities to area hospitals, nursing homes, youth programs and community centers that have little or no arts programming. Appel Farm's Rising Young Artist Scholarship Program provides life-transforming experiences, giving annual tuition assistance to children who are economically disadvantaged yet artistically inclined. Alumni of the Centers acclaimed Summer Arts Camp include designer Jonathan Adler; violist Toby Appel, soprano Amy Burton; film producer Marie Cantin; composer Michael Kaulkin; Broadway musical director Stephen Oremus; actor Connor Paolo; film executive and producer Karen Rosenfelt; multi-media designer Abigail Rudner; songwriter, performer and record producer Adam Schlesinger; musician Rami Perlman, son of renowned violinist Itzhak Perlman; singer/songwriter Bethany Yarrow, daughter of folksinger Peter Yarrow; actor William Youmans; musician Steve Berlin from Los Lobos[1], composer Chris DeBlasio, Broadway and television actor Daniel Jenkins, and Brett Loewenstern from American Idol. The Centers Concert/Presenting Series offers year-round performances by artists from a variety of musical genres. An average of eight Evening Concerts are scheduled each year at the 250-seat theater. In 2005, Appel Farm performances were expanded to include First Fridays @ the Gallery offering an additional eight shows that feature emerging performers in an intimate, coffeehouse-type setting. Appel Farm, working in cooperation with Washington Township Live Arts, also holds concerts and presentations at the 2,500-seat Commerce Bank Arts Center, located in Sewell, New Jersey. Past performers have included Lonestar, Dave Koz, Sweet Honey in the Rock and the acclaimed Russian folk dance group, the Moiseyev Dance Company. The reach of Appel Farms signature concert event, the annual Appel Farm Arts and Music Festival, extends beyond New Jersey, attracting audiences of upwards of 10,000 from the Eastern seaboard and beyond. Since its premier in 1989, the Festival, held on the first Saturday of June, draws music enthusiasts from throughout the Northeastern corridor of the United States, and from as far away as Texas and California. The family oriented, daylong event offers a lineup of as many as twelve musicians and musical groups, including both recognized as well as emerging artists, performing on two outdoor stages. The Festival also incorporates a Childrens Village featuring childrens theater performances and arts activities and a juried Crafts Fair, which includes exhibitions and demonstrations of artwork in an array of media. Appel Farm's Community Arts Outreach Programs, developed to meet the needs of residents of New Jerseys southwestern counties, continue to grow in size and scope as the needs and expectations of those communities change. Through the Public School Arts Education Programs, Appel Farm partners with elementary and middle schools in inner cities and underserved rural areas of southern New Jersey including Salem, Cumberland, Gloucester and Camden counties.[4] The School Programs consist of Theater in the Schools, Music in the Schools, Visual Arts in the Schools, Dance in the Schools, and Student Theater and Dance Matines. High School Programs include visual arts and music residencies and professional theater performances.[5] Over 20,000 schoolchildren are served by these programs annually. The Family Matine Series presents a variety of childrens performers at the Centers on-site theater, and arts classes at Appel Farm offers instruction in a spectrum of arts media. These on-site programs draw audiences and participants predominately from within a 25-mile (40km) radius. Coordinates: 393449N 751159W / 39.580141N 75.199742W / 39.580141; -75.199742
