Coordinates: 544323N 45723W / 54.72315N 4.95644W / 54.72315; -4.95644 Port Logan, formerly Port Nessock, is a small village in the parish of Kirkmaiden in the Rhins of Galloway in Wigtownshire. The Gaelic name is Port Neasaig. Port Nessock Bay is now all that remains of the western end of a strait that in post-glacial times separated the main part of what is now the Rinns of Galloway from three smaller islands to its south[1]. There was a ruined pier in the bay in 1790, at which time kelp and samphire were gathered on the coast to the south[2]. The village was planned; it was created by Colonel Andrew MacDowall (Douall), the laird of Logan, in 1818. MacDowall erected a quay and bell tower designed by Thomas Telford, and a causewayed road leading to them. This causeway blocked the view to seaward of the existing houses on the Lower Road (Laigh Row), whose inhabitants MacDowall expected to move to a new Upper Road; in the event, they welcomed the shelter it provided from the brisk onshore winds, and preferred to stay put, though subsequently most of them added a second storey so recovering some of the sea view. Facilities include a village hall which used to be the local Lifeboat Station. It is run by a local committee and completely self funding. In recent years it has been used for a range of social events such as weddings and to celebrate Hogmanay and St Andrew's Night. It is sometimes used for meetings of the Kirkmaiden Community Council. There is a tiny part-time post office, and the Port Logan Inn, which since it changed hands in 2006 has been serving good real ale and food. There is a small market garden supplying local businesses and the public. For a couple of years until 2006 they also included a newly-built cafe with excellent views called the Butterchurn; however, this is now closed, and the new owners are seeking planning permission to convert it into a private house. The Logan Fish Pond, Logan Botanic Garden & Logan House Garden [1] are nearby. The village is a popular fishing destination. The village was used at the setting for the popular BBC series Two Thousand Acres of Sky starring actress Michelle Collins between 2001 and 2003. On the 27 July 1944 two United States Army Air Force Douglas C-47 Skytrains (one of them 42-93038) were on a flight from Filton to a stop at Prestwick before flying on to the United States. The flight was transporting wounded soldiers. But the flight encountered bad weather, and the pilot of 42-93038 tried to gain altitude to clear the cliffs. The C-47 crashed into the cliff side at Port Logan where all 22 passengers and crew died.[3]
