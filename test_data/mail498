There is also a cultural centre, "La Mongolfiere", which offers many activities and cultural exhibits. The name was given as a reminder of the first hot air balloon which set off from the chateau de versailles the 19th of September 1783 and landed in Vaucresson, carrying a duck, a rooster and a lamb. Vaucresson is served by Vaucresson station on the Transilien Paris  Saint-Lazare suburban rail line.
