Content:
The International Crop Information System (ICIS) is a database system that provides integrated management of global information on crop improvement and management both for individual crops and for farming systems. Ambiguous germplasm identification, difficulty in tracing pedigree information and lack of integration between genetic resources, breeding, evaluation, utilization and management data have constrained development of more knowledge-intensive crop research efforts. ICIS is being developed by agricultural scientists and information technicians in several centres of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), in Advanced Research Institutions (ARIs), and in National Agricultural Research Systems (NARSs) to address these constraints.
