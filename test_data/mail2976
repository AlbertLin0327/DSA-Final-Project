Drastic Cinematic is an LP by the American synthpop/electro pop band Hyperbubble from German label Pure Pop For Now People. It debuted in Europe and North America on April 2, 2011 as a limited edition of 100 copies with handmade covers.[1] The album includes Welcome To Infinity, released earlier in the year as a single by UK Bubblegum Records. Guest vocals are provided by Aidan Casserly of Empire State Human for the title track. The song "Geometry" includes vocals by Manda Rin of the Scottish bands Bis and Data Panik as well as sampled sounds from her cat, Akiko. A CD/MP3 reissue of this limited edition vinyl album, Drastic Cinematic  Director's Cut, debuted on July 1, 2011 through Bubblegum.[2] The reissue shares the same front cover and adds three remixes by I European, Haberdashery and Mark Towns, who previously worked on Hits! The Very Best of Erasure. With Drastic Cinematic, Hyperbubble produced what was variously dubbed a tribute to soundtrack composers of the '70s and '80s, "a film-noir/futuristic soundtrack," and "a soundtrack for an imaginary Jean-Luc Goddard (sic) film"  the French director to whom the CD version is dedicated.[5][8][9][10] Accordingly, the music includes cameo vocals "with distinctive accents to add foreign intrigue," including "little dialogues in English, French and German."[6][11] Hyperbubble utilizes "their slick melodies as themes instead of verses or choruses, per se, and lets listeners fill in the gaps."[7] The album constituted a change from the band's usual cartoon bubblepunk to more dark and atmospheric moods or "black and white audio noir."[4][6][12] Peek-a-boo music magazine noted that the vocals "in combination with the drums and synthmelodies give a Kraftwerk-feeling."[6] The three bonus tracks provide more conventional synthpop.[12] babysue called it "a non-stop fun experience from start to finish. Totally cool upbeat modern pop tunes presented with gutsy imagination and plenty of style."[3] All songs written by Jess and Jeff DeCuir
