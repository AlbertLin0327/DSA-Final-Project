William Charles (Bill) Summerscales (born 4 January 1949) is a former English footballer. Summerscales played for North Staffordshire College of Technology and Leek Town before joining Port Vale for 400 in February 1970. It took until August 1972 for him to be a mainstay feature of the first team, this was brought abruptly to a halt though on 12 January 1974, when during a 22 draw with York City the Vale Park faithful witnessed Summerscales breaking his neck. Eight months later he had recovered and was back in the squad, but was dropped in March 1975 and given a free transfer two months later. He later played for Rochdale and Stafford Rangers before moving to Australia to join Newcastle United, then returned to England with Marquis.[1] Once he retired from the field, Summerscales became the under-15 coach at Stoke City and a committee member at Redgate United.
