A Szabadsg (The Freedom) is the official newspaper of the Hungarian Communist Workers' Party (Munksprt). It was founded in 1989, as the spiritual successor of the former party newspaper, Npszabadsg. It is a weekly which publishes on Saturday. From 1989, the newspaper releases continuously on a weekly basis, the first issue released in 26 November 1989. Until 2006, it was only black and white (except for the header, which is in red lettering were sorted, later with pink colour). During this period, approximately 10,000 copies sold per week, and it is also sold in newsstands. Between May 2006 and March 2007, the official releasing were ceased, because of the financial problems of Munksprt. A Szabadsg is only able to be read on the Internet, but with big, colourful pictures. The comeback was in March 2007, with a revised design, but with reduced number of copies. Around 3,0004,000 pieces releases every week, of which 500 are in different libraries and the Hungarian Parliament. From 2010 some pages are black and white once again. Since October 2010, the newspaper is available again in selected news stands (mostly in "Relay" and "Inmedio" network). A Szabadsg gets its income mostly from the subscribers.
