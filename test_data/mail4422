William Beattie "Big Chief" Feathers (August 20, 1909  March 11, 1979) was an American football running back in the NFL. He played for the Chicago Bears, Brooklyn Dodgers, and Green Bay Packers during his seven year career. He was the first player in NFL history to rush for over 1,000 yards in one season (1934). He held the NFL single season record for most yards per carry when he averaged 8.44 yards per attempt that same year until the record was broken by Michael Vick during the 2006 season. He attended Virginia High School in Bristol, and led the school to its first state championship as team captain before going on to the University of Tennessee. After his career in the NFL, Feathers went on to coach football at Appalachian State and North Carolina State. He also coached baseball at Texas Tech[1] and Wake Forest.
