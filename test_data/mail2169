The Interns is an American medical drama series that aired on CBS from 1970 to 1971. It was based on the 1962 film The Interns and the 1964 sequel The New Interns. The stories centered on the activities of Dr. Peter Goldstone (Broderick Crawford) and five medical interns at New North Hospital. The series dealt with issues of the day including the racism faced by one of the African American interns. The other interns consisted of a newlywed, two bachelors, and a female.
