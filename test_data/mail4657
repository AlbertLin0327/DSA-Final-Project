The Saturday Magazine is a radio programme broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster, Saturdays, 10.05am-11am. Every Saturday morning at 10am on BBC Radio Ulster, John Toal shares his listeners interest in life in The Saturday Magazine, covering a wide range of subjects from hobbies to health, and from family life to food. Since hitting the airwaves just over two years ago, The Saturday Magazine has become an entertaining and essential listen for a growing and very dedicated listener following. Within this hour, listeners can hear big name interviews, compelling personal stories, the latest album reviews with music guru Stuart Bailie and, of course, some mouth-watering recipes cooked live in studio by The Saturday Magazines resident chef Paula McIntyre. John says: The Saturday Magazine is very broad in the subjects that it covers. Sometimes youll laugh out loud and sometimes youll shed a tear, but we always aim to be thought-provoking and entertaining...and Paula and Stuart are integral parts of the shows success. The number of times people have stopped me to say they bought that album and liked it or tried to make that dish but burnt it encourages me that were on to something.
