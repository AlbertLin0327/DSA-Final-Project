United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379, adopted on November 10, 1975 by a vote of 72 to 35 (with 32 abstentions), "determine[d] that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination". The resolution was revoked by Resolution 46/86 on December 16, 1991. In the history of the UN, this is the only resolution that has ever been revoked.[1] On 29 November 1947, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution recommending to the United Kingdom, as the mandatory Power for Palestine, and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation, with regard to the future government of Palestine, of the Plan of Partition with Economic Union as Resolution 181 (II).[2] The Plan contained a proposal to terminate the British Mandate for Palestine and partition Palestine into Independent Arab and Jewish States and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem. During the 1947-1948 Civil War in Palestine, the UN Security Council passed Resolutions 42 (5 March 1948), 43 (1 Apr), 44 (1 Apr) and 46 (17 Apr), which recommended both sides of the conflict to "[r]efrain, pending the future government of Palestine ... from any political activity which might prejudice the rights, claims, or position of either community". On May 14, 1948, on the day in which the British Mandate over a Palestine expired, the Jewish People's Council gathered at the Tel Aviv Museum, and approved a proclamation which declared the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel.[3] The 1948 Palestinian exodus, known in Arabic as the Nakba (Arabic: , an-Nakbah, lit. "disaster", "catastrophe", or "cataclysm"),[4] occurred when approximately 711,000 to 725,000 Palestinian Arabs left, fled or were expelled from their homes, during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and the Civil War that preceded it.[5] The exact number of refugees is a matter of dispute.[6] The causes remain the subject of fundamental disagreement between Arabs and Israelis.
