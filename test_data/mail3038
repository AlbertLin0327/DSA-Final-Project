Samuel Alken Sr. (b. London, October 22, 1756 - d. London, November 9, 1815) was an English artist.[1] Samuel Alken entered the Royal Academy Schools, London, as a sculptor in 1772. In 1779, he published A New Book of Ornaments Designed and Etched by Samuel Alken, afterwards establishing himself as one of the most competent engravers in the new technique of aquatint. The Alken family claims several well known artists[2]. There are some sporting paintings signed S. Alken, but they may be the work of his eldest son, Samuel.
