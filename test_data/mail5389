Middleweight (2001-2011) Kazuo Misaki (born April 25, 1976) is a Japanese professional mixed martial artist and former judoka. He was the 2006 Pride Welterweight Grand Prix winner, and is currently competing in Sengoku. He is a long time veteran of Pancrase and has also competed in Strikeforce. On route to the finals he defeated Phil Baroni and PRIDE Welterweight Champion Dan Henderson in a non-title bout. Misaki was eliminated in the semifinals by Paulo Filho, but Filho injured his knee during the contest and was unable to continue to the finals. Misaki was named as his replacement and defeated Denis Kang by split decision. His last fight in Pride was a unanimous decision loss to Frank Trigg at PRIDE 33 on February 24, 2007. At the Yarennoka event on New Year's Eve 2007, he fought Yoshihiro Akiyama. The original result of the match was a knockout victory for Misaki, but Akiyama protested the finish.[1] The knockout kick came as Akiyama attempted to get back to his feet after being knocked down by Misaki.[1] Akiyama contested that one or more of his hands were on the mat at the time of the kick, which would make the kick illegal under Yarennoka! rules.[1] After reviewing video of the knockout, the Yarennoka executive committee agreed; the official result was then changed to "no contest."[1] He went on to fight in World Victory Road's inaugural event "Sengoku", on March 5, 2008, where he defeated Shooto light heavyweight champion Siyar Bahadurzada[2] and won by guillotine choke at 2:02 of the second round. His next fight was at Sengoku 3 on June 8, 2008, where he beat Logan Clark by unanimous decision. He then signed with U.S.-based Strikeforce organization in 2008, where he was scheduled to fight Joe Riggs but was forced to pull out due to injury. Misaki then faced off against MWGP winner Jorge Santiago to determine WVR's first MW champion. Misaki was utilizing striking to keep Santiago at a distance, countering his kicks and punches. Misaki was dominating the fight until he got taken down and submitted in the final round.[3] On November 8, 2009 Misaki announced he was leaving his long time gym GRABAKA. Misaki recently lost to K-1 fighter Melvin Manhoef via a controversial stoppage at Dynamite!! 2009. Misaki was dropped by a punch from Manhoef and the referee stopped the fight before Manhoef could follow him to the ground. In his welterweight debut, Misaki faced Paul Daley at Strikeforce: Tate vs. Rousey. He won the fight via split decision. On March 19, 2009, Misaki was pulled over by a police officer for talking on his cellphone while driving, when pulling over Misaki attempted to flee the scene, knocking into the arresting officers' car. On June 26, the Tokyo District Court sentenced him to one year of prison, which has been suspended for three years. Misaki fought and beat Kazuhiro Nakamura at Sengoku 9, however he did not receive pay, and went on immediate indefinite suspension after the fight.[4]
