Psycho Cop is a 1989 horror film starring Robert R. Shafer as Police Officer Joe Vickers. The film is very similar to Maniac Cop, though the titular character is not a mutilated monster, unlike Maniac Cop. Also like the Maniac Cop series this film was criticized by the Police Interest Group for what they considered an unrealistic portrayal of police. The film spawned a sequel, Psycho Cop 2, in 1993. The film is currently unavailable on DVD in Region 1.
