The part of the Latvian fleet that fought for the Allies in World War II under the flag of Latvia consisted of eight freighters: Abagra, Ciltvaira, Regent, Everasma, Everalda, Everelza, egums, and Everagra. Only two of them: Everagra and egums survived the war.[1][2][3] After the USSR took over Latvia on June 17, 1940 and the country was annexed to the Soviet Union, the Soviet authorities issued orders for Latvian fleet to return home. Some of the ships obeyed the order, and their crews were deported to Gulag labor camps. The eight ships denied the order. A town of Nags Head, North Carolina has a street named after Ciltvaira,[3] which was the first Latvian ship sunk by Germans. It was torpedoed by German submarine U-123 in the nearby coastal waters on 19 January 1942. [4] The same year five more ships were sunk: the Everasma on Feb. 28, the Abagra on May 6, the Regent on June 14, the Everalda on June 29, the Everelza on Aug. 13. Everagra was torpedoed on July 8, 1943,[5] but survived and served until 1957. egums served until 1948.[1]
