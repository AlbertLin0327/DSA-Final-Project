"Curtis Steele" (Housename) Operator #5 was a pulp hero that appeared in his own ten cent pulp magazine. It was soon renamed Secret Service Operator #5 and was published by Popular Publications between 1934 and 1939.[1] In the magazines America was still deep in the Great Depression and Jimmy Christopher was a secret agent, codename "Operator No. 5" for the United States Intelligence in a series of fast paced stories about America's enemies who pledged war, death and bloody destruction in their efforts to take over America. The enemies were many, but often from countries with fictional names. Christopher had two trademarks: a skull ring and a rapier which was kept curled inside his belt. He was aided by a number of people in the various wars: Diane Elliot, his girlfriend; Tim Donovan, who quickly grew from a youngster to a two fisted young man; Nan Christopher, his twin sister; John Christopher, his father who was a retired operative known as Q-6; Chief of Intelligence Z-7; and friend "Slips" McGuire, among many others, some of whom gave their lives for America. The magazine ran for 48 issues, from April 1934 to November 1939. One final story was written but never published. Stories were credited to "Curtis Steele", which was a house name for writers Frederick C. Davis (#1-20), Emile C. Tepperman (#21-39), and Wayne Rogers (#40-48). Like other such pulps of the day, there were short backup stories by other authors. Tepperman was responsible for the 13 interconnected novels (starting with #26) that make up The Purple Invasion, a series in which the Purple Empire (an unnamed European power which is a thinly veiled Germany) conquers the United States after conquering the rest of the world. Jimmy Christopher led the insurgency against them. The saga is often looked upon as the War and Peace of pulps[2]. The entire Purple Invasion sequence was reprinted in the 1990s by Pulp Review/High Adventure. In a rare bit of continuity for the pulp magazines, America did not find itself fully recovered in the first novel following the end of the Purple Invasion. Instead, America was still reeling from the bloody war, and found itself vulnerable to yet other would-be conquerors. A new serial dealt with the invasion of the US by an oriental power, obviously Japan, led by the "Yellow Vulture." This sequence started with issue #45, but was left unfinished with the magazine's cancellation. In the 1920's and 30's America considered invading a number of countries (actually much of the world) which might in some way be a danger to it in future. These plans were assigned colours as in Red for Britain, Orange for Japan, Green for Mexico, Purple for South America, Black for Germany, Grey for the Caribbean, Yellow for China and Brown for the Philippines. There was even a White for a domestic uprising. [1] As times changed with a real war in progress, so Russia became Red and Japan became Yellow. In the 1960s, at the height of the camp craze and the success of the Doc Savage reprints, Corinth Press (an imprint of soft porn publisher Regency) issued nine Operator 5 adventures in paperback. Their low distribution made them collector's items almost from the very first, but didn't generate enough sales to continue the series. Two later attempts were also made to reprint the stories.[3] Currently, Wildside Press has been reprinting stories. In 2011, Moonstone began running new licensed stories of Operator 5 as a back-up feature in The Spider comic book, another Popular Publications character.
