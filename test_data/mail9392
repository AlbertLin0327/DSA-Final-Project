The island nation of Kiribati first participated in the 2004 Summer Olympic Games. Its delegation consisted of weightlifter Meamea Thomas and sprinters Kakianako Nariki and Kaitinano Mwemweata. After participating in the Commonwealth Games for the first time in 1998, Kiribati started working towards membership of the International Olympic Committee. During a meeting of the IOC in Prague in 2003, Kiribati was accepted into the organization and was set to participate in the 2004 games. The country's name was notably mispronounced by officials in all three languages -French, English and Greek- during the opening ceremony.[1]
