A jarocho is a person, item or style of music from Veracruz, Mexico. One explanation of the origin of the term jarocho is that it evolved from an old Spanish word meaning brusque or disordered. There are many other theories. Musical groups of jarochos are bands of minstrel musicians, similar to mariachis, who dress and play in the Veracruz style. They are distinguished from mariachis by their traditional white guayabera shirts and white pants and hats. Music played by jarochos is known as Son Jarocho. By extension, the term is sometimes applied to all people living in Veracruz. More properly, as custom has dictated, it should be limited to the southern coastal regions of Veracruz, and more particularly, to the local campesinos living along the valley of the Papaloapan river, specially those in or near the towns of Cosamaloapan, Tlacotalpan, and Alvarado.
