President's Park (commonly known around campus as "The Park") is the largest housing area on the George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia, campus. It is specifically designated for freshman. It is located on the University's Fairfax Campus on Patriot Circle between the Aquatic Center and Shenandoah River Lane. The thirteen buildings (twelve residential which house around 1,200 students) were opened in 1989. A $3.3M renovation project will update President's Park during the summers of 2008 and 2009.[1] The 1st-year students live in one, two, three, and five person rooms varying in size.

There are also free laundry facilities in the lobbies of the Lincoln, Adams, and Harrison buildings. All of the buildings are named after past U.S. Presidents:
