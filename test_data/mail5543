George Wilson,known as the Blackheath pedestrian, (24 June 1766 to after 1822) was a Newcastle born character, and competitive walker/athlete, and a tax collector by trade, George Wilson was mentioned on page 180 by W & T Fordyce (publishers) in the The Tyne Songster published in 1840, in the song "On Russell The Pedestrian. It is not written in a Geordie dialect, but has a strong Northern connection. The notes to the song mention that Mr Russell was walking 101 miles in 23 hours, 56 minutes and 30 seconds on the 25 and 26 June 1822 on Newcastle Racecourse. On Easter Monday and Tuesday, George Wilson had walked 90 miles in 24 successive hours. George Wilson wrote his autobiography entitled A Sketch of the Life of George Wilson, the Blackheath Pedestrian: Who Undertook to Walk One Thousand Miles in Twenty Days! which was illustrated by Thomas Charles Wageman in 1815[1]. In this book he tells of his many exploits and failures, including him being arrested for causing a breach of the peace, charged and tried for "walking for money" and ending up in debtors prison.
