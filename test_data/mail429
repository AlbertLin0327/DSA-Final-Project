HMS Anglesey (P277) BNS Gomati is an Island Class Offshore patrol vessel of the Bangladeshi Navy. She was built as Royal Navy Offshore Patrol Vessel, HMS Anglesey (P277). Launched on 18 October 1978,[2] HMS Anglesey (P277) was delivered to the Royal Navy in 1979.[1] Anglesey was one of the first rescue vessels on the scene of the disastrous Fastnet Race of August 1979. She picked up seven survivors from the race,[3] in which 15 died. Paid off on 31 July 2003, Anglesey was sold to the Bangladesh Navy on 28 August 2003 and renamed Gomati on 9 September 2003. Four other ships of the same class were added to Bangladesh Navy's fleet in 2003/04 to protect the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in Bay of Bengal.[4] The island class patrol boats were built to enforce a 200-mile (320km) fishing zone around the UK.[3] The Gomati is currently under the command of the Commodore Commanding Khulna (COMKHUL). About 100 personnel serve at Gomati, which is categorized as Large Offshore Patrol Vessel in the Bangladesh Navy.
