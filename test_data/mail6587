As of 31 December 2004, it had a population of 992 and an area of 26.7km.[1] The name of the town deirives from the Latin Calcis Mons which refers to the calcium rich soil of the area. Chiomonte was before the 8th century located on the south side of the valley in which it lies but after a landslide the town moved to its present location. The municipality of Chiomonte contains the frazioni (subdivisions, mainly villages and hamlets) Frais and Ramat. Chiomonte borders the following municipalities: Giaglione, Exilles, Gravere, and Usseaux. The 15th century church of Santa Maria is of particular interest. Chiomonte is famous too for its ice wine and is one of the few areas in Italy producing this type of wine. [IMG]
