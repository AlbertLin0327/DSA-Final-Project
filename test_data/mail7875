Ampelovirus Closterovirus Crinivirus The Closteroviridae are a family of viruses plant viruses with filamentous, helically constructed particles showing distinct cross-banding and varying in length from 650 nanometers (nm) to over 2000 nm. The genome is a single strand of positive sense RNA whose size varies from 13 - 19 kilobases. The genera differ in genome type and transmission vector. Ampeloviruses are bipartite and transmitted by pseudococcid mealybugs and soft scale insects; Closterovirus are monopartite and transmitted by aphids; Criniviruses are tripartite and transmitted by whiteflies.
