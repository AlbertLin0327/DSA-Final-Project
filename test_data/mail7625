Ceux qui inventent n'ont jamais vcu (?) (Those who invent have never lived (?)) is the second album by Fly Pan Am. It was released by Constellation Records in April 2002. The album, as stated by Constellation Records, has a recurrent theme of "self-sabotage".[3] Electronic noises and textures disrupt and often serve to confuse the listener; the track "Sound-support surface noises reaching out to you" includes sounds mimicking a skipping CD. Alexandre St-Onge, long-time contributor to Fly Pan Am, provides electronic manipulation for the second track.[3] The recording also includes input and performances from many musicians, including David Bryant and Bruce Cawdron from Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Sam Shalabi from Shalabi Effect.[3] The taping and mixing was done at the communal Montreal-based Hotel2Tango in 2001 by Thierry Amar and Efrim Menuck.[3] The artwork was produced by the band members.[3] The album title may refer to a sentence pronounced in Gil J Wolman's film L'Anticoncept.
