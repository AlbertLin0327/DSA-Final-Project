The term beam and block refers to a construction method for flooring, especially that of ground floors. It is made of cast concrete, one piece of which is similar to an inverted 'T' shape, the other being a simple rectangular block. The blocks are placed at regular intervals and the beams placed between them to form a connection between each block section. They form a support for the next layer of flooring materials. 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
