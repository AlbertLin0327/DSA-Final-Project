It was built in 1933 as a part of the Works Progress Administration initiated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Coast Guard Station played a part in World War II when it helped save the passengers of two merchant ships, the SSOklahoma and the Esso Baton Rouge. These two ships were torpedoed by a German submarineU-123. The station is one of the forty five originally built by President Roosevelt, and is one of the few that has survived to this day. It is now a museum.
