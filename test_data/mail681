bullet weight 0.048kg The Yakushev-Borzov YakB-12.7 mm is a remotely controlled 12.7x108mm caliber four-barrel Gatling gun developed by the Soviet Union for the Mil Mi-24 attack gunship and low-capacity troop transporter with 1470 rounds, which can also be mounted in GUV-8700 machine-gun pods with 750 rounds. It has a high rate of fire and is also one of the few self-powered guns of the Gatling type. On the Mi-24 it is mounted in the VSPU-24 undernose turret, with an azimuth of 60 to either side, an elevation of 20, and a depression of 60. The gun is slaved to the KPS-53AV undernose sighting system with a reflector sight in the front cockpit. It was replaced by fixed chin-mounted GSh-30K or larger caliber flexible GSh-23L in the late mark of the Mi-24 helicopters due to not doing enough damage to dug-in or lightly armored targets that didn't necessitate a rocket attack.[1]
