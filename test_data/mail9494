Ensure is the brand name of liquid nutritional supplements manufactured by Abbott Laboratories.[1] First produced in 1973 as a medical nutrition product, Ensure beverages are formulated to provide calories, protein and essential vitamins and minerals. Ensure products provide a source of nutrition that can help with healthy aging, recovery from illness, injury or surgery and managing medical conditions that cause an inability to eat, appetite loss, or overall weight loss. In 2009 Abbott Laboratories sold over $1 billion of its liquid nutritional supplements, Ensure, and the related pediatric product, PediaSure.[1] In 2012, Abbott announced a new manufacturing facility in Tipp City, Ohio for the production of Ensure and Glucerna, a nutritional product for people with type 2 diabetes. The facility will become operational in late 2013 (http://www.daytondailynews.com/business/abbott-to-begin-building-270m-plant-1350300.html).
