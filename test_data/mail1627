Rifkat Ibragimovich Bogdanov (born 1950) is a Soviet and Russian mathematician known for contributions to nonlinear dynamical systems, bifurcation theory, and differential geometry. He is an ethnic Tatar. In his work on bifurcations of limit cycles and versal deformations of singular points of vector fields (197576), he described a bifurcation of co-dimension 2, which has become known in the literature as the Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. Born in the village of Mamykovo in Tatarstan, Bogdanov has a doctorate in physico-mathematical sciences and he is a professor in two Russian research organizations: the Skobeltsyn Institute of Nuclear Physics at Lomonosov Moscow State University and the Department of Higher Mathematics at MATI  the Tsiolkovskii State Technological University.
