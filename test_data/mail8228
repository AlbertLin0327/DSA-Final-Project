Radyo Natin 91.7 San Jose in the province of Antique, Philippines is one of the 100 Radyo Natin stations nationwide which started to operate in 1986. It is authorized to broadcast commercially by the NTC (National Telecommunications Commission) under license number BSD-0271-2003. DYRS FM Radyo Natin San Jose Antique is a member of the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP)which pledges itself to the highest standard of broadcasting ethics and above all, dedication to the national interest. The station operates with the power of 500 watts. In 1986, it was managed and maintained by an RN-OIC and RN- Technician until 1999. During these times, all station operations came from Manila Broadcasting Company (MBC) Radyo Natin Center in Metro Manila. The OIC then acts as a full time DJ, newscaster, program host and commentator. The RN Technician also acts as the cashier and janitor. In September 1999, the MBC management decided to offer the rights of the station to all interested RN-OICs and Technicians and RN-San Jose in Antique was given to Mr. Teody N. Siesa, the OIC of the station at that time, as a partner of MBC to operate the station locally. Since then, RN-San Jose Antique was fully managed and operated by Mr. Teody N. Siesa under his business name System Information Entertainment Sales and Advertising. Mr. Teody Siesa, in his capacity improved the facilities and programming of the station, hired credible DJs, anchormen and newscasters which made Radyo Natin San Jose the most listened station in the Province of Antique. Through the years and in the midst of the challenges and call of times, Radyo Natin San Jose remains trusted, humble, fair and balanced in its field.
