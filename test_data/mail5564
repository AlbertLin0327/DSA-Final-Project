The Bangladesh International School Dammam (BISD) is located in Dammam, Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. The school has two sections: H E Hedayet Ahmed, then Ambassador of Bangladesh, proposed the school as a part of the education and cultural wing of the Bangladesh Embassy in Saudi Arabia. It was established on 1 January 1987. AK Azad runs the school as Vice Principal. BISD follows the University of Cambridge Local Examination Syndicate (UCLES) for its course structure. Students appear for their 'O' level examination after completing Grade X under UCLES and 'A' level examination after completing Grade XII under UCLES. Both of the examinations take place with the supervision of the British Council situated in Eastern Province. At the 2006 British Council annual awards ceremony, Muhammad Ehsanul Hoque was honoured for achieving first place in mathematics and economics at 'A' level. Akil Muhammad Habibullah was ranked first in chemistry at 'O' level.[1] At the graduation ceremony, in May 2007, it was announced that in 2006 the school had a 100 per cent success rate for students in their final examinations.[2]
