Coordinates: 260421N 0800910W / 26.0725N 80.15278W / 26.0725; -80.15278 Fort Lauderdale  Hollywood International Airport (IATA: FLL,ICAO: KFLL,FAA LID: FLL) is an international commercial airport located in unincorporated Broward County, Florida,[3] three miles (5km) southwest of the central business district of Fort Lauderdale.[2] It is also located near the city of Hollywood and is 21 miles (33.7km) north of Miami. In 2011, the airport processed 23,349,835 passengers[1] (4.2% increase over 2010) including 3,608,922 international passengers (4.7% increase over 2010). In 2010, FLL showed significant growth in traffic. That year the facility far surpassed 2007/2008 levels by 728,147 passengers, regaining its status as one the fastest-growing airports in the United States. From June 2010 through May 2011, the top five air carriers in terms of domestic market share were: Southwest Airlines at 18.9%; Spirit Airlines at 17.3%; JetBlue Airways at 16.6%; Delta Air Lines at 16.5%; and US Airways at 8.8%.[4] FLL is ranked as the 22nd busiest airport (in terms of passenger traffic) in the United States as well as the nation's 14th busiest international air gateway. The facility also ranks as one of the 50 busiest airports in the world. FLL is classified by the US Federal Aviation Administration as a "Major Hub" facility serving commercial air traffic. Fort Lauderdale  Hollywood International Airport serves as a focus city for Allegiant Air, JetBlue Airways, and Caribbean Airlines. The airport is the largest base for Spirit Airlines, catering mainly to the airline's international to domestic network. It is also a hub for Silver Airways under the United Express name and Lynx Air International. The airport's close proximity to cruise line terminals at Port Everglades has also made it popular among tourists bound for the Caribbean. Since the late 1990s, FLL has emerged as an intercontinental gateway as well, especially for charter carriers, although Miami International Airport still handles most long-haul flights to and from South Florida. The airport offers free Wi-Fi Internet access throughout its terminals. Merle Fogg Airport opened on an abandoned 9-hole golf course on May 1, 1929. At the start of World War II, it was commissioned by the United States Navy and renamed Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale. The base was initially used for refitting civil airliners for military service before they were ferried across the South Atlantic to Europe and North Africa. NAS Fort Lauderdale later became a main training base for Naval Aviators and enlisted naval air crewmen flying the TBF and TBM Avenger for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps aboard aircraft carriers and from expeditionary airfields ashore. NAS Fort Lauderdale was the home base for Flight 19, the five TBM Avenger aircraft that disappeared in December 1945, leading in part to the notoriety of the Bermuda Triangle. NAS Fort Lauderdale was closed on October 1, 1946 and transferred to county control, becoming Broward County International Airport. Commercial flights to Nassau began on June 2, 1953 and domestic flights began in 1958-59: Northeast Airlines and National Airlines DC-6Bs flew nonstop to Idlewild, and Northeast flew nonstop to Washington National. In 1959 the airport opened its first permanent terminal building and assumed its current name. Operations at FLL didn't grow along with Broward County's population. Low-cost traffic propelled the airport's growth in the 1990s, with Southwest opening its base in 1996, Spirit in 1999, and JetBlue in 2001. Spirit made FLL a hub in 2002 and in 2003 JetBlue made FLL a focus city. During the 2005 hurricane season FLL was affected by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Wilma. Katrina struck as a Category 1 and caused minor damage, however the airport was closed for about a 48 hour period. However, when Hurricane Wilma made landfall in October roof damage was reported along with broken windows, damaged jetways, and destroyed canopies. The airport was closed for a period of 5 days. Hurricane Wilma was a Category 2 when its center passed to the west of FLL. Beginning February 2007 the airport initiated user fees to all users, including private aircraft. It is one of a handful of airports to administer fees to private pilots. A minimum charge of $10 is assessed to private aircraft which land at the airport. The airport has been used by filmmakers numerous times, the most famous of these being scenes from Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise. Fort Lauderdale  Hollywood International Airport covers an area of 1,380 acres (558ha) and has three runways:[2] In 2003, plans were started to expand the facility to meet increasing demand. Proposed improvements include an extension of runway 9R/27L to accommodate larger air carrier jet aircraft,[5] construction and modifications to the airport's taxiway system to provide for increased speed, improved inter-terminal passenger movement and extensive terminal upgrades. As of April 25, 2006 the master plan for this expansion was being updated for a second time. Concerns and complaints by nearby communities about increased noise from larger jet aircraft, along with concerns about buyout requirements, have delayed construction that is expected to keep Fort Lauderdale  Hollywood International Airport viable through 2020.[6] On June 5, 2007, Broward County commissioners voted six to three in favor of extending the southern 9R/27L runway. The proposal looks to extend the runway to over 8,000ft (2,400m). over a five year period. Currently, the plan is being sent for approval by the FAA.[7] Gulfstream International Airlines has its headquarters in Suite 201 of the 1100 Lee Wagener Blvd building.[8][9] When Chalk's International Airlines existed, its headquarters was on the grounds of the airport in an unincorporated area.[10] Fort Lauderdale  Hollywood International Airport has four terminals. Terminal 1, commonly referred to as "The New Terminal," opened in stages between 2001 and 2003. The other three terminals were constructed in the mid-1980s as part of a $263 million construction project. Terminal 4, commonly referred to as the International Terminal, was inaugurated by a Concorde visit in 1983. See Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport FLL is served by Broward County Transit bus Route 1 which offers connecting service through the Central Terminal, and also service to Aventura, in Miami-Dade County. Rail service between Miami and West Palm Beach is provided by Tri-Rail commuter rail service at the Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport station, accessible via a free Tri-Rail shuttle from the main terminals. The shuttle stops at 3 locations at the airport, all on the lower level: west end of terminal 1, between terminals 2 and 3, and between terminals 3 and 4. The shuttle operates 7 days a week. The airport also offers airport parking and operates a consolidated rental car facility which can be accessed from Terminal 1 by a short walk and from the other terminals by a free shuttle bus service. On May 18, 1972, an Eastern Air Lines McDonnell Douglas DC-9-31 had its landing gear collapse and tail section separate during landing. The aircraft then caught fire but all passengers and crew were able to safely evacuate.[17]  Atlanta (HartsfieldJackson Atlanta International Airport  ATL) Baltimore (Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport  BWI) Boston (Logan International Airport  BOS) Charlotte (Charlotte/Douglas International Airport  CLT) Chicago (O'Hare International Airport  ORD) Cleveland (Cleveland Hopkins International Airport - CLE) Dallas-Fort Worth (Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport  DFW) Denver (Denver International Airport  DEN) Detroit (Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport  DTW) Fort Lauderdale (Fort Lauderdale  Hollywood International Airport  FLL) Honolulu (Honolulu International Airport  HNL) Houston (George Bush Intercontinental Airport  IAH) Las Vegas (McCarran International Airport  LAS) Los Angeles (Los Angeles International Airport  LAX) Miami (Miami International Airport  MIA) Minneapolis  Saint Paul (MinneapolisSaint Paul International Airport  MSP) Newark (Newark Liberty International Airport  EWR) New York (John F.
