BRP Gregorio del Pilar (PF-15) is a Philippine Navy high endurance cutter. From 1967-2011, it was then known as USCGCHamilton(WHEC-715) and served the US Coast Guard. It was decommissioned on March 28, 2011 and was acquired by the Philippines under the Excess Defense Articles and the Foreign Assistance Act.[3] Gregorio del Pilar was the second Philippine Navy ship to have borne the same name, the first being another ex-US Coast Guard cutter. Gregorio del Pilar is one of the first of several ex-US Coast Guard Hamilton-class cutters expected to serve the Philippine Navy.[4] The ship was designed with a high level of habitability and provides fairly comfortable accommodations, including air conditioning.[5] Gregorio del Pilar is the first Philippine military vessel to employ the now common shipboard application of aircraft gas turbine jet engines with the use of controllable pitch propellers. Gregorio del Pilar is equipped with two 18,000 horsepower (13,000kW) Pratt & Whitney[6][6] gas turbines and can propel the ship at speeds up to 28 knots (52km/h). Gregorio del Pilar also has two 3,500 horsepower (2,600kW) Fairbanks-Morse[6] diesel engines, capable of driving the ship economically at 17 knots (31km/h) for up to 14,400 nautical miles (26,700 km) without refueling.[6] A retractable/rotatable bow propulsion unit provides maneuverability in tight situations. Prior to turn-over to the Philippine Navy, the ship was armed with a Mk.75 Oto Melara 76 mm Compact main gun, two Mk.38 M242 Bushmaster 25 mm chain gun at midships, and a Phalanx CIWS system aft.[7] The CIWS and chain guns were removed prior to its turn-over, with the Mk.75 gun remaining. The Gregorio del Pilar has a flight deck and hangar capable of handling helicopters. Currently, a BO-105 light surveillance helicopter is assigned to the ship. Proposal to decommission the ship was made for fiscal year 2011 budget, and the Philippines sent a formal letter of interest for its purchase. As an Excess Defense Article (EDA), transfer took place as is. The US Coast Guard invited the Philippines to send technical teams to the cutter's homeport of San Diego during consecutive weeks in November 2010 to conduct a thorough inspection, known as a Joint Visual Inspection (JVI) of the vessel. The Philippine Navy sent its acting head, and conducted full reviews, both dockside and underway, of their prospective cutters structural condition, propulsion systems, engineering plan, material history and any corrosion issues.[8] From January 2011, the US Coast Guard provided 10 weeks of combined dockside and underway training on Hamilton's sistership, the USCGCBoutwell(WHEC-719) for ship's prospective commanding officer, executive officer and crew. Phase I of the training, from late February until the end of April 2011, involved training 21 members of its prospective crew. The Philippine Navy crew trained on the Boutwell during its maneuvers off the coasts of Mexico and Panama. Phase II of additional dockside and underway training began on 14 May 2011. For 10 weeks, 11 Coast Guard advisors and subject matter experts helped train the remaining 75 crew members. This included the ship's layout, navigation systems, and operating, casualty and maintenance procedures that would allow the safe operation of the ship back to the Philippines.[8] The Hamilton was formally decommissioned on late March 2011, and the US Coast Guard removed the ships AN/SPS-40 air surface search radar to use as spares for operational Hamilton-classcutters. Also removed was the ships Phalanx CIWS and 2 Mk.38 M242 Bushmaster 25 mm chain guns, which will be used on their new National Security Cutters (NSCs) and Sentinel-class Fast Response Cutters, respectively. In return, the US Coast Guard began procuring and installing the safe-to-sail navigation equipment, radar systems and additional electronics that the Philippines' requested as part of its transfer support case.[8] The Philippine Navy plans to install a 25mm chain gun, six mounted 50-caliber guns and two 20mm cannons.[2] The ex-Hamilton was formally transferred to the Philippine government on 13 May 2011 during ceremonies at Coast Guard Island, and was renamed BRP Gregorio del Pilar (PF-15). The ship was then turned over to its Filipino crew, with Capt. Alberto A. Cruz as its first commanding officer.[8] After June 30, the BRP Gregorio del Pilar moved from Coast Guard Island to a commercial pier in Alameda to finish the remaining work, with around 13 separate contracting actions. In early July, the ship did a four-day run at sea along the coast of California for a test of the crews capabilities and the ships sea-worthiness. After that, the American trainers disembarked and left the Filipino naval officers and men on their own. She officially got underway on July 18th from Coast Guard Island Alameda on the voyage home to the Philippines and was expected to arrive in mid-August 2011.[9] In late July 2011, she passed by Hawaii for a brief port visit and during mid Aug. 2011 in Guam prior to arriving in the Philippines on August 21, 2011.[10] The ship arrived in Philippine territory last August 17 after almost a month of voyage from California, and arrived in Manila on 21 August 2011. After the arrival ceremony on 23 August 2011, the ship underwent dry-docking and repainting to standard haze grey. Some minor repairs and fitting of additional facilities, equipment and armaments was done.[11][12] The ship was formally commissioned at 10:00 a.m. of 14 December 2011 during ceremonies in Manila South Harbor Pier 13. President Benigno Aquino III's elder sister, Maria Elena Ballsy Cruz served as the principal sponsor of the ship.[13] President Benigno Aquino III hopes that this, his first major military acquisition, will be a symbol of his administration's intention to strengthen and modernize the Philippine Navy and Armed Forces, and to defend its territory and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea, also known as the West Philippine Sea.[14] [12] The ship's transfer cost was pegged at Php450 million (around US$13.18 million as of 2011), while operation costs for 2 years was estimated at Php120 million. Funding came from Philippines' Department of Energy, considering that the vessel is projected to be deployed to secure oil platform and exploration activities in the Western and Southern Philippines.[15] Originally the Philippine Navy's Organizational and Manpower Management Committee, which deliberated on the possible names for the vessel, came up with three candidate names  Barko ng Republika ng Pilipinas (BRP) Lapu-Lapu, BRP Gregorio del Pilar, and BRP Jose Torres Bugallon. Ultimately the panel confirmed the name Gregorio del Pilar in honor of the young general of the Philippine Revolution who was the hero of the Battle of Tirad Pass during the Philippine-American War where he lost his life.[15] On 27 July 2011, the BRP Gregorio del Pilar arrived at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam for a scheduled port visit. She took on supplies and fuel, and held a reception hosted by the Philippine Consulate in Honolulu and the Philippine Celebrations Coordinating Committee of Hawaii. The crew also visited the USS Arizona Memorial. It also marks the first time a Philippine naval vessel pulled into Pearl Harbor.[16][10] After her stop at Hawaii, she arrived for a port visit to Guam on 12 August 2011, and departed on 14 August 2011 on the way to the Philippines.[17][18] On 30 July 2011, the Gregorio del Pilar and USSReuben James(FFG-57) conducted a Passing Exercise (PASSEX) off the coast of Hawaii.[10] On 22 August 2011, the United States Embassy in Manila posted on their Facebook account photos indicating that BRP Gregorio del Pilar had an in-stride training with USSFitzgerald(DDG-62) on their transit to Guam, which may have started around 4 August 2011.[19] On 8 Apirl 2012 the Gregorio del Pilar was assigned to patrol the Panatag Shoal (Bajo de Masinloc) and was transferred from Palawan to Northern Luzon, and on 10 April 2012 it was involved in a standoff with Chinese vessels during an attempted arrest of Chinese fishers on eight vessels near the shoal, located in a disputed portion of the West Philippine Sea. She intercepted eight Chinese fishing vessels that were allegedly conducting illegal fishing operations; two Chinese Marine Surveillance ships, namely Zhonggou Haijian 75 and Zhonggou Haijian 84 were deployed in response, leading to a standoff.[20][21][22] Gregorio del Pilar left the area on 12 April 2012, having been relieved by the Philippine Coast Guard ship BRPPampanga(SARV-003).[23] Filipino-American community in Hawaii greeting the Gregorio del Pilar as it arrives in Hawaii on 27 July 2011.
