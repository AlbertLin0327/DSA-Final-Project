Patayin sa Sindak si Barbara (lit. means Kill Barbara in Shock) is a 1995 Filipino horror-drama remake of the 1974 horror film Patayin Mo Sa Sindak Si Barbara. Directed by Chito S. Roo and released by Star Cinema. The film also celebrated the 20th year anniversary offering in which the film was originally released. Being the loving older sister, Barbara (Lorna Tolentino) has always been overly indulgent of her little sister Ruth's every whim. Years later, Barbara meets and instantly falls in love with Nick (Tonton Gutierrez), who is mutually smitten with her. But the spoiled Ruth (Dawn Zulueta) confesses to her older sister that she too is in love with Nick and threatens to kill herself if he does not marry her. So with a heavy heart, Barbara once again passively accommodates Ruth's demands and convinces Nick to court her younger sister instead. In a twisted act of devotion, Nick reluctantly agrees to marry Ruth, to prove his love for Barbara. After the wedding, Barbara then decides to start a new life abroad, to give Nick a chance to truly fall in love with Ruth and for Barbara to get over her feelings for him. Her past comes back to haunt her (in more ways than one) when Barbara receives news that her younger sister has killed herself and was witnessed by Ruth's only daughter Karen (Antoinette Taus). Barbara immediately returns to the Philippines to mourn her sister and comfort her unstable niece. But strange events happen upon Barbara's return and she learns the reason surrounding Ruth's mysterious death. Throughout their marriage, Ruth felt that Nick never really loved her, but instead still harboured feelings for her sister. In a state of paranoid delusion, she suspects that Nick was having an affair and used his business trips to the States as an excuse to rendezvous with Barbara. In a jealous rage, she commits suicide and haunts the household through a doll to extract revenge on everyone who wronged her. The majority of the visual effects used in the film were handled by Cinevideo Arts Philippines. Digital compositing were handled by Video Post.
