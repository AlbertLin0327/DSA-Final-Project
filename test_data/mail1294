RX Plastics Ltd is New Zealand company specialising mostly in plastic products for water transport or storage. The company was established in 1972 in Ashburton, New Zealand and now has distribution centres in North America, Australia, South America and South Africa. RX Plastics designs and manufactures the K-Line Irrigation product range, parts of which are patented in New Zealand, Australia, USA, South Africa and Canada.[1] RX Plastics patented K-Line technology is a unique system designed for irrigation. The system uses flexible tubing line and a pod sprinkler system.[2] The core of the system is a series of durable pods that protect a sprinkler. The sprinkler is attached to a resilient but flexible polyethylene pipe. RX Plastics received a grant from Trade and Industry NZ which they used to develop their Airtech 9000 Wastewater Treatment system. This system is designed to be earthquake proof because the septic tank systems are designed to move in the soil without breaking during an earthquake.[3] Following the Christchurch earthquakes in September 2010 and February 2011, RX Plastics products played an important role in the progress of the citys rebuild. The companys PVC and PE pipes were used in the rebuild of the citys waste water, storm water and drinking water infrastructure. They also saw an increased demand for water tanks which have been used for water storage in Christchurchs most affected areas as well as domestically.[4]
