At the Badalona Museum, opened in 1966, one can visit the remains of the Roman city of Baetulo underneath the building, where there are baths, part of a road and a group of shops. In 2010, the decumanus site, with remains from the Cardo Maximus and the Decumanus Maximus, diverse shops or tavernae and three insula, became part of the visit, along with the permanent exhibition which describes the first settlements recorded in Badalona (prehistory, the Iron Age and Iberian culture) and the history and characteristics of Roman Baetulo, with very noteworthy pieces (the hinges, the Venus of Badalona, the Tabula hospitalis, the ceramic vessel Vas de les Naus, the portrait of Agripina and three Iberian steles). The Museum also has a collection rich in archaeological materials from the excavations it carries out, and also conserves a great variety of objects from other eras (of art, everyday life, crafts, industry, etc.), which give testimony to the history of the city.[1]
