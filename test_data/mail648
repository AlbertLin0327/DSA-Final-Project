Thereafter he was the U.S. Minister to Mexico (18731880), to Russia (18801881) and to Spain (18831885). In the Benjamin Harrison Administration he served as a State Department "trouble shooter" before replacing James G. Blaine who had succumbed to what became a fatal attack of Bright's Disease. He served as U.S. Secretary of State under President Benjamin Harrison in 1892 and 1893.
