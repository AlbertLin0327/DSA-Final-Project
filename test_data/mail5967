Maximum Shame is a feature-length dystopian movie, written and directed by Carlos Atanes and released in 2010. The end of the world is imminent. A man goes into a parallel dimension, a limbo between reality and fantasy where the normal rules of time and space have ceased to apply.[1] His wife goes to rescue him.[2] Both will be trapped in a strange and cruel world where a ruthless Queen organizes reality as a mad game of chess, a post-apocalyptic dystopia of domination and subjugation where characters cant eat, speak or move about freely and are periodically viciously attacked.[3] "Maximum Shame" is the third feature movie by Carlos Atanes. It can be framed as the previous ones -"FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions" and "PROXIMA"- within the fantasy genre, but "Maximum Shame" overflows this classification, being in fact an experimental cross-genre film, ranging from science fiction to musical through horror, surrealism and fetish, and touches on topics as diverse as chess, parallel universes, pornography, religious ecstasy, totalitarianism and black holes.[4] Produced completely independently, like all its author's films, it inspired aesthetics in pornographic and 70's films. Thereby recovering the underground, transgressive and weird style that characterized Atanes' early work.[5] Shooting, in English, was developed in Spain over just six days, but one scene was made in the UK with British scream queen Eleanor James.[6]
