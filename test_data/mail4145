Kingsbridge Road is a rehabilitated local station on the elevated IRT Jerome Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Kingsbridge Road and Jerome Avenue in the Bronx, it is served by the 4 train at all times. It is a typical IRT elevated station, except for an extra exit on the southbound side. The Kingsbridge Armory rises immediately to the west of the station. The station has three tracks and two side platforms. The middle track is generally not used in revenue service.
