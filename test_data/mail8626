'Polygamy is illegal in Uzbekistan (punishable by up to three years imprisonment) and the nation does not provide for polygamous marriages under civil law or customary law.[1] Despite such illegalities, there have been recent debates about the legislation of polygamous marriages under civil law;[2] though such measure have always failed to pass.
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
