Amazing Agent Luna is an original English-language manga series written by Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir (also authors of Destiny's Hand), with art by Shiei. It is published by Seven Seas Entertainment. The first volume of Amazing Agent Luna was one of Seven Seas Entertainment's four initial releases. In July 2005 Amazing Agent Luna became the first of Seven Seas Entertainment's titles to have its second volume released. It is Seven Seas Entertainment's best-selling OEL manga.[1] Seven Seas has announced two new volumes of Amazing Agent Luna will be released in 2010[dated info], as well as a spin-off series, Amazing Agent Jennifer, which will focus on Jennifer Kajiwara, Luna's biological mother. The story follows Luna, a genetically bred super-spy created by the US government. At age 16, Luna is given her toughest assignment yet: after being raised in isolation and only trained as a spy, she must now pose as a normal high school girl. Since she never knew real parents or friends, things quickly become very confusing for her. She makes friends with Oliver, a skater with a crush on her; and Francesca, a nice girl who used to be friends with Luna's rival. But she also has to deal with the emotions and events many teenagers face. To make matters much harder on Luna, the boy she develops a crush on, Jonah, is the son of her main enemy, Count Von Brucken.
