Johann Justin Preissler (16981771) was a 19th century German painter and draughtsman. Preissler was born and died in Nuremberg. According to the RKD he was the son and pupil of Johann Daniel Preissler and the brother of Georg Martin.[1] Like his father before him, he took a grand tour as a young man and travelled extensively in Italy (Venice, Florence Rome Naples).[1] On his return he married the glasspainter Susanna Maria Dorsch (1738). He became director of the Nuremberg Academy (founded by his father) in 1742, and in 1752 he became director of the drawing academy.[1] His copies of the ceiling pieces by Rubens and Van Dyck in the Carolus Borromeuskerk were published by his brother Georg Martin in 1735. They form an historic record of those paintings, as lightning struck the church in 1718 and caused a fire which caused the roof to collapse. The Teylers Museum in Haarlem has a copy of this book as well as other works by Preissler.
