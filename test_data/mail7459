The bouklos rule is a phonological rule of the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE). It states that a labiovelar stop (*k *g *g) dissimilates to an ordinary velar stop (*k *g *g) next to the vowel *u or its corresponding glide *w. The rule is named after an example, the Ancient Greek word  (bouklos) "cowherd", from PIE *gou-kolos < *gou-kolos. That the second constituent of this word was originally *-kolos can be seen from the analogously constructed  (aiplos) "goatherd" < *ai()-kolos.[1] The same dissimilated form *gou-kolos is the ancestor of Proto-Celtic *bou-koli-, the source of Welsh bugail (which would have had -b- rather than -g- if it had come from a form with *-k-).[2] Another example could be the Greek negation [] (ouk[]), which Warren Cowgill has interpreted as coming from pre-Greek *ojukid < *(ne) oju kid, meaning approximately "not on your life". Without the bouklos rule, the result would have been **[] (out[]).[3] The rule is also found in Germanic, mainly in verbs, where labiovelars are delabialised by the epenthetic -u- inserted before syllabic resonants:
