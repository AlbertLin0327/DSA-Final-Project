The Sune series is a series of childrens/youth books by Swedish writers Anders Jacobsson and Sren Olsson. The books have been published since 1984. The Sune books are set in fictional town of Glimmerdagg in Sweden, which just like Berts hometown reskoga is located somehwere between Karlskoga-rebro. There is Sderskolan, for the grades 1-6. The Sune books are told in the third person perspective and using the present tense, while Bert is told as a first person narrative. Sune Andersson is a Swedish schoolboy, living in a two two-storey single family house with his father Rudolf, his mother Karin, his big sister Anna and his little brother Hkan "Brkan", and the third book, Sjlvklart, Sune, also sees the birth of his little sister Isabelle. His complete name is Karl Sune Rudolf Andersson. Rudolf works in an occie, Karin in a library. Just like Bert, Sune is interested in girls, and Sune also refers to himself as a "girl charmer" (in Swedish: "tjejtjusare"). His girlfriend and childhood friend is Sophie Blixt, but Sune even shows the interest for other girls, as long as they aren't evil. Back in 1983 Anders Jacobsson worked at a school in Karlskoga. Not much has happened since he attended the 1st grade. Once day Anders heard local radio wanting a radio program allowed to be about everything, just it had local connection. Anders wrote an episode about Sune, recorded it in his own studio, sending it to SR rebro. The episode became popular, and the radio asked for an entire Sune series in the rebro local radio. Anders wrote more episode, and soon angry listeners from the entire district called demanding to hear the continutation of "Sagan om Sune" (the "Fairytale About Sune"). Soon, Sune could be heard al across the districts. Several people were listening to Sune, both in the workplace and at home. Sune was a 7 year old boy in the 1st grade. His friend was Joakim Frberg. Sune was not the "tough guy" who used to fight or play soccer. Instead, he was more interested into girls. Local book publishing company "Hegas" contacted Anders Jacobsson asking to publish the book. Sren Olsson illustrated the book boken "Sagan om Sune", published in time for Christmas 1984. The second book was, "Sune brjar tvan" ("Sune Starts the Second Grade") from 1985, where Sren Olsson also begun writing. The 3rd book, "Sjlvklart, Sune" ("Of Course, Sune"), was released in 1986 crediting them both as writers. The book "Sune och Svarta Mannen" ("Sune and the Black Man"), was released in 1989 and was thought to complete the Sune series, giving space for the two year old Bert series. But instead, both series continued leaping parallel. Two television Christmas calendars are based on the Sune books: Sunes jul from 1991 and Hkan Brkan from 2003. In 1998, Familjen Anderssons sjuka jul was the radio calendar. A feature film opened in 1993, based on the book Sunes sommar, and the film Hkan Brkan & Josef opened in 2004. The animated television Series consists of a 9 year old Sune. Sophie acts more like a tomboy, and Sune doesn't seem to have fallen in love with her. They have a friend, Herman, an intelligent but more silent guy. Andersson family: Blixt family: Sune's classmates: Other characters:
