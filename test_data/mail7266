The Htea River is a river of New Zealand. It flows from the north-east of Whangarei southwards and into the northern head of Whangarei Harbour.[1] Its lower length forms the eastern boundary of the city. The banks along the lower reaches are parks and bushland[2] with a series of metalled walks suitable for all weathers.[3] At Whangarei Falls near Tikipunga, the Htea River drops 26 metres (85ft) over a basalt lava flow. The falls, originally known as Otuihau, have been a picnic spot since at least the 1890s.[4] The spelling of the river's name was amended from Hatea to Htea by the New Zealand Geographic Board in 2007.[5] Coordinates: 354320S 1741926E / 35.72222S 174.32389E / -35.72222; 174.32389
