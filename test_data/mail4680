The Faces I've Been is a posthumous double album by Jim Croce, released in 1975. The album was designed to show Croce's artistic development. The tracklisting is chronological and the liner notes describe each period of Croce's career. Side one includes "1961-64 The Spires" and "1964-67 Facets." The Spires are a folk singing group affiliated with the Villanova Singers. The first two tracks are from an album released by Villanova and the third is a live concert recording from the period. The remaining four tracks on side one are from an album Croce recorded in 1966 entitled Facets. Sides two and three include the periods "1967-70" and "After 1970", respectively. Side four includes "The Raps", or Croce's storytelling in a live setting. Additional examples of this storytelling can be found on his other live releases. The album title comes from a line from Croce's song "The Hard Way Every Time".
