Johann was last Count of Cleves, from 1347 through 1368. Upon his death in 1368, the counties of Cleves and Count of Mark were united. Johann was the youngest son of Dietrich VII, Count of Cleves and his second wife Margaret of Habsburg. He succeeded in 1347 his brother Dietrich VIII, Count of Cleves who had died without sons. He married Mechteld of Guelders (-1384), daughter of Duke Reginald II, Duke of Guelders, but the marriage remained childless. After his death, the County of Cleves went to Adolf III of the Marck and so to the Counts of Marck. The County of Cleves (German: Grafschaft Kleve; Dutch: Graafschap Kleef) was a comital polity of the Holy Roman Empire in present Germany (part of North Rhine-Westphalia) and the Netherlands (parts of Limburg, Noord-Brabant and Gelderland). Its rulers, called counts, had a special and privileged standing in the Empire. The County of Cleves was first mentioned in the 11th century. In 1417, the county became a duchy (German: Herzogtum Kleve; Dutch: Hertogdom Kleef) and its rulers were raised to the status of Dukes. Its history is closely related to that of its neighbours: the Duchies of Jlich, Berg and Guelders and the County of Mark. In 1521 Jlich, Berg, Cleves and Mark formed the United Duchies of Jlich-Cleves-Berg. The territory was situated on both sides of the river Rhine, around its capital Cleves and roughly covering today's districts of Cleves, Wesel and the city of Duisburg.
