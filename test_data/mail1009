The Miss Asian America Pageant is a nationwide pageant founded in 1980 by Rose Chung with a mission "to showcase young Asian American women in a high quality production that will represent their culture, intelligence and talent." Incorporated as Miss Asian, Inc. in 1980, the pageant grew from the success of the Miss Asian California pageant and the Rose Ball Queen pageants, both events based in California and was first held as an event part of the Asian American Arts Festival of 1985. Since 1985, over 500 contestants have competed in the pageant.
