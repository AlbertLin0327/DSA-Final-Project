Trencrom Hill (or Trecrobben) is a prominent hill fort, owned by the National Trust, near Lelant, Cornwall. It is crowned by an univallate Neolithic tor enclosure and was re-used as a hillfort in the Iron Age. Cairns or hut circles can be seen in the level area enclosed by the stone and earth banks.[1] The hill overlooks the Hayle Estuary and river, and Mount's Bay and St. Michaels Mount can be seen to the south.[2] Trink lies one kilometre to the North West. Trecobben, the giant of Trencrom, was supposed to have killed Cormelian (wife of Cormoran) by throwing a hammer across to St Michael's Mount. This is possibly a well constructed to service the inhabitants of the camp. Coordinates: 501025N 52839W / 50.1736N 5.4776W / 50.1736; -5.4776
