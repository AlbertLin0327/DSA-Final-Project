NCAA Football 2004 is an American football video game released in 2003 by Tiburon. The player on the cover is former USC quarterback and current Oakland Raiders quarterback Carson Palmer. The game is available for play with the N-Gage. Commentators are Brad Nessler, Kirk Herbstreit and Lee Corso. Gameplay was similar to NCAA Football 2003, but with updated player stats and rosters.
