"Distant Origin" is the 65th episode of Star Trek: Voyager, the 23rd episode of the third season. Professor Gegen and his assistant, Veer, two palaeontologists of the space-faring Voth species, discover the skeletal human remains of a member of Voyager's crew, though they are unaware of its origins. Instead, they are fascinated by the similarity of its genome to their own species, and Gegen suggests that this supports the highly controversial Distant Origin theory, that the Voth had originated on a far-distant planet instead of the current area of space from which they rule their galactic empire. Proving the Distant Origin theory has been sought by other Voth scientists but has often led to their exile. To confirm their proof, Gegen and Veer track down the original of the skeleton, learning of Voyager's presence in the Delta Quadrant. They locate the ship and transport aboard while cloaked, observing the mostly human crew in the setting. Voyager's sensors detect their presence, and the crew reveals the Voths. Veer responds instinctively by releasing sedative-tipped needles that strike Chakotay; Geger grabs the human and transports him aboard his ship, fleeing from Voyager. The Doctor examines Veer and identifies the similar genetic structure; he and Captain Janeway use simulations to determine that the Voths descended from the hadrosaurs, probably of genus Parasaurolophus. Gegen wakes Chakotay, and explains the situation, requesting Chakotay accompany him when he presents his evidence to the Voth elders. Despite the evidence, Gegen is put on trial for heresy, and the Voth capture Voyager, threatening to destroy the humans aboard to remove Gegen's evidence. Veer, recovered from Voyager, is coerced to act as a witness against Gegen by Minister Odala. Chakotay attempts to argue for Gegen, noting that the Voth theory of origins has changed so much to fit what the Voth wish to believe and not reality. Odala rejects this, and offers Gegen the choice to abandon the Distant Origin theory, or otherwise he and the crew of Voyager will be condemned to a prison colony. With no choice, Gegen recants his theory. Odala assigns Gegen to a new ministry to study in, and then orders Voyager to leave Voth space forever. Before departing, Chakotay gives Gegen a globe of the Earth, which Gegen acknowledges that someday, the Voth will accept as their homeworld.
