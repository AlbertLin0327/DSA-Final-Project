Zencoder is a cloud-based video encoding service launched in 2010. Zencoder offers video transcoding, ingest, and syndication via web service APIs. According to numbers available in December 2011[1], Zencoder is the largest cloud-based video encoding service in the market. Zencoder is backed by leading investors, including five of the top ten angel investors in the US according to Business Week[2]. Investors include Y Combinator, Chris Sacca, Dave McClure, Ron Conway, Founders Collective, Andreessen-Horowitz, and Ignition Partners. In 2008, Zencoder partnered with On2 Technologies to create Flix Cloud, an online video encoding service. [3] Flix Cloud officially launched in April of 2009. Google[4] acquired On2 in 2010, and Flix Cloud was shut down later that year. Zencoder launched as a new transcoding service in May of 2010 after the company participated in the Y Combinator startup accelerator. In 2011, CloudHarmony benchmarked the transcoding speeds of four cloud encoding platforms, including Zencoder.[5] In these benchmarks, Zencoder provided the fastest average encoding speeds in all 8 tests. Zencoder is the creator of an open-source HTML5 video player, Video.js, built with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Video.js plays video via native playback in all HTML5 browsers and devices, or with Flash when HTML5 playback is not available.
