Karl Knorre (March 28, 1801  August 29, 1883) was a Russian astronomer of German ethnic origin. Karl Knorre was born into a three-generation astronomer family. His father, Ernst Friedrich Knorre (17591810),[1] had moved from Germany to Dorpat (now Tartu, Estonia) where he worked (180310) as Observator for the Dorpat observatory (opened in 1802) and professor of Mathematics at the University of Dorpat. Karl Friedrich Knorre (18011883),[1] set up and was director of the Nikolayev Astronomical Observatory starting in 1827.[2][3][4] [5][6] When Karl Knorre was 9 years old, his father died. He moved with his mother to his uncle Karl August Senff. Karl Knorre was teaching other pupils in mathematics and Latin to earn money for his one education. He was a very clever pupil. At the age of 15 entered the Dorpart University. His unkle want that he studied theology. Nevertheless Karl attend at some lectures of astronomy, but a lot of his knowledge he studied by self-education. He had a well-wisher, Wilhelm Struve, professor of astronomy. When Karl was 19 years old there was a request for a leader of a new marine observatory at Nikolaiev (c. 1700km away from Dorpat). Wilhelm Struve proposes Karl Knorre and he get the Job. Admiral Alexander Greigh was commander in chief of the Back Sea Fleet. He wanted to have the observatory. The challenge for Karl Knorre was to equip the observatory. He asked for a business trip to see the important observatories of Europe. Greig agreed. In those days the travel vas by stagecoach. Tough the duration was more than two years. He visited in Germany Friedrich Bessel, Johann Franz Encke, Heinrich Christian Schumacher at Altona; in Paris, France, he visited Franois Arago; as well he visited Greenwich and Dublin. He also looked for manufacturers of good chronographs. Back home he discussed with admiral Greigh his impressiones and ordered the equipment for the observatory. In his equipment there was a mercuric artificial horizon mirror. To exclude measurement failures it was possible to look with the telescope direct to the stars or indirect via the mercurial mirror. He had during his life a lot of correspondence with peoples he visited during his long journey. Also he was member of the Royal Astronomical Society. His son Viktor was bornthe fifth one of fifteen childrenin Nikolayev (now Mykolayiv, Ukraine). He moved to Berlin in 1862 to study astronomy. When Karl Knorre retired he moved to his son Viktor.
