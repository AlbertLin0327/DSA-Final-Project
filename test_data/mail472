2CFV, 2DLE, 2NZ6 Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase eta is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the PTPRJ gene.[1][2][3] The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This PTP possesses an extracellular region containing five fibronectin type III repeats, a single transmembrane region, and a single intracytoplasmic catalytic domain, and thus represents a receptor-type PTP. This PTP is present in all hematopoietic lineages, and was shown to negatively regulate T cell receptor signaling possibly through interfering with the phosphorylation of Phospholipase C Gamma 1 (PLCG1) and Linker for Activation of T Cells (LAT). This PTP was also found to dephosphorylate PDGF beta receptor, and may be involved in UV-induced signal transduction.[3] PTPRJ has been shown to interact with CTNND1.[4] Receptor type PTPs (PTPRA, PTPRB, PTPRC, PTPRD, PTPRE, PTPRF, PTPRG, PTPRH, PTPRJ, PTPRK, PTPRM, PTPRN, PTPRN2, PTPRO, PTPRQ, PTPRR, PTPRS, PTPRT, PTPRU, PTPRZ1, PTPRZ2) MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) (DUSP1, DUSP2, DUSP4, DUSP5, DUSP6, DUSP7, DUSP8, DUSP9, DUSP10, DUSP16, MK-STYX) Slingshots (SSH1, SSH2, SSH3) PRLs (PTP4A1, PTP4A2, PTP4A3) CDC14s (CDC14A, CDC14B, CDKN3, PTP9Q22) Atypical DSPs (DUSP3, DUSP11, DUSP12, DUSP13A, DUSP13B, DUSP14, DUSP15, DUSP18, DUSP19, DUSP21, DUSP22, DUSP23, DUSP24, DUSP25, DUSP26, DUSP27, EMP2A, RNGTT, STYX) Phosphatase and tensin homologs (PTENs) (PTEN, TPIP, TPTE, TNS, TENC1)
