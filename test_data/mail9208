Queer Tango is a new way to dance Argentine tango free from traditional heteronormative codes. Its proposal is to dance tango without pre-established roles according to the gender of the dancers and to perform the exchange of leader and follower. Therefore it is related to open role or same-sex tango. The queer tango movement permits not only an access to tango for the LGBT community, but also supports existing possibilities for heterosexual dancers  women learn the lead, men learn the follow. Studying both roles, women and men enhance their communication and sensitivity. Conventional tango is said to be the stronghold of heterosexism and machismo: Dancing in very close embrace  this intimacy is what defines tango as a "three-minute love affair" [2] -, the male dance partner is the lead and the female dance partner is the follow. These two gender roles are sexually defined: Traditional tango is steeped in machismo culture. It is a reflection of Argentine societal views on sexuality and gender relations. The man is the active participant while the woman is passive. Argentine tango is a full improvisational dance. The male leader moves forward, guides the step pattern, the tempo and protects the female follower who steps backwards in complete trust, her eyes might be closed. She adds expressive elements to the dance: adornos (embellishments). The man, choreographer, creates the structure of the dance, and his purpose is to make the woman appear pretty. The lady must wait for the man to guide the movement and with a bad leader, shes lost. At conventional milongas its the man who invites the woman to dance with eye-contact and a nod of the head, called cabeceo.[4] The Queer Tango movement breaks these rigid heteronormative gender roles of the tango world and permits all the permutations of partnering within tango. Same-sex tangoing is frequent: men dance with men[5], women dance with women, who can lead or follow. Also men dance with women, exploring open role reverse. The term queer, commonly used as a synonym for the LGBT community, is used here in a larger sense. A queer tango dancer shifts the focus from sexuality to gender which allows to enhance his expressiveness by way of role exchange. Therefore the Queer Tango scene gives not only a home to gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex tangueras and tangueros (tango dancers), where they can feel comfortable. It creates a liberated tango environment for gender-neutral dancing, where rules and codes of traditional tango no longer restrain communication between people. By way of queer tango teaching, heterosexuals dancers can learn the open role reverse and enhance their competences in tango: There is one clich pretending that tango as a dance was born in the brothels of Buenos Aires, another clich relates that tango was created by men dancing tango between men on street corners at the beginning of the 20th century: In the first decade of the 20th century, tango became famous as a couple dance (man-woman) in Paris.[8] There are also French and American postcards [9] from the first decades of the 20th century which represent tango between women. This feminine replica of man-to-man-tango generated much less literary documentation, yet a more extensive iconography tinged with a voyeuristic accent of eroticism: This popularity of Tango in Europe, and especially in Paris, made it an interesting couple dance (man-woman) for the upper classes in Buenos Aires, and the Tango was re-imported from Europe for their benefit.[8] The original way to dance it in same-sex couples got lost and was forbidden. Only male-female couples were allowed to dance in public milongas. The Queer tango movement which revives the origins of tango as a same-sex couple dance is very recent. It was founded in Germany, in Hamburg, where in 2001 the first gay-lesbian milonga was organized.[10] In the same year the First International Queer Tango Argentina Festival was brought there to life. Since 2001 it takes place every year in order to bring together same sex couples in tango from all over the world. Born in Germany, the Queer Tango movement inspired other countries to create local queer tango scenes. Meanwhile Queer Tango festivals are celebrated for example in Argentina[11], in Denmark [12], Sweden[13] and in the United States [14] In the bastion of traditional heteronormative tango, in Buenos Aires, the first Queer Milonga, La Marshall, home for the LGBT tango community, opened its doors in 2002.[15]
