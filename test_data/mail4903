En Vivo en Buenos Aires (Spanish for Live in Buenos Aires) Released in 1994 is the ninth album and first live one from the Argentine Ska Reggae Latin Rock band Los Fabulosos Cadillacs. It was well received and earned a gold disc[1]. Recorded in the Arena Obras Sanitarias following the huge success of Vasos Vacios. The album shows a young Cadillacs which put a lot of strength in the songs, mixing them with parts of other songs (like "Desapariciones" that is mixed with "Rio Manzanares" both of Ruben Blades) or with Vicentico putting strong vocal parts in a few songs like "Siguiendo la Luna".
