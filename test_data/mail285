Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo is the fourth studio album released by the American Skate punk/punk rock band MxPx in 1998. The album title was taken from a letter that a fan had written to the band, complaining that the band was changing, and, "Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo." The band addresses this on their DVD, B-Movie. It ranked at #99 on the Billboard 200 and went gold on January 27, 2000.[4] All songs written and composed by Mike Herrera, and arranged by MxPx.
