In 1992, Bowler was asked to join Motrhead to replace drummer Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor, after working on some material for the March r Die album. Bowler got to know Wrzel when Mournblade supported Motrhead in 1989. In December 1991, Bowler received a call from Wrzel to join him at a rehearsal session in London with Phil Campbell. Bowler used Phil Taylor's drum kit and they worked on two or three ideas and recorded them for Lemmy, who was in LA. One of the demos became the track "Stand" from Motrhead's 1992 "March r Die" album.[9] In the event Mikkey Dee played on a couple of the album tracks and joined the band. Bowler is a constant live performer (UK and International) as well as a recording artiste, recording material for TV and Radio such as Bob Harris's opening jingle (Radio 2) and music for Ewan McGregor & Charley Boorman's Long Way Round which included music from the highly acclaimed "The Pendell Guitar Project"[15][16][17] with Stephen Loveday.
