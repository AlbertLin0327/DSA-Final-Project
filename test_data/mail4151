Sverre Fehn (August 14, 1924  February 23, 2009) was a Norwegian architect. The architects highest international honour came in 1997, when he was awarded both the Pritzker Architecture Prize and the Heinrich Tessenow Gold Medal.[1] Fehn was born in Kongsberg, Buskerud.[2] He received his architectural education shortly after World War II in Oslo, a crisis course that would later become an independent school under various names during the next decades, today known as the Oslo School of Architecture and Design. He quickly became the leading Norwegian architect of his generation. In 19521953, during travels in Morocco, he discovered vernacular architecture, which was to deeply influence his future work. Later he moved to Paris, where he worked for two years in the studio of Jean Prouv, and where he knew Le Corbusier. On his return to Norway, in 1954, he opened a studio of his own. At the age of 34 Fehn gained international recognition for his design of the Norwegian Pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition.[2] In the 1960s he produced two works that have remained highlights in his career: the Nordic Pavilion at the Venice Biennale (1962) and the Hedmark Museum in Hamar, Norway (196779). Fehn's other notable works include Schreiner House in Oslo (1963) and Busk House at Bamble (1990); however, few of his projects were effectively built. He taught in Oslo's School of Architecture from 1971-1995[2] as a professor and principal from 19861989, as well as at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Fehn designed over 100 buildings,[3] however by the time he received the Pritzker in 1997 only 11 have been built.[2] Some of the most notable are: Norwegian Glacier Museum in Fjrland Hedmark Museum, Hamar, Norway Aukrust Centre in Alvdal National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design
