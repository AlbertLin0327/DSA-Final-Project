The Withers Stakes is an American Thoroughbred horse race for three-year-olds willing to compete one mile on the dirt. Held at Aqueduct Racetrack every year at the end of April (one week before the Kentucky Derby), it is a Grade III event, and offers a purse of $150,000. While it was once a prep for the Kentucky Derby, today horses never run back so quickly and it has declined in prestige and importance. In 1956, the Withers Stakes was contested at a mile and a sixteenth. The Withers was named for David Dunham Withers (18211892), an important owner/breeder who won this race in 1890 with his colt, King Eric. The inaugural run of the Withers Stakes occurred in 1874 at Jerome Park Racetrack. It was raced there through 1889 after which it was hosted by the Morris Park Racecourse from 1890 through 1904, then Jamaica Racetrack in 1956, and at Belmont Park from 1957 through 1959 and 1984 through 1996. The Withers was not run in 1911 and 1912 due to a New York State legislated ban on all forms of wagering on horses. It was also not run in 2011, but it scheduled to return to the New York racing calendar on February 4, 2012. Speed record: Most wins by a jockey: Most wins by a trainer: Most wins by an owner: *  In 1969, Gleaming Light finished first, but was disqualified and set back to fifth.
