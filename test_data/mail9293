The National Belizean Alliance is a group of third parties contesting the 2008 general elections in Belize. The NBA was formed in October 2007 in Belize City between the We the People Reform Movement (WTP), People's National Party (PNP), and a group from Cayo called Christians Pursuing Reform. Since then it has released several statements criticizing the ruling People's United Party (PUP).
