Hans Peter Nordstrm (born July 26, 1974 in Munkfors, Vrmland County, Sweden) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey player. He played his last seasons for Leksands IF. Nordstrm started his professional ice hockey career in the Swedish elite club Leksands IF in 1994. But after only one year he left Leksand IF and signed with its rivals Frjestads BK. Nordstrm played with Frjetad until 1998, winning the Swedish Championship in both 1997 and 1998. Then he was drafted by the Boston Bruins in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft (3rd round, 78th pick overall). And in the fall of 1998 he signed with the Bruins. But after the training camp he became assigned to the AHL club Providence Bruins. After only playing 13 games with Providence and two games with Boston Nordstrm went back home to Sweden and Frjestad and playing the rest of the 1998-99 season there. And currently he is still a member of Frjestads BK and his now playing his elventh season with them. In 2002, he won his third Swedish Championship with Frjestad.
