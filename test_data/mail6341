Vertiginous epilepsy is infrequently the first symptoms of a seizure. When it occurs there is a movement sensation that lasts for a few seconds before full seizure activity. The movement activity is either of the body moving away from the side of the brain lesion or of the environment in the opposite direction.[1] 
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
