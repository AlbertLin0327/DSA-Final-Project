Iranians in Israel refers to the community of Iranian Jews living in Israel. Many of them immigrated to Israel after the Iranian revolution in 1979.[2] Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, over 40,000 Iranian Jews have settled in Israel.[3] Kol Israel transmits daily radio broadcasts to Iran in the Persian language and Menashe Amir, an Iranian Jew, hosts a talk show that draws callers from Iran.
