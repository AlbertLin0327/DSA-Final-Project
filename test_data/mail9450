Clascal was an object-oriented programming language developed in 1983 by the Personal Office Systems (POS) division (later renamed The Lisa Division, still later The 32-Bit Systems Division) of Apple Computer. It was an extension of Lisa Pascal, which in turn harked back to the UCSD Pascal model originally implemented on the Apple II. It was strongly influenced by Xerox PARC's release of Smalltalk-80, v1 (which had been ported to the Lisa previously), and also by Modula. Clascal was the inspiration for Object Pascal on the Macintosh in 1985. With the demise of the Lisa in 1986, Pascal and Object Pascal continued to be used in the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop for systems and application development for several more years, until it was finally supplanted by the C and C++ programming languages. The MacApp application template was based on sample programs originally written in Clascal, and on the "Toolkit", or class library. Ultimately Object Pascal evolved into the programming language of Borland Delphi.
