The EP is one in a series of six picture discs put together by the collaboration of artist David Horvitz and six bands: Sunset Rubdown, Casiotone for the Painfully Alone, Parenthetical Girls, No Age, Mika Miko, and Abe Vigoda.[2] The singles are a collaborative effort insomuch that the music is contributed by the bands, and the photography is contributed by Horvitz.
