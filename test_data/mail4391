Rick Chase (born George T. Fryer on June 12, 1957 in Salinas, California, died December 12, 2002 in Stockton) was a disc jockey known primarily for his 13 years on San Francisco radio station KMEL 106.1 FM. Chase was a disk jockey and program host with San Francisco based KMEL from 1986 to 1999. Know for bits such as Dinner Across America, Vaughn Richards, being a leader in listener interaction, and creating future radio stars. Best DJ in California ever.[citation needed] In May 1991, Chase, KMEL, and KMEL's parent company, Century Broadcasting, were sued over a charge of assault and battery stemming from a "legs contest" held at "Jam Zone" the previous June in Daly City. The plaintiff in the suit alleged she had been physically pushed by Chase from a stage where she was performing. KMEL program director Keith Naftaly countered that the plaintiff, Sharon Ferguson, was beginning a striptease, a violation of the rules.[1] In January 1993, the Federal Communications Commission upheld a $25,000 fine levied against Century Broadcasting for material presented on Chase's "The Rick Chase Show." Broadcast between August 20 and September 16, 1991, the segment of Chase's show was called "Dinner Across America" and had Chase calling people to ask them "what was the last thing you had in your mouth?" Chase replied to the fine, saying "It seems the right of free speech doesn't apply to radio." "I only considered it entertainment," he said.[2] Chase emceed a July 13, 1999 "motivational assembly" at Washington High School in San Francisco. The event was sponsored by Mario Murillo, a Danville Christian preacher, and featured a religious message. The religious nature of the event was in violation of the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and as such the school superintendent said the group would not be permitted to return.[3] On December 12, 2002, Chase was found dead of a heart attack in this Stockton home. A memorial service was held in his hometown, Salinas, on December 21 at St. George's Episcopal Church.[4]
