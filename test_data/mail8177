Percy Brooke (born 1893 in Kidsgrove) was an English professional football left-back. Brooke's career began with his local side Kidsgrove Wellington, from whom he joined Stoke City, playing 11 times in league matches for Stoke in the 1919-20 and 1920-21 seasons. He left Stoke to join Aberdare Athletic, playing Aberdare's side in their first ever season in league football. He went on to make 123 league appearances for Aberdare before joining Swindon Town in 1926, making his Swindon debut in September 1926 in a 2-1 win at home to A.F.C. Bournemouth. He then dropped out of the side and only returned in April 1927 when he played in a 3-2 home win over his former side Aberdare (one of Aberdare's last games as league side) and a 4-4 draw away to Gillingham.Brooke played twice for Accrington Stanley the following season before leaving league football.[1]
