James "Jim" Burns is a character at HBO drama Oz played by Peter James Kelsch. Prisoner 96B632, Jim Burns. Convicted in 1996 for murdering his brother (although he claims he is innocent, which is semi-supported by the fact his crime is not shown) A background Biker, Jim Burns can be seen in background until season 4, where he is converted by Reverend Jeremiah Cloutier. When Jaz Hoyt is convicted, Burns is chosen as his sponsor and cellmate at Emerald City. Burns supported Steve Pasquin during the boxing matches. During Martin Querns and Simon Adebisi's racist reign, white inmates were transferred out of Emerald City. The Bikers Hoyt, Sands, Jarvis, Simpson and Burns were with them. With the death of Adebisi and the end of Querns's reign, Burns and the Bikers were transferred back to Emerald City. Reverend Jeremiah Cloutier was convicted and started to make sermons. During one, Burns doubt and mocked Cloutier, who exorcisised Burns, who became a Christian. With fellow Christian Timmy Kirk, Burns started to beat those who are not Christians. When Ryan O'Reily decided to help Padraig Connolly to get his trust, Kirk and Burns decided to beat Connolly to convert him. The scene was shown to Cloutier by O'Reily, who banished Kirk from his flock. With the gas explosion at the kitchen, Cloutier was seriously injured. Upon learning that Cloutier is making a fast and remarkable recovery, Hoyt and Kirk start to freak out, especially Hoyt because he was in solitary because he bricked Cloutier inside in the wall and took the blame for everyone else. They then force Burns to kill Cloutier because no one will suspect that it was him. Burns refuses because Cloutier brought him to Jesus. Kirk tells him that if he is not part of the solution, then he is Satan's tool. Hoyt then tells Burns to do the deed or die. During lights out, Burns sees Cloutier in his pod. Cloutier tells him that what Hoyt and Kirk are asking him to do is wrong. Instead, Cloutier tells Burns to kill Hoyt and Kirk instead. The next day in the gym Burns tells Kirk and Hoyt that see saw Cloutier in his pod. "For what a blowjob", Kirk jokes as Hoyt laughs. Burns says that Cloutier appeared in his pod and told him that what he is about to do is wrong. Kirk and Hoyt are not convinced, saying that Burns was dreaming and wants to get out of the job, and tells him to kill Clouiter. Holding a bar in his hand, Burns says that Cloutier actually told him that he wants both Jaz and Timmy dead. Burns swings the bar at Kirk, who ducks and knocks Burns down on his knees, which then leads to Hoyt placing a dumbbell around his neck, snapping it, thus causing his death.
