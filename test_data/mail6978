Anusim (Hebrew: , pronounced[anusim]; singular male, Ans, Hebrew:  pronounced[anus]; singular female, Anush, Hebrew:  pronounced[anusa], meaning "Coerced") is a legal category of Jews in halakha (Jewish religious law) who were forced to abandon Judaism against their will, typically while forcibly converted to another religion. The term "anusim" itself is most properly translated as the "coerced [ones]" or the "forced [ones]". The religious legal terms ans/anush/anusim were applied to those Jews who were forced to abandon Judaism against their will, and their children, yet continue to do whatever is in their power to continue practicing Judaism under the forced condition. The terminology derives from the Talmudic phrase "`averah b'ones (Hebrew:  ).",[1] meaning "a forced transgression." The Hebrew term "ones" originally referred to any case where a Jew has been forced into any act against his or her will. The term ans is used in contradistinction to meshumad (), which means a person who has voluntarily abandoned the practice of Jewish Law in whole or part. Besides the term anusim, Halakha has various classifications for those Jews who have abandoned, or are no longer committed to, the rabbinic Jewish tradition, whether or not they have converted to another religion. The two most common descriptions are: The main difference between a min, a meshumad, and the anusim is that the act of abandonment of Judaism is voluntary for a min and a meshumad, while for the anusim it is not. The term anusim became more frequently used after the forced conversion to Christianity of Ashkenazi Jews in Germany at the end of the 11th century. In his religious legal opinions, Rashi, a French rabbi who lived during this period, commented about the issue of anusim. Several centuries later, following the mass forced conversion of Sephardi Jews (those Jews with extended histories in Spain and Portugal, known jointly as Iberia, or "Sepharad" in Hebrew) of the 14th and 15th centuries, the term "anusim" became widely used by Spanish rabbis and their successors for the following 600 years,[2] henceforth becoming associated with Sephardic history. The term, however, is properly applied to any Jew of any Jewish ethnic division, and thus, since then, it has also been used to describe other forced or coerced Jews, such as the Mashadi Jews of Persia (modern Iran), who converted to Islam in the public eye, but secretly practised Judaism at home, to the extent of living a dual-religious life to the fullest, being fully practising Muslims in public life, and fully practising Jews at home.[3] In non-rabbinic literature, the more commonly known Sephardic anusim are also referred to as: The Catholic Church coined the first two terms, the third is more of a modern invention by historians, and the fourth is the insulting term Spanish antisemites gave to the anusim. All four terms are sociological, whereas anusim refers to a status in Jewish law. The subject of anusim has a special place in rabbinic literature. In normal circumstances, a person who abandons Jewish observance, or part of it, is classified as a meshumad. Such a person is still counted as a Jew for purposes of lineage, but is under a disability to claim any privilege pertaining to Jewish status: for example, he should not be counted in a minyan, that is, a quorum for religious services. Anusim, by contrast, not only remain Jews by lineage but continue to count as fully qualified Jews for all purposes. Since the act of their original abandonment was done against the Jews will, the Jew under force may remain a kasher Jew, as long as the ans keeps practising Jewish law to the best of his/her abilities under the coerced condition. In this sense, "kasher" is the rabbinic legal term applied to a Jew who adheres to rabbinic tradition and is accordingly not subject to any disqualification. In regards to Anusim: Hakham Seady ben Maimn ibn Danan, one of the most respected Sephardic Sages after the Expulsion, in the 15th century stated: Hakham BenSin Uziel, the Chief Sephardic Rabbi of the State of Israel, stated in mid-20th c. It follows that Hakham Uziel considered anusm as Jews, because only Jews can give or receive a Get, a Jewish divorce. Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (Maimonides) stated in the Mishneh Torah Sefer Shofetm, Hilekht Mumarm 3:3
