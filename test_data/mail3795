Fisherman's Woman is an album by Emilana Torrini, released in 2005. The songs "Lifesaver", "Sunnyroad" (UK #82)[6] and "Heartstopper" (UK #126)[6] were released as singles. All songs written by Emilana Torrini and Dan Carey unless otherwise noted. The Japanese edition has a bonus disc, which has the same tracks as the single "Heartstopper".
