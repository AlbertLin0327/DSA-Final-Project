Krasnyi Luch (Ukrainian:  ) is a city in the Luhansk Oblast (province) of south-eastern Ukraine. The city is designated as its own separate raion (district) within the oblast. The current estimated population is (in 2005) 89,688 (as of 94,875, in 2001).[1][citation needed]. The town was founded as Krindachyovka at the beginning of the 20th century, and renamed as Krasnyi Luch in 1920. The city became one of the most important coal mining centres of the Donets Basin. On the right is a picture of the Wall of Honor. Such walls were installed in every oblast seat throughout the Soviet Union. With the dissolution of the Soviet state those landmarks were mostly removed, but in some instances were retained as the relics of the past.
