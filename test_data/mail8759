Christopher Burke (born 1967) is an author on typography and a typeface designer. Burke worked at Monotype before earning a PhD in Typography & Graphic Communication at the University of Reading in 1995. "From 1996 to 2001 he taught at the University of Reading, where he planned and conceived the MA in typeface design."[1] He is probably best known for his 1998 book on the typographer Paul Renner. Burke's typefaces include Celeste, Celeste Sans, Parable and Pragma.[2]
