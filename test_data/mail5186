The 26th Dil of Ireland was elected at the 1989 general election on 15 June 1989 and first met on 12 July when the 21st Government of Ireland was appointed. The 26th Dil lasted 1,259 days. The 21st Government of Ireland (12 July 1989  11 February 1992) was formed by the Fianna Fil and Progressive Democrats parties. After the 1989 general election Fianna Fil lost four seats, and Charles Haughey failed to achieve a majority when a vote for Taoiseach was taken in the Dil. 27 days after the election had taken place the coalition government was formed. From January to June 1990 Ireland held the presidency of the European Community. The 1990 Presidential election was held on the 7 November. Mary Robinson won the election, beating the Fianna Fil candidate Brian Lenihan. On the 6 November 1991, Sen Power made a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach, which failed.[1] In early 1992 Sen Doherty, who as Minister for Justice had taken the blame for the phone-tapping scandal of the early 1980s, went on RT and claimed that Haughey had known and authorised it. Haughey denied this but the Progressive Democrats stated that they could no longer continue in government with Haughey as Taoiseach.[2] On 30 January 1992, Haughey resigned as leader of Fianna Fil. He was succeeded by Albert Reynolds who formed the 22nd Government of Ireland. After a challenge by John Wilson in September 1990 Fianna Fil chose Lenihan as the party's candidate. The main opposition party, Fine Gael chose Austin Currie and the Labour Party chose the eventual winner Mary Robinson. Private Acts The 22nd Government of Ireland (11 February 1992  12 January 1993) was formed by the Fianna Fil and Progressive Democrats parties with Albert Reynolds as Taoiseach following the resignation of Charles Haughey. Reynolds formed a controversial cabinet. He dismissed Ray Burke, Mary O'Rourke and Gerry Collins. Renolds promoted critics of Haughey like David Andrews, Samus Brennan, and Charlie McCreevy into senior ministerial positions. Reynolds also promoted a number of younger TDs from rural constituencies like Noel Dempsey and Brian Cowen, to cabinet position. Bertie Ahern remained as Minister for Finance. The 22nd Government had to deal with the X Case. The government took the position that abortion should be illegal except when the life of the mother was in danger. A referendum on abortion was held with the government position being defeated A tribunal of enquiry into irregularities in the beef industry, referred to as the "Beef Tribunal", was established to examine the relationship between the Irish governments and the beef industry. However this revealed to the public a substantial conflict of opinion between the two party leaders. At the tribunal Desmond O'Malley severely criticised Reynolds, in his capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce, for an export credit scheme. When Reynolds gave evidence he referred to O'Malley as "dishonest", the Progressive Democrats voted with a motion of no confidence and the government fell. After the 1992 general election, the 23rd Government of Ireland was formed by a coalition between Fianna Fil and the Labour Party. Private Acts Constitutional Amendments
