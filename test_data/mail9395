Guile Island (6544S 6511W / 65.733S 65.183W / -65.733; -65.183Coordinates: 6544S 6511W / 65.733S 65.183W / -65.733; -65.183) is an island lying 1 nautical mile (2km) southwest of Duchaylard Island, in the Biscoe Islands of Antarctica. It was charted by the British Graham Land Expedition under Rymill, 193437, and so named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1959 because, while there appears to be a number of landing places on this island, numerous underwater rocks make approach dangerous, so requiring guile in the attempt.[1] This article incorporatespublic domain material from the United States Geological Survey document "Guile Island" (content from the Geographic Names Information System).
