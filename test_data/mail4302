Le Dauphin Libr is a provincial daily French newspaper known for its emphasis on local news and events. The paper is produced in 24 different editions covering events in eight French departments, mainly in the region Rhne-Alpes: The print service is in Veurey-Voroize in the agglomeration of Grenoble. Its readership has been unaffected by the decline of newspaper reading in France, unlike most other dailies. Until 2010, the newspaper organised the Critrium du Dauphin Libr, an important race in the lead-up to the Tour de France. The race then became the Critrium du Dauphin.
