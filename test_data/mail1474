The Natural Law Party (NLP) was a transnational party based on the teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.[1] It was active in up to 74 countries, and ran candidates in at least ten. Founded in 1992, it was mostly disbanded in 2004 but continues in India and in some U.S. states. The NLP viewed "natural law" as the organizing principle that governs the universe. The Natural Law Party advocated using the Transcendental Meditation technique and the TM-Sidhi program to reduce or eliminate problems in society. Perhaps the most prominent candidate running on the NLP platform was John Hagelin, who campaigned for U.S. president in 1992, 1996, and 2004. The NLP in the United Kingdom received attention due to the support of former members of The Beatles. The only electoral successes were achieved by the Ajeya Bharat Party in India, which elected a legislator to a state assembly, and by the Croatian NLP, which elected a member of a regional assembly in 1993.[2] The Natural Law Party (NLP) was founded in the U.S. in 1992 by a group of educators, business leaders, and lawyers in Fairfield, Iowa, many of whom practiced the Transcendental Meditation technique.[3] While Natural Law Party leaders denied formal connection with the Transcendental Meditation movement, Bob Roth, a spokesman at the party's headquarters in Fairfield reportedly said, "It's no secret this is the TM party."[4] Among other things, the Natural Law Party proposed to: The Natural Law Party was reportedly active in 74 countries,[5] including affiliates in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and United Kingdom. Delegates from 60 countries attended an international convention of Natural Law Parties held in Bonn Germany in 1998.[6] In addition to national politicians, Benot Frapp of France was the party's candidate for the European Parliament.[7] In 1993, Bevan Morris campaigned for a seat in a district in suburban Adelaide for the Australian House of Representatives on the NLP ticket.[8] The Natural Law Party was active in Canadian federal and provincial elections. The Natural Law Party in India is known as the Ajeya Bharat Party (AJBP) or Invincible India Party.[6] It promotes a Vedic way of life.[9] It was formed in late 1998 as the political wing of the Maharishi Vedic Vishwa Prashasan (MVVP (Maharishi Global Administration Through Natural Law)), which had nominated thirty-four candidates in the February 1998 parliamentary election from Madhya Pradesh. The Maharishi was said to be "keenly interested" in building a political base in his native province.[5] The MVVP received 0.28% of the vote in its first election.[10] Mukesh Nayak left the cabinet and the Congress Party to assume the leadership of the Madhya Pradesh MVVP.[11] For the November 1998 election, the Ajeya Bharat had a list of 100 candidates for the Assembly.[5] It received 0.5% of the vote and won one seat in the 320-member state assembly.[12] The following year, that member switched parties, leaving the Ajeya Bharat with no representation.[13] In 2008, Nayak left the party to rejoin the Congress Party.[14] In 2009, the Ajeya Bharat Party president, Ambati Krishnamurthy, filed a complaint against another party for using a flag similar to its own.[15] The NLP was active in Ireland since 1994, and was based in Dublin under the leadership of John Burns who ran with nine other NLP candidates in the 1997 General Election and four others in the 1999 European elections. In the European election, Burns called on NATO to cease bombing in Yugoslavia and instead send 7000 yogic flyers to the region. Those five European candidates collected nearly 7000 votes between them.[16] Party leader John Burns, who contested the 2000 Dublin South Central by-election, spent only 163 on his campaign. The amount of corporate donations in 2000 was nil.[17] The Natural Law Party of Israel (Hebrew:     , Mifleget Hok HaTeva Shel Yisrael) was a minor political party in Israel. Its leader was Amihai Rokah.[18] In the 1992 elections the Natural Law Party won 1,734 votes (0.06%), and in the 1999 elections, won 2,924 votes (0.09%), both below the then 1.5% electoral threshold required to enter the Knesset. It has not run in an election since and its website states it has ceased political activity,[19] but as of 2011 it is still registered as a party in Israel.[20] The Natural Law Party in Italy (Partito della Legge Naturale, PLN) took place to several (both general and local) elections in the nineties. In the 1994 general elections it won 24,897 votes (0.06%) for the Chamber of Deputies[21] and 86,588 votes (0.26%) for the Senate.[22] The list was on ballot in a few constituencies only. In the 1996 general elections the Natural Law Party ran candidates only in the Trentino-Alto Adige/Sdtirol region, who won 8,298 votes for the Chamber of Deputies[23] and 5,842 for the Senate (about 1% on a regional basis, 0.2% in the whole country).[24] The Natural Law Party of New Zealand was formed in 1995.[citation needed] The Natural Law Party never won any seats in Parliament, and was removed from the register of official political parties in February 2001.[citation needed] The Natural Law Party in Trinidad and Tobago contested the 1995 general elections. It received 1,590 votes, but failed to win a seat.[25] The Natural Law Party was founded in the United Kingdom in March 1992. Geoffrey Clements was its Party Leader. The UK manifesto, as published on its website [1] was founded on assertions that included: The UK manifesto also asserted that Natural Law governs the universe, including the lives of the citizens of the UK, and that the Natural Law party had "the scientific knowledge as efficient and nourishing as the government of Nature."[1] In the 1992 general election, held on 9 April, 310 candidates stood for the NLP in the UK, garnering 0.19% of the vote, with every candidate losing their deposit for failing to receive at least 5% of the vote.[26] The group announced that they had budgeted nearly 1 million pounds for the campaign.[27] A significant number of constituencies were contested by nationals of countries outside the UK, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and India, as British electoral law allows any member of a Commonwealth country to stand for Parliament. Among them was Canadian-born magician Doug Henning.[28] George Harrison performed a fund-raising concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London for the NLP on 6 April 1992, his first full concert in the UK since 1969.[29] A week before the general election, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi suggested to Harrison that he, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr stand for election as MPs for Liverpool as NLP candidates, but they declined.[30] In the 1997 general election, the NLP ran 197 candidates for Parliament in the UK, garnering 0.10% of the vote, with every candidate losing their deposit.[31] The NLP ran 16 candidates in the 20 by-elections held between 1992 and 1997, with every candidate losing their deposit.[32] The NLP ran 8 candidates for the 16 by-elections held between 1997 and 2001, averaging 0.10% of the vote, with every candidate losing their deposit.[33] The NLP did not run any candidates for Parliament in the 2001 general election or in the succeeding by-elections.[34][35] The party, along with its Northern Ireland wing, voluntarily deregistered with the Electoral Commission at the end of 2003.[36] A 70-page Natural Law Party paper was prepared in the context of the 1996 Framework Document of the British and Irish governments. The paper was presented to leaders in Ireland and Northern Ireland to prominent people in the USA. The NLP was invited to take part in the special elections to the Northern Ireland Forum, but withdrew before the election, bringing praise from sections of the political spectrum in Northern Ireland.[37] The Natural Law Party (United States) ran John Hagelin as its presidential candidate in 1992, 1996, and 2000. He was on ballots in 48 states and received 0.12% of the vote in 1996. The party also ran congressional and local candidates. In California, psychiatrist Harold H. Bloomfield ran as candidate for Governor in 1998.[38] It attempted to merge with the Reform Party in 2000. The NLP in the United States was largely disbanded in 2004. However, some state affiliates, such as Michigan, have kept their ballot positions and have allied with other small parties.[39]
