Erigeron utahensis is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family known by the common name Utah fleabane. It is native to the western United States from California to Colorado. This is a perennial daisy growing from a stout taproot and caudex to anywhere from 10 to 50 centimeters in height. Its branching stem and leaves are covered in whitish hairs. The inflorescence holds one to several flower heads, each between one and two centimeters wide. They have yellow centers and lavender to bluish ray florets around the edges.
