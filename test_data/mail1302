ChromaDex is a publicly traded natural products company based in Irvine, California. The company is most well-known for its industry standard phytochemical testing laboratories and catalogue. In cooperation with the University of Mississippi, the company is currently exploring the effects of pterostiibene on humans.[1][2] ChromaDex has licensed patents from the University of Mississippi and the USDA to commercially develop pterostilbene and sell the compound trademarked as pTeroPure via the company's BluScience product line.[3][1] In 2010, ChromaDex won the North American Frost & Sullivan Award for Most Promising Ingredient of the Year for pTeroPure pterostilbene.[4][1] American billionaire and pharmaceutical entrepreneur Phillip Frost owns approximately 19% of ChromaDex.[5][6][1] ChromaDex was founded in 1999. According to a Standard & Poor's research report, the company was created "in response to growing demand for natural product reference standards, materials and services. It has worked to establish itself as an industry leader in nutraceutical and botanical certification, and even publishes its own manual outlining specifications for phytochemicals." On July 14, 2008 ChromaDex merged with CDI Acquisition, a subsidiary of Cody Resources Inc. On July 29, 2008 the company completed a private placement agreement, which yielded gross proceeds of $4.67 million.[7][1] Later in 2008, ChromaDex (OTCBB: CDXC) became a publicly traded company. Shares of ChromaDex are traded on the NASD Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board.[1] As of April 2012, there were 90.1 million shares outstanding.[8] The ChromaDex catalogue "provides phytochemical reference standards, botanical reference materials and research grade materials for the natural products industry." The company sells over 3,000 phytochemicals and 470 botanical reference materials in its catalogue. The company's products reach a wide range of markets including food & beverage, pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, research organizations and governmental groups.[1] ChromaDex received exclusive worldwide patent rights for its pTeroPure pterostilbene product based on the technology licensed from the University of Mississippi and the USDA.[1] Similar to resveratrol, which the Mayo Clinic describes as "a key ingredient in red wine that helps prevent damage to blood vessels, reduces "bad" cholesterol and prevents blood clots"[9][1] pterostilbene belongs to a class of compounds called phytoalexins, which are antimicrobial substances synthesized de novo by plants that accumulate rapidly at areas of incompatible pathogen infection. Based on animal studies pterostilbene is thought to exhibit anti-cancer, anti-hypercholesterolemia, anti-hypertriglyceridemia properties, as well as fight off and reverse cognitive decline.[10][1] Pterostilbene and resveratrol have similar pharmacologic properties. However pterostilbene has exhibited advantages over resveratrol including superior biological activity, better oral bioavailability, and a slower metabolizing time, which provides more time for the compound's antioxidant activities to act.[1][11][12][13] According to the USDA, "pterostilbene is one of many aromatic hydrocarbons called stilbenes." ChromaDex's pTeroPure is an identical form of trans-pterostilbene. The company sells pTeroPure under its BluScience product line.[14][1] The University of California, Irvine, is currently studying pTeroPure for its efficacy as a treatment for melanomas and other skin cancers when used in a skincare product.[15] On July 13, 2011, Cornell University announced it granted ChromaDex exclusive worldwide rights to a novel manufacturing process for nicotinamide riboside (NR).[1] NR, a vitamin found in milk, is a more potent version of niacin (vitamin B3). Like niacin, NR is a precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), which is elevated by a calorie restricted diet. Increasing cellular NAD has demonstrated cell-protective and positive metabolic effects. In laboratory tests, "NR has shown promise for improving cardiovascular health, glucose levels and cognitive function and has demonstrated evidence of anti-ageing effects."[15][16] ChromaDex also offers contract research services that help customers source raw materials, identify new compounds and develop processes for large scale manufacturing. The company also has a number of analytical capabilities including gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and high performance liquid chromatography.[8][1] Phillip Frost Pterostilbene Resveratrol
