Kjukevag Bay (6936S 3941E / 69.6S 39.683E / -69.6; 39.683Coordinates: 6936S 3941E / 69.6S 39.683E / -69.6; 39.683) is a small bay formed between the seaward projection of Telen Glacier and the coast just northward, on the east coast of Lutzow-Holm Bay. Mapped by Norwegian cartographers from air photos taken by the Lars Christensen Expedition, 193637, and named Kjukevag (lump bay) because of its proximity to Kjuka Headland. This article incorporatespublic domain material from the United States Geological Survey document "Kjukevag Bay" (content from the Geographic Names Information System).
