WNPV (1440 AM) is a radio station owned by WNPV, Inc. and licensed to Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA. It serves Montgomery, Bucks and Philadelphia Counties, broadcasting a News/Talk format. Founded in 1960, it features a blend of nationally syndicated and local talk shows, plus Fox News Radio updates and local news throughout the day. WNPV also broadcasts Phillies Baseball games, NASCAR and IRL races, as well as Penn State Football games. Phillies coverage will be preempted if it conflicts with race or football coverage.
