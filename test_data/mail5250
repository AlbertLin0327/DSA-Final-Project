Atlantis is the sixteenth album by Wayne Shorter. It was released on the Columbia label in 1985 and was Shorter's first solo album since 1974. The recording is notable in Shorter's body of work both for its relative lack of improvisation and for the high level of its compositions and group arrangements. Rock (backbeat) and latin rhythms are featured on several tracks, as is mixed electric and acoustic instrumentation. The composition "Shere Khan, the Tiger" was previously recorded by a group including Shorter and Carlos Santana on the latter's 1980 album The Swing of Delight. Several of the compositions on this album would continue to feature in Shorter's repertoire well into 2008, most notably the title piece. The cover art for the album is a pastel portrait of Shorter by actor Billy Dee Williams.
