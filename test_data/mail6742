"Freedom" is a Jimi Hendrix song released in 1971 from the album The Cry of Love. The album was released posthumously in 1971 and became a major hit. This was the only single released from the album and was somewhat successful on the charts, reaching number 59 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.[1] It is now one of the more popular songs in the Hendrix collection, and is a staple in many compilation works. It was later featured on the 1997 album First Rays of the New Rising Sun. The lyrics "Keep on pushing straight ahead..." towards the end of the song are most likely a reference to the Curtis Mayfield song "Keep On Pushing" from the album of the same name. Mayfield was a major influence on Hendrix, from whom he borrowed much of his R&B rhythm guitar style, as heard on recordings such as "Have You Ever Been (To Electric Ladyland)" and "Little Wing". "Straight ahead" is a phrase which features on several tracks from the period- and it was one of the titles considered for his final studio album. In 1994, Steve Lukather sang this song for his album Candyman. As of March 19, 2009, the song, as well as "Angel" and "Foxy Lady (Live At Woodstock)" has been released as downloadable content for Guitar Hero: World Tour in the Jimi Hendrix Track Pack 2.
