The Hahn Problem (also Hahn's problem or Hahn's question) refers to the theoretical challenge of building general equilibrium models where money does not enter preferences, but yet has a positive value. It is named after the British economist Frank Hahn who outlined this problem in his 1965 paper, "On Some Problems of Proving the Existence of an Equilibrium in a Monetary Economy".[1]
I read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org
