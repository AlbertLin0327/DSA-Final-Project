"Bullets in the Gun" is the title of a song co-written by Toby Keith and Rivers Rutherford, and recorded by Keith. It is the title track to, and second single from, his 2010 album Bullets in the Gun. The song was released on September 27, 2010 and entered the country music charts at number 37. The song plays on the Bonnie and Clyde story to give a modernized account of a vagabond outlaw couple. The song concludes where guns blazing as the couple goes out in a firefight with the law.[citation needed] Juli Thanki of The 9513 gave the song a "thumbs up", saying that Keith's vocals had "nearly tangible bravado".[1] Randy Lewis of the Los Angeles Times called the song "cinematic" and compared it to Marty Robbins's "El Paso".[2] Reviewing for the New York Times, Jon Caramanica called the song "a pumped-up and comically desperate tale" and "almost parodic".[3] Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave the song a positive review, saying that it was Keith's best single in a decade. He also called it "a fantastic reminder of how a strongly lyrical song can take us places and into a movie in our minds." Bjorke also said that "even if you dont condone the fictional story being told, its still a damn good song with a melody which suits the lyric perfectly."[4] In January 2011, Emily Robison of the Dixie Chicks stated during a video chat that she thought the song resembled Robert Earl Keen's "The Road Goes On Forever".[5] Michael Salomon directed the song's music video.[6] It stars Danielle Vasinova and Chad Bannon. "Bullets in the Gun" debuted at number 37 on the Hot Country Songs chart dated for the week ending October 9, 2010. It also debuted at number 97 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for the week of November 20, 2010.[7]
