"The Boys of Wexford" is a famous Irish ballad commemorating the Irish Rebellion of 1798. The ballad was lyrics were composed by Patrick Joseph McCall and music by Arthur Warren Darley, who also composed other wexford ballads "Boolavogue", "Kelly the Boy from Killanne".[1] (Chorus): We are the boys of Wexford, Who fought with heart and hand To burst in twain the galling chain And free our native land. In comes the captain's daughter, The captain of the Yeos, Saying "Brave United Irishmen, We'll ne'er again be foes. A thousand pounds I'll bring If you will fly from home with me, And dress myself in man's attire And fight for liberty." I want no gold, my maiden fair, To fly from home with thee. You shining eyes will be my prize, More dear than gold to me. I want no gold to nerve my arm To do a true man's part - To free my land I'd gladly give The red drops of my heart." And when we left our cabins, boys, We left with right good will To see our friends and neighbours That were at Vinegar Hill! A young man from our Irish ranks A cannon he let go; He slapt it into Lord Mountjoy A tyrant he laid low! We bravely fought and conquered At Ross and Wexford town; And if we failed to keep them, 'Twas drink that brought us down. We had no drink beside us On Tubberneering's day, Depending on the long, bright pike, And well it worked that way. And Oulart's name shall be their shame, Whose steel we ne'er did fear. For every man could do his part Like Forth and Shelmalier! And if for want of leaders, We lost at Vinegar Hill, We're ready for another fight, And love our country still!
