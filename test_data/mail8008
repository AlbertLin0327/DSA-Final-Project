"The Cats of Copenhagen" is a posthumously-published short story by Irish author James Joyce. Written in 1936 for his grandson Stephen James Joyce, it was not published until 2012, when Joyce's work entered the public domain. The story describes the city of Copenhagen, Denmark, where "things are not as they seem", and is critical of "fat cats" and other authority figures. Ithys Press published their fine arts edition of The Cats of Copenhagen in January of 2012.[1] This edition features original pen and ink illustrations by Casey Sorrow,[2][3] letterpress typeset by Michael Caine,[4] and hand-made paper marbling and binding of Christopher Rowlatt.[5] The publication attracted controversy, as it was claimed by the James Joyce Foundation's Fritz Senn that only previously published work by Joyce was in the public domain, and the Foundation still held copyright over The Cats of Copenhagen.[6][7][8][9][10][11]
