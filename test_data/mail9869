The Rotokawa Power Station is a geothermal power station owned and operated by Mighty River Power. It is located approximately 10 km north east of Taupo in New Zealand. The station uses a binary cycle manufactured by Ormat Industries. In May 2008, work began on the nearby Nga Awa Purua Power Station.[1] Due to the high temperatures associated with the geothermal vent here, this locale is an occurrence of extremophile micro-organisms that can thrive on the high vent water temperature.[2]
