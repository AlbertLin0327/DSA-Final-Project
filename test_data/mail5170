South Coast is an album by American folk musician Ramblin' Jack Elliott, released in 1998. It was his first new studio release in over 20 years. At the Grammy Awards of 1996, South Coast won the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album. Writing for Allmusic, music critic Burgin Matthews wrote the album "Elliott also reveals himself as one of the few truly enduring figures of the folk era, partly because his music is more honest, and as a result more timeless, than so much of that era's music... With South Coast, Elliott's legend is irrevocably cemented."[1] Production notes:
