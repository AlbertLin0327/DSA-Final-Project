The Pasped W-1 Skylark is a 1930s American two-seat single-engined cabin monoplane designed and built by the Pasped Aircraft Company of Glendale, California.[1] The Skylark is a braced low-wing monoplane with a fixed tailwheel landing gear.[1] It is powered by a 125hp (93kW) Warner Scarab radial engine.[1] The enclosed cockpit has side-by-side seating for two.[1] It has a welded steel fuselage and wooden wings.[1] With other two-seat aircraft of the era having a better performance on smaller engines the Skylark did not enter production.[1] The sole example was currently airworthy in February 2010 with an owner in Versailles, Missouri.
