Operation Smile is a nonprofit medical service organization based in Norfolk, Virginia, founded in 1982. A secular non-governmental organization, the children's medical charity provides cleft lip and palate repair surgeries to children worldwide, assists countries in reaching self-sufficiency with these surgeries, and works to reduce the occurrence of cleft lips and palates. To date, Operation Smile has provided reconstructive surgery to over 150,000 children and young adults in more than 60 countries.[1][2] In early 2011, Operation Smile and Smile Train announced the two charities would merge,[3][4] followed three weeks later by announcements the merger had been aborted,[5] Smile Train having canceled the union.[6] Operation Smile was created by Dr. Bill and Kathy Magee after they participated in a Philippine cleft repair mission in 1982 and recognized a need for more missions. According to a 2003 interview,[7] when asked about the start of Operation Smile, Magee said: The scope of the organization increased after Mother Teresa invited Operation Smile to come to India to treat deformed children.[8] Dr. Magee is the chief executive officer of Operation Smile. His wife, Kathy Magee, serves as the president on a full-time, volunteer basis and is a lifetime member of the Board of Directors. Dr. William P. Magee, Jr. and Kathleen S. Magee were awarded The Spirit of Raoul Wallenberg Award from the American Swedish Historical Museum in 1998 for their work in establishing a network of professionals and volunteers engaged in restoring badly deformed faces of children.[9] Dr. Magee received the 2001 Antonio Feltrinelli Prize (Premi "Antonio Feltrinelli" awarded by the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei for Exceptional Endeavors of Outstanding Moral and Humanitarian Value, received the U.N. Servants of Peace Award, presented the Honorary Kazanjian Lecture to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, and in 1998, received the Distinguished Service Award from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.[10] Operation Smile organizes international volunteer missions to provide cleft lip and palate repair in developing countries, coordinates programs for training physicians from around the world, manages programs to assist host countries in reaching cleft lip and cleft palate repair self-sufficiency, supports education and research programs to eradicate cleft lips and palates, and organizes global volunteer programs for high-school and college students. For each mission, Operation Smile verifies the credentials and organizes the participation and travel arrangements for a team of volunteers.[11] The team typically includes a mission site coordinator, plastic surgeons, anesthesiologists, a pediatrician, an intensive care physician, head or coordinating nurse, pre- and post-op nurses, child development specialists, speech pathologists,[12] dentists and/or orthodontists. Teams are organized with volunteers from within the host nation as well as from other nations. Many of the volunteers provide important logistical (non-medical) support to the mission; they may serve as translators, medical records technicians, photographers, or help in such areas as food services, lodging, procurement of supplies, or transportation. The teams also typically include two high school students who fulfill various functions, including giving presentations on health maintenance and dental hygiene to families living near the mission site. Operation Smile coordinates the donation, purchase and delivery of medical provisions (equipment, medications, supplies) for each mission. In 2005, these volunteer medical teams provided free surgeries for 8,359 children through international and local, in-country medical missions[citation needed]. During the fiscal year of 2009, Operation Smile provided free surgeries for nearly 13,000 children and young adults suffering from cleft lip and/or cleft palate. Operation Smiles partner countries include: On a case by case basis, Operation Smile will bring extraordinary craniofacial cases to Norfolk, Virginiawhen mission conditions are inappropriate for the severity of the case. As of June 2007, approximately 200 World Care patients have been treated.[27] The program may be expanded to other locations.[28] Operation Smile has Global Resource Chapters that raise funds and awareness to support its programs. Mission teams are hosted by International Foundations that are responsible for all in-country mission logistics and that also raise funds and awareness throughout the year. Comprehensive Care Clinics To aid countries in becoming self-sufficient at caring for cleft patients, beginning in early 2007 the organization will open seven medical clinics in Colombia, Honduras, Morocco, China, India, the Philippines and Vietnam.[29] The centers will provide surgeries and treatment, educate local volunteers, perform local development activities and manage local communications / administrative services. The center in Vietnam will treat 2,000 patients annually and train about 1,000 medical professionals.[29] Operation Smile provides a network of resources to assist families in the U.S. with children born with facial deformities. This network is accessed through the Operation Smile Web site and includes a listing of Referral Web Sites plus a Physicians Resource List with the names of doctors available to review a case. Operation Smile provides a framework for its partner countries to come together to share knowledge, technology and skills through the use of programs customized to each countrys specific medical infrastructure. University Partnerships offer Operation Smile medical volunteers training in advanced techniques and provide opportunities including fellowships, emeritus professorships and visiting professorship programs. Education Exchange programs are also offered through partnerships with leading medical teaching institutions. The annual Operation Smile Physicians' Training Program (PTP) brings surgeons from around the world to the United States for training in specialized surgical skills. The program has helped train more than 650 international physicians in advanced craniofacial techniques.[10] Operation Smile has twice hosted a global summit on medical standards in Norfolk, VA.[30][31] More than 600 Operation Smile Student Associations in the United States and around the world build awareness, raise funds and educate students about the values of commitment, leadership and volunteerism. Operation Smile sends hundreds of students on missions each year. Generally two go on each mission, along with an adult sponsor. The student team takes toys and games to help keep the kids occupied while waiting for surgery. Before the students go on a mission however, they must apply and be selected to attend Mission Training Workshop (MTW), which is held twice a year. At MTW students are taught four health modules, Dental Hygiene, Oral Re-hydration Therapy, Nutrition, and Burn Care and Prevention. Students make posters for each of these modules and present them on the missions, delivering critical information teaching families simple things that can save lives. The International Student Leadership Conference (ISLC) is a big aspect of Operation Smile Student Programs. The 2006 ISLC was held at Weber State University in Utah, and the 2005 ISLC was held at William & Mary in Virginia. The 2007 ISLC was held at the University of Limerick in Ireland. The 2008 ISLC was held at San Diego State University, the 2009 ISLC was held at Christopher Newport University in Virginia, and the 2010 was held at the University of Denver.[32] In November 1999, specific patient deaths[36] brought criticism on Operation Smile's medical procedures, suggesting the organization prioritized publicity and volume over patient welfare and safety.[37][38]In response, Operation Smile conducted an internal review. Initially, the organization "promised to make public the full findings of the review," though later chose not to release the findings, considering the review "an internal matter". Several directors disagreed with this choice and left the board. Four months after announcing the review, the organization publicly admitted organizational flaws.[39] By 2002, the organization also established medical credential standards, improved medical monitoring of patients, and implemented quality and financial controls.[40] Film Producer, Director, Producer, and Author Perry Moore ("The Chronicles of Narnia, Executive Producer; author of the LAMBDA award-winning HERO) was a student volunteer in 1988 and, trained as a scrub and health care advisor, he was part of the team that traveled to Manila and then to Naga City in the Philippines. Operation Smile announced in late 2007 that it would relocate its world headquarters approximately 16 miles (26km) from its current location in Norfolk, to a new building in Virginia Beach.[54] The projected 65,000-square-foot (6,000m2) building is sited adjacent to a projected regional health profession center to be built by Tidewater Community College. The headquarters will occupy land owned by the city of Virginia Beach and will receive funds from the city for site improvements, including landscaping, utility service and sidewalks. As of January 1, 2012, Operation Smile is still listed as being headquartered on Tidewater Drive in Norfolk, according to their website.
