The Rubber City Rollergirls (RCRG) is a roller derby league based in Akron, Ohio. Founded in 2008, the league consists of two teams, which compete against teams from other leagues. Rubber City played its first bout, at the John S. Knight Center, in April 2009.[1] The league was accepted into the Women's Flat Track Derby Association Apprentice Program in January 2010,[2] and instituted its B team later in the year.[3] By 2011, it had forty skaters, and was claiming crowds of 1,000 fans.[4]
