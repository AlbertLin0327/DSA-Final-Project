Captain Louis Peugnet House is a historic home located at Cape Vincent in Jefferson County, New York. The limestone farmhouse was built about 1837 and is a 1 12-story five-bay structure with a central entry and a steeply pitched gable roof. It features an open porch with four square wooden columns that extends across the full width of the facade. Also on the property is a 19th-century barn.[2] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.[1]
