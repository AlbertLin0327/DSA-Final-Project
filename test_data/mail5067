The National Council of Churches in the Philippines (NCCP) (Tagalog: Sanguniang Pambansa ng mga Simbahan sa Pilipinas) is a fellowship of ten mainline Protestant and non-Roman Catholic denominations, and ten service-oriented organizations in the Philippines. It represents close to twelve million adherents. Advocacy for environmental protection and against large-scale mining are part of its core mission.[1] Christian organizations other than churches may be received as associate members. It is member of the World Council of Churches and the Christian Conference of Asia. The NCCP was established in 1963. Its forerunners include the Philippine Federation of Christian Churches in 1949, the Philippine Federation of Evangelical Churches in 1939, the National Christian Council in 1929, the Evangelical Union in 1901, and the Missionary Alliance in 1900.[citation needed] It is organized in ten regional ecumenical councils:[2] The NCCP is located at 879 Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, West Triangle, Quezon City, 1104 Philippines. Its Secretary-General is the Rev. Fr. Rex Reyes of the Episcopal Church in the Philippines. Life in all its Fullness is what Jesus Christ lived and died for. NCCP envisions this life in a just, egalitarian, self-reliant, and sustainable society.[citation needed] Our faith and vision move us to be an ecumenical fellowship of churches, be a channel for united witness and common action, by being in solidarity with the people in the struggle for justice, peace and the integrity of creation.[citation needed]
