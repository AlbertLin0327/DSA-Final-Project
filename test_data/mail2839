Razak Pimpong (born 30 December 1982) is a Ghanaian footballer who plays as an striker and attacking midfielder for the Danish 1st Division club Viborg FF. He is very versatile as he also plays wide either as Right side midfielder or Right wing forward. Brought from Ghana to Denmark by FC Midtjylland, and made his debut for the team in 2000. In July 2005, he agreed a move to league rivals F.C. Kbenhavn from January 2006. Pimpong did not find initial success at FCK. His first, and only goal, for FCK came on April 2006, when he scored the deciding goal of the 2006 Royal League Final.[1] He came on in the 69th minute; scored the only goal of the game in the 89th minute; before he was sent off in injury time for overtly celebrating his goal. In 2007, Pimpong was transferred to Norwegian Tippeligaen club Viking FK for a sum reported to be around 4 million Norwegian Kroner.[2] He signed a contract keeping him at the club until 2010.[3] In 2009, Egyptian side Al-Masry have signed Pimpong from Norwegian side Viking FK, the Port Said-based club announced on January 25[4] and signed few months later on 27 July 2009 for Danish club Viborg FF and has been linked with various clubs across Europe recently, even though he is still contracted till the summer of 2012.[5] Pimpong was part of the Ghanaian 2004 Olympic football team, who exited in the first round, having finished in third place in group B. He was called up for the Ghanaian squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, due to several fine performances for FCK. At the World Cup, Pimpong showed the dribbling skills that earned him a transfer to FCK, but did not score any goals and missed some vital chances. He has played nine games for the Ghanaian national team, and represented Ghana at the 2004 Summer Olympic football tournament as well as the 2006 World Cup in Germany.[6]
