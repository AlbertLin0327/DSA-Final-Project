Intoxifornication is the second album by Gregg Alexander, released on May 5, 1992. It includes five tracks ("Michigan Rain", "Loving You Sets Me Free", "Save Me From Myself", "Cruel With Me" and "The World We Love So Much") that had already been released on Alexander's 1989 debut album Michigan Rain. Both "Smokin' In Bed" and "The Truth" were released as one-track promotional singles.[2][3] "The Truth" includes the lines "Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes/Are you ready?/Here comes the lawsuit, baby", followed by Alexander covering the refrain of "Slow Ride" by Foghat. All songs written by Gregg Alexander.
