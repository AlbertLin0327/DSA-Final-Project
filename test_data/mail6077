Mandurriao Airport (Filipino: Paliparan ng Mandurriao, Hiligaynon: Hulugpaan sang Mandurriao), also known as Iloilo Airport during its operation, was the main airport serving the area of Iloilo City and the province of Iloilo in the Philippines. The airport was located five kilometers northwest of downtown Iloilo City in the district of Mandurriao. The airport was the fourth-busiest airport overall and the busiest domestic airport in the Philippines, accommodating over 700,000 passengers and over 5,000 tons of cargo in 2005.[1] Having been in service since the 1930s, Mandurriao Airport has since been replaced by Iloilo International Airport, located nineteen kilometers northwest of Iloilo City proper and subsequently decommissioned on June 14, 2007. Current plans for the airport complex include converting it into a new business development. Under Executive Order 282, an Asset Disposition Program was created to study the method of privatization of the property. Executive Order 360 devolved the chairmanship of this program to the Department of Finance. The Old Iloilo Airport property in Manduriao has been scheduled for privatization by first half of 2007. The city government views the successful privatization of this property as key to the revitalization of Iloilo City. As of 3 April 2007, 5 large Philippine real estate developers pre-qualified as bidders of the airport. These are Ayala Land, Empire East, Robinsons Land, Rockwell Land, and SM Prime. The Privatization Council set the minimum price for the 54 hectare property at P1.2 billion (P2,200 per square meter). The bidding for the Manduriao Airport was conducted on 9 May 2007. Among the pre-qualified bidders, only Robinsons Land, Empire East, and SM Prime Participated. The following table shows their respective bids: Developer - Bid Robinsons Land - P 1,089 million Empire East - P701 million SM Prime - P436 million The Old Iloilo Airport Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) declared a failed bidding because no bid went above the minimum price. Thereafter, the BAC decided to enter into a Negotiated Sale process. The 5 pre-qualified bidders were then invited to participate. However, a member of the Privatization Council was adamant in keeping the P1.2 billion minimum price. Only Robinsons Land submitted a bid on the last day of the Negotiated Sale, 14 June 2007. It bid P908 million for the property. The BAC had no choice but to declare a failure on the Negotiated Sale. Unfortunately for the people of Iloilo and the local city government, some BAC members have no private sector experience and they do not see the logic behind RLC's lower bid. The BAC worked on lowering the minimum price of the property. However, some agencies have not consulted their principals on the minimum price that these principals are comfortable with. Months after battling technicalities, the bidding pushed through. Megaworld acquired the 54-hectare old Iloilo Airport site for Php 1.2 billion (roughly $2.5 million) to be developed into a mixed-use residential and commercial complex.
