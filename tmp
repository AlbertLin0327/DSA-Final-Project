John Ryan "J.R." Fitzpatrick (born May 9, 1988 in Cambridge, Ontario) is a Canadian stock car driver. He is currently the youngest driver to win the CASCAR Super Series championship. He drives the No. 84 Chevrolet for Fitzpatrick Motorsports in the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series and the No. 60 Chevrolet for Turn One Racing in the Camping World Truck Series. John Ryan (J.R.) Fitzpatrick got his first taste of racing in karts at the age of six, moving quickly to the Canadian Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (CASCAR) junior ranks and then on to Late Model stock cars by the time he was 13 years old. Racing in the Cascar Super Series what is now the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series at age 16, Fitzpatrick finished 11th in the point standings and second in the Rookie of the Year standings in 2004. Then at 17, he achieved three top-five and five top-10 finishes, scoring his first win. At age 18, he became the youngest driver to become a Canadian Tire Series National Champion with one win, five podium finishes and two pole awards. He remained in his fathers #84 Chevrolet after CASCAR was acquired by NASCAR; In 2007, Fitzpatrick earned two wins, four top-fives, seven top-10s and three pole awards in the Canadian Tire Series where sponsorship came from Milwaukee Tools. In 2008 he had one victory (Mosport), five top-fives, six top-10s and two pole awards. While 2009, he drove the #84 for a part time deal winning Circuit Gilles Villeneuve leading the most laps. For 2010 he returned to the series full time with sponsorship from Shick he picked up his first win of the season at Mosport on the road course layout on June 13 and also won the event at Edmonton, he swapped the points lead with D.J. Kennington for over five times during the year going on to finishes second in the points. He ran again in the series in 2011, finishing third in points; he will return to the series in the No. 84 in 2012.[1] In early 2012 it was announced that Fitzpatrick would compete in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race in August 2012 at Watkins Glen International for Turn One Racing.[1] Fitzpatrick made his mainstream NASCAR debut in the NASCAR Busch Series (now the NASCAR Nationwide Series) race at the Telcel-Motorola Mexico 200 at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in Mexico City, Mexico. He came in 33rd place in that race[2] due to an ill handling racecar. He finished 43rd in the NASCAR Busch Series race at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Quebec on August 4, 2007,[3] right after the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series race at the same track where he won the race. He drove the famed #4 KHI Chevy at both of the road courses in 2009. He Finishing 19th at Watkins Glen after getting in a wreck on the last lap. In Montreal he was on pace for a top 10 finish before staling the car after going off course leading to a poor finish one lap down. It was announced that J.R. will drive for Dale Earnhardt Jr. in all three road course in his #7 team for 2010, he picked up his first Nationwide top 10 coming home 7th at Road America (Nationwide)on June 19 and his second top 10 with a 7th in Montreal. Fitzpatrick returned to the Nationwide Series with Baker Curb Racing at Daytona International Speedway sponsored by Schick. However, he finished 42nd in the race. He competed in six further races during the year for Go Canada Racing. On Feb. 13, 2009, Fitzpatrick finished fourth in his No. 7 Mammoet Chevrolet Silverado at Daytona International Speedway during the NextEra Energy Resources 250 Camping World Truck Series Event. Fitzpatrick led 17 laps in the event, his third race in the series and first at a restrictor plate track.[4] After Martinsville his deal with Kevin Buckler at TRG Motorsports fell through and he was a free agent. After driving several races for Kevin Harvick, Inc. and Chase Mattioli in 2009 and 2011, he moved full-time to the Camping World Truck Series in 2012, driving the No. 60 Chevrolet for Turn One Racing.[1] 2010 Nationwide car at Road America 2011 Nationwide car at Road America

Subject: Balance (game design) 
To: Chelsea
Content:
In game design, balance is the concept and the practice of tuning a game's rules, usually with the goal of preventing any of its component systems from being ineffective or otherwise undesirable when compared to their peers. An unbalanced system represents wasted development resources at the very least, and at worst can undermine the game's entire ruleset by making important roles or tasks impossible to perform.[1] Balancing does not necessarily mean making a game fair. This is particularly true of action games: Jaime Griesemer, design lead at Bungie, said in a lecture to other designers that "every fight in Halo is unfair".[2] This potential for unfairness creates uncertainty, leading to the tension and excitement that action games seek to deliver.[3][4][1] In these cases balancing is instead the management of unfair scenarios, with the ultimate goal of ensuring that all of the strategies which the game intends to support are viable.[2] The extent to which those strategies are equal to one another defines the character of the game in question. Simulation games can be balanced unfairly in order to be true to life. A wargame may cast the player into the role of a general who was defeated by an overwhelming force, and it is common for the abilities of teams in sports games to mirror those of the real-world teams they represent regardless of the implications for players who pick them. Digital games often allow players to influence their balance by offering a choice of "difficulty levels".[5] These affect how challenging the game is to play. In addition to altering the game's rules, difficulty levels can be used to alter what content is presented to the player. This usually takes the form of adding or removing challenging location or events, but some games also change their narrative to reward players who play them on higher difficulty levels (Max Payne 2) or end early as punishment for playing on easy (Castlevania). Difficulty selection is not always presented bluntly, particularly in competitive games where all players are affected equally and the standard "easy/hard" terminology no longer applies. Sometimes veiled language is used (Mario Kart offers "CC select"), while at other times there may be an array of granular settings instead of an overarching difficulty option. An alternative approach to difficulty levels is catering to players of all abilities at the same time, a technique that has been called "subjective difficulty".[6] This requires a game to provide multiple solutions or routes, each offering challenges appropriate to players of different skill levels (Super Mario Galaxy, Sonic Generations). Difficulty can also be managed by a third party or the game itself; see the Gamemaster section below. Balancing goals shift dramatically when players are contending with the game's environment and/or non-player characters. Such player versus environment games are usually balanced to tread the fine line of regularly challenging players' abilities without ever producing insurmountable or unfair obstacles.[4] This turns balancing into the management of dramatic structure,[3] generally referred to by game designers as "pacing". Pacing is also a consideration in competitive games, but the autonomy of players makes it harder to control. The simplest game balancing technique is giving each player identical resources. Most competitive games feature some level of symmetry; some (such as Pong) are completely symmetric, but those in which players alternate turns (such as Chess) can never achieve total symmetry as one player will always have a first-move advantage. Symmetry can be undone by human psychology. The advantage of players wearing red over players wearing blue is a well-documented example of this.[7][8] The brute force approach to balancing is the mathematical analysis of game session results. With enough data, it is possible to identify unbalanced areas of a game and make corrections. Randomisation of starting conditions is a technique common in board games, card games, and also experimental research[9] which fights back against the human tendency to optimise patterns in one's favour.[2] The downside of randomisation is that it takes control away from the player, potentially leading to frustration. Methods of overcoming this include giving the player a selection of random results within which they can optimise (Scrabble, Magic: The Gathering) and making each game session short enough to encourage multiple attempts in one play session (Klondike (solitaire), Strange Adventures in Infinite Space). Many games become more challenging if the player is successful. For instance, real-time strategy games often feature "upkeep", a resource tax that scales with the number of units under a player's control.[10] Team games which challenge players to invade their opponents' territory (football, capture the flag) have a feedback loop by default: the further a player pushes, the more opponents they are likely to face. Feedback loops can lead to frequent ties if enforced too strictly. See also Dynamic game difficulty balancing. A game can be balanced dynamically by a gamemaster who observes players and adjusts the game in response to their emotional state (Dungeons & Dragons, Left 4 Dead). Although gamemasters have historically been humans, some videogames now feature AI systems that perform a similar role by monitoring player ability and inferring emotional state from input.[4] Research into biofeedback peripherals is set to greatly improve the accuracy of such systems.[11] In role-playing game slang, a "gimp" is a character, character class or character ability that is underpowered in the context of the game. Gimped characters lack effectiveness compared to other characters at a similar level of experience.[12] A player may gimp a character by assigning skills and abilities that are inappropriate for the character class, or by developing the character inefficiently.[13] However, this is not always the case, as some characters are purposely "gimped" by the game's developers in order to provide an incentive for raising their level, or, conversely, to give the player an early head-start. An example of this is Final Fantasy's Mystic Knight class, which starts out weak, but is able to become the most powerful class if brought to a very high level. Gimps may also be accidental on the part of the developer, and may require a software patch to rebalance. Sometimes, especially in MMORPGs, gimp is used as a synonym for nerf to describe a rule modification that weakens the affected target. Unlike the connotatively neutral term nerf[citation needed], gimp in this usage often implies that the rule change unfairly disadvantages the target.[14] A "nerf" is a change to a game that reduces the desirability or effectiveness of a particular game element. The term is also used as a verb for the act of making such a change.[15] The first established use of the term was in Ultima Online, as a reference to the NERF brand of toys which are soft and less likely to cause serious injury.[16][17] Among game developers, MMORPG designers are especially likely to nerf aspects of a game in order to maintain game balance. Occasionally a new feature (such as an item, class, or skill) may be made too powerful, too cheap, or too easily obtained to the extent that it unbalances the game system. This is sometimes due to an unforeseen bug or method of using or acquiring the object that was not considered by the developers.[16][18] The frequency of nerfing and the scale of nerfing vary widely from game to game but almost all massively multiplayer games have engaged in nerfing at some point.[18] Nerfs in various online games, including Anarchy Online, have spurred in-world protests.[17] Since many items in virtual worlds are sold or traded among players, a nerf may have an outsized impact on the virtual economy. As players respond, the nerf may cause prices to fluctuate before settling down in a different equilibrium. This impact on the economy, along with the original impact of the nerf, can cause large player resentment for even a small change.[17][18] In particular, in the case of items or abilities which have been nerfed, players can become upset over the perceived wasted efforts in obtaining the now nerfed features.[17][18] A well-known instance in which a nerf has caused many protests, but much more praise, is when Infinity Ward nerfed the Model 1887s in its video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Before the nerf, the Model 1887s were able to One Shot Kill from medium-long range when all other shotguns in game were limited to short-medium range. The nerfing of the Model 1887s reduced its range to short range. For games where avatars and items represent significant economic value, this may bring up legal issues over the lost value.[19] Overpowered (often abbreviated to OP) is a common term referring to a perceived lack of game balance. It is often used when describing a specific class in an RPG, a specific faction in strategic games, or a specific tactic, ability, weapon or unit in various games. For something to be deemed overpowered, it is either the best choice in a disproportionate number of situations (marginalising other choices) and/or excessively hard to counter by the opponent compared to the effort required to use it.

Content:
Konrad Bleuler (23 September 1912, Herzogenbuchsee  1 January 1992, Knigswinter) was a Swiss physicist who worked in the field of theoretical particle physics and quantum field theory.[1] He is known for his work on the quantisation of the photon, the GuptaBleuler formalism.[2] Bleuler was born in Herzogenbuchsee, Switzerland on 23 September 1912. He received his doctorate for the mathematical work titled "On the Rolle's theorem for the operator u + u and related properties of the Green's function" from the ETH Zurich in 1942. His thesis advisor was Michel Plancherel. From 1960 to 1980 he was a Professor at the University of Bonn, where he founded the Institute of Theoretical Nuclear Physics, which is now the Helmholtz Institute for Radiation and Nuclear Physics. Even after his retirement, he was active and remained there until his death. 1971 Bleuler organized the first "International Conference on Differential Geometric Methods in Theoretical Physics" and since then he had been organizing the conference regularly. The last one was the 19th Conference in 1990 held at Rapallo. In 1993, at the 22nd Conference in his honor a "Bleuler Medal" awarded.[2] Bleuler's most notable contribution was the introduction of GuptaBleuler formalism for the quantization of the electromagnetic field, which he developed independently with Suraj N. Gupta.[3] This was an important work on quantum electrodynamics. Bleuler also made contributions to nuclear and particle physics. He also wrote about the work of other famous scientists, so on Wolfgang Pauli[4] and Rolf Nevanlinna.

Difficulty selection is not always presented bluntly, particularly in competitive games where all players are affected equally and the standard "easy/hard" terminology no longer applies. Sometimes veiled language is used (Mario Kart offers "CC select"), while at other times there may be an array of granular settings instead of an overarching difficulty option. An alternative approach to difficulty levels is catering to players of all abilities at the same time, a technique that has been called "subjective difficulty".[6] This requires a game to provide multiple solutions or routes, each offering challenges appropriate to players of different skill levels (Super Mario Galaxy, Sonic Generations). Difficulty can also be managed by a third party or the game itself; see the Gamemaster section below. Balancing goals shift dramatically when players are contending with the game's environment and/or non-player characters. Such player versus environment games are usually balanced to tread the fine line of regularly challenging players' abilities without ever producing insurmountable or unfair obstacles.[4] This turns balancing into the management of dramatic structure,[3] generally referred to by game designers as "pacing". Pacing is also a consideration in competitive games, but the autonomy of players makes it harder to control. The simplest game balancing technique is giving each player identical resources. Most competitive games feature some level of symmetry; some (such as Pong) are completely symmetric, but those in which players alternate turns (such as Chess) can never achieve total symmetry as one player will always have a first-move advantage. Symmetry can be undone by human psychology. The advantage of players wearing red over players wearing blue is a well-documented example of this.[7][8] The brute force approach to balancing is the mathematical analysis of game session results. With enough data, it is possible to identify unbalanced areas of a game and make corrections. Randomisation of starting conditions is a technique common in board games, card games, and also experimental research[9] which fights back against the human tendency to optimise patterns in one's favour.[2] The downside of randomisation is that it takes control away from the player, potentially leading to frustration. Methods of overcoming this include giving the player a selection of random results within which they can optimise (Scrabble, Magic: The Gathering) and making each game session short enough to encourage multiple attempts in one play session (Klondike (solitaire), Strange Adventures in Infinite Space). Many games become more challenging if the player is successful. For instance, real-time strategy games often feature "upkeep", a resource tax that scales with the number of units under a player's control.[10] Team games which challenge players to invade their opponents' territory (football, capture the flag) have a feedback loop by default: the further a player pushes, the more opponents they are likely to face. Feedback loops can lead to frequent ties if enforced too strictly. See also Dynamic game difficulty balancing. A game can be balanced dynamically by a gamemaster who observes players and adjusts the game in response to their emotional state (Dungeons & Dragons, Left 4 Dead). Although gamemasters have historically been humans, some videogames now feature AI systems that perform a similar role by monitoring player ability and inferring emotional state from input.[4] Research into biofeedback peripherals is set to greatly improve the accuracy of such systems.[11] In role-playing game slang, a "gimp" is a character, character class or character ability that is underpowered in the context of the game. Gimped characters lack effectiveness compared to other characters at a similar level of experience.[12] A player may gimp a character by assigning skills and abilities that are inappropriate for the character class, or by developing the character inefficiently.[13] However, this is not always the case, as some characters are purposely "gimped" by the game's developers in order to provide an incentive for raising their level, or, conversely, to give the player an early head-start. An example of this is Final Fantasy's Mystic Knight class, which starts out weak, but is able to become the most powerful class if brought to a very high level. Gimps may also be accidental on the part of the developer, and may require a software patch to rebalance. Sometimes, especially in MMORPGs, gimp is used as a synonym for nerf to describe a rule modification that weakens the affected target. Unlike the connotatively neutral term nerf[citation needed], gimp in this usage often implies that the rule change unfairly disadvantages the target.[14] A "nerf" is a change to a game that reduces the desirability or effectiveness of a particular game element. The term is also used as a verb for the act of making such a change.[15] The first established use of the term was in Ultima Online, as a reference to the NERF brand of toys which are soft and less likely to cause serious injury.[16][17] Among game developers, MMORPG designers are especially likely to nerf aspects of a game in order to maintain game balance. Occasionally a new feature (such as an item, class, or skill) may be made too powerful, too cheap, or too easily obtained to the extent that it unbalances the game system. This is sometimes due to an unforeseen bug or method of using or acquiring the object that was not considered by the developers.[16][18] The frequency of nerfing and the scale of nerfing vary widely from game to game but almost all massively multiplayer games have engaged in nerfing at some point.[18] Nerfs in various online games, including Anarchy Online, have spurred in-world protests.[17] Since many items in virtual worlds are sold or traded among players, a nerf may have an outsized impact on the virtual economy. As players respond, the nerf may cause prices to fluctuate before settling down in a different equilibrium. This impact on the economy, along with the original impact of the nerf, can cause large player resentment for even a small change.[17][18] In particular, in the case of items or abilities which have been nerfed, players can become upset over the perceived wasted efforts in obtaining the now nerfed features.[17][18] A well-known instance in which a nerf has caused many protests, but much more praise, is when Infinity Ward nerfed the Model 1887s in its video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Before the nerf, the Model 1887s were able to One Shot Kill from medium-long range when all other shotguns in game were limited to short-medium range. The nerfing of the Model 1887s reduced its range to short range. For games where avatars and items represent significant economic value, this may bring up legal issues over the lost value.[19] Overpowered (often abbreviated to OP) is a common term referring to a perceived lack of game balance. It is often used when describing a specific class in an RPG, a specific faction in strategic games, or a specific tactic, ability, weapon or unit in various games. For something to be deemed overpowered, it is either the best choice in a disproportionate number of situations (marginalising other choices) and/or excessively hard to counter by the opponent compared to the effort required to use it.

Content:
Festus Walters (18491922) was an Ohio jurist and advocate for Gubernatorial judicial independence known for the controversial decision to try an Ohio National Guard commander for murder following the Washington County Courthouse riots of 1895. Among the Ohio Five arriving at Cornell University when that revolutionary institution opened its doors, he was life-long friends with fellow Cornellian and fraternity brother, Senator Joseph B. Foraker. In 1898, the official history of the Republican Party in Ohio stated that [t]he Republican party may well be judged by its degree of intelligence, its usefulness and safety in the management of public affairs, and its achievements during the forty years of its existence. It is a party of principle, and though its opponents may criticise its doctrines they cannot deny that it has always had the courage of its convictions. As long as it continues it will attract to its ranks men of brilliant minds and intellectual giants who give freely of their great gifts to aid the maintenance of a party that has done so much for the prosperity of the country. Ohio has in the past contributed her share of famous men, and as the years roll on the names of others are added one by one to the rapidly increasing list. One that has become prominently associated with the political history of the state is that of Judge Festus Walters . . . personally the Judge is courteous and affable, and is an excellent entertainer, though not a society man in the strict sense of the word.[1] Festus Walters descended in the maternal line from the Peters family of Fairfield, County, Ohio. It is unknown when the eponymous Peters ancestor landed in America, or from what country. Like many whose descendants settled southern Ohio, he settled in Philadelphia, married, and sired two sons born in Philadelphia, Jacob and Henry. Henry died without issue. Jacob married. He moved south to Baltimore, raising three sons and one daughter. The daughter married a man named Burns. The sons were John, Jacob and Samuel. Samuel, son of Jacob and the ancestor of Ohios Judge Festus Walters, was born in Philadelphia on September 27, 1772. He died at his home in Amanda township, Fairfield County, Ohio, September 10, 1829. His wife was Mary Stevenson, daughter of Daniel Stevenson, of Baltimore County, Maryland. She was born September 28, 1773, and died in Fairfield County, February 15, 1861, aged 87 years. Their oldest son, Henry Peters, was born October 1, 1796. They trekked to the Ohio valley in April, 1812, and lived for five years on what became the Frank Stevenson farm. Daniel Stevenson was born September 21, 1737 and died September 3, 1829. Ruth, his wife, was born January 24, 1743, and died January 12, 1834. They were the parents of ten children. They came to Ohio several years before Peters and his wife. The wife of Samuel Peters was a model woman and mother. She was a daughter of Daniel Stevenson, one of the early pioneers of Richland township, and on whose land the first Methodist church in the county was erected. The old homestead remained in the Stevenson family for many years. A grandson of Daniel was the landsman when Festus Walters was sitting on the Ohio bench. There were several brothers and sisters of the Stevenson family, Daniel, Jesse, Mordecai, Edward, Mrs. Peters  who was Judge Walters grandmother  and Mrs. Hampson were those most remembered; most of them were born in Maryland and came to Ohio with their father as early as 1803. Daniel Stevenson, the pioneer and father of this large family, was a very prominent man of the Republics early days and much respected for his sterling character. He was a Methodist and donated land for the first church in the county. He entertained the evangelist Bishop Asbury during his visits to Fairfield County, and it was on his land where Asbury conducted the first camp meeting held in the county. The early church was constructed of hewn logs, carved with big broad axes, and with a skill available to a select few of the pioneer workman, and with what skill the corner men could notch the logs perfectly, and carry up their corner, a perilous job, but performed by hundreds of men. With respect to the Peters family, Mr. Peters and wife arrived in the Ohio valley in 1812. They settled two miles north of West Rushville, on Rush Creek, at the mouth of Snake run. The Peters remained on Rush Creek for about five years. They purchased land south of Royalton later owned by Benjamin Haas, cut a farm and endured the hardships incidental to pioneer life. Here they spent their lives, living the quiet life of farmers and rearing a large family of children. Mr. Peters was a man of sterling character and possessed good business sense. Peters was prominent and beloved in his neighborhood, and exerted an influence in the community far above the average. His success in rearing a large family to honorable and useful lives, is evidence of many good qualities and ability as a parent. His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921. At the close of his second term, Robert Z. Buchwalter, son of his fraternity brother, Judge Morris Lyons Buchwalter, was elected to serve on the First Circuit for a term starting February 9, 1921.[8] The year after Judge Walters stepped down from the bench, he died. His judicial career included long sessions on the Court of Common Pleas, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Appeals.

Daniele Matias Hyplito (born September 8, 1984) is a Brazilian gymnast who competed in the 2000, 2004 and 2008 Summer Olympics. Hyplito was the first athlete from Brazil ever to win a medal at the World Championships, a silver on floor exercise in 2001.[1] She is also the nine-time senior all-around Brazilian National Champion in artistic gymnastics, 2002 South American Games all-around champion and 2003 Pan American Games all-around bronze medalist. To date Hyplito has represented Brazil at the World Championships seven times, competing in every Worlds meet from 1999 to 2007, as well as the 1999, 2003 and 2007 Pan American Games. Hyplito was born in Santo Andr, So Paulo to parents Wagner and Geni.[1] Her younger brother, Diego, is also a world-class gymnast. In 2005 he became the first male Brazilian gymnast to win a World Championships medal, earning gold on the floor exercise. Training in Rio de Janeiro, Hyplito was competing internationally by the time she was 10 years old. As a junior, she won the all-around in the Junior Pan Am Games in 1998 and the Canberra Cup in 1999. Hyplito placed a modest 27th in the all-around at the 1999 World Gymnastics Championships, but helped Brazil qualify athletes to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. She was chosen to represent Brazil at the Olympics and qualified for the all-around final, finishing in 20th place.[1] In 2001, Hyplito made dramatic improvements. At that year's World Championships, she placed fourth in the all-around, scoring 9.056 on vault, 8.912 on bars, 9.375 on beam and 9.562 on floor. Until Jade Barbosa's bronze medal win at the 2007 World Championships, this placement was the highest AA finish ever achieved by a Brazilian gymnast in Worlds or Olympic competition. Hyplito followed up her strong AA showing by winning Brazil's first ever gymnastics medal, a silver, in the floor exercise event final (9.487). She continued to do well in 2002, winning the all-around and every event final gold except uneven bars at the South American Games and placing 5th on floor at the World Championships (9.237). At the 2003 World Championships Hyplito placed last in the all-around after injuring herself on her first event, however, she helped Brazil qualify a full team for the 2004 Olympics. At the Olympics, Hyplito competed well, helping the Brazilian team to a ninth place finish and placing 12th in the all-around. Hyplito placed 9th in the all-around at the 2005 World Championships. In 2006 she won her ninth national championships. She also won the silver medal on balance beam at the 2006 World Cup Finals, one of the major events on the FIG calendar, that took place in So Paulo, Brazil. In 2007, Hyplito placed second in the all-around at the Brazilian National Championships and won the floor exercise title. She was a member of the silver medal-winning Brazilian team at the 2007 Pan American Games, where she placed 5th in the all-around and won a bronze medal on beam. She scored 15.375, while the silver-medalist Nastia Liukin got 15.9 and the gold-medalist, Shawn, scored 16.15.[2] She also participated in the 2007 World Championships, where she helped the Brazilian team to its highest placing ever, fifth in the team finals. She also competed at the 2007 Arthur Gander Memorial Cup in Switzerland, where she placed 4th all-around and won a bronze medal on floor. In 2008, Hyplito left the National Training Center in Curitiba to return to her home club, Flamengo, in Rio de Janeiro.[3] At the 2008 Brazilian National Championships, she placed first on the balance beam, second on floor, and third in the all-around and vault.[4] At the Olympics, Hyplito competed on three eventsbars, beam and floor exercisein the preliminary round of competition.[5] In the team finals, she competed on balance beam and uneven bars, contributing scores of 14.925 and 14.625 to the Brazilian team's 8th place finish.[6] In 2010, back to important competitions, she competed in 2010 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. She placed 18th in All Around Final and 10th in team final. In 2011, Daniele helped Brazilian team to place 14th in 2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. She also improved her individual result, placing 13th in All Around Final. In 2011 Pan American Games, Daniele won two bronze medals: on floor (13.75) and on beam (13.75). She placed 5th in Team Competition (behind USA, Canada, Mexico and Colombia) and 7th in All Around Comepetition. [1] In 2012, her first competition was in 2012 Gymnastics Olympic Test Event. She helped Brazilian Team to qualify in 4th for the 2012 Olympic Games. In the event finals, she scored 14.066 on vault and placed fourth. Her teammate Jade Barbosa won the gold. On floor, she received 13.733 and was 8th. Vanessa Ferrari was the champion. [2].

The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B.

Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican.

His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other.

Content:
Kokkola (Swedish: Karleby) is a town and municipality of Finland. The town is located in the province of Western Finland and is part of the Central Ostrobothnia region. The town has a population of 46,602 (31 January 2012)[2] and covers an area of 2,730.81 square kilometres (1,054.37sqmi) of which 1,286.61km2 (496.76sqmi) is water.[1] The population density is 32.27 inhabitants per square kilometre (83.6/sqmi). The municipality is bilingual with 84.2% being Finnish and 13.9% Swedish speakers. The Finnish name Kokkola means "place of bonfire" or "place of eagle" because the Finnish root word kokko means both bonfire and white-tailed eagle (the suffix -la denotes location). The town was known in Swedish by the name Gamlakarleby until 1 January 1977 when the surrounding land municipality of Kaarlela (Swedish: Karleby) was consolidated with Kokkola, and the town took over the Swedish name of Karleby. The word gamla means "old", karl means "man" or "peasant" and by means "village", in tearn literally meaning '"old village of peasants" or Anglicised as "Old Peasantville". The Latin name was Carolina Vetus. Results of the Finnish parliamentary election, 2011 in Kokkola: Kokkola is located on the coast of Gulf of Bothnia, and the coastal European route E8 (Finnish highway 8) goes through, connecting Oulu and Turku via Vaasa. Finnish highway 28 begins from Kokkola and runs to Kajaani. Finnish highway 13 begins from Kokkola and runs through Finland into the Nuijamaa border crossing via Jyvskyl and Mikkeli. The scenic '7 Bridges Archipelago Road' (road 749) runs along the coast between Kokkola and Jakobstad. Kokkola-Pietarsaari Airport is situated 22 kilometres (14mi) from Kokkola in Kronoby (Finnish: Kruunupyy). The Kokkola railway station is a stop along Line 7, with service between Helsinki and Kemijrvi via Tampere and Seinjoki, where the fast Pendolino bullet train operates. There is no passenger ferry traffic from Kokkola. The town of Kokkola was chartered in 1620 by king Gustav II Adolf of Sweden, when Finland was a part of the Swedish Empire. Kokkola was founded as a shipping port for the tar trade. It also became an important shipbuilding centre in Finland. As a result of tar trade and shipbuilding industry Kokkola was for a time the richest town in Finland.[citation needed] An interesting historical affair, known as the Skirmish of Halkokari, occurred at the town of Kokkola in June 1854 during the Crimean War. Royal Marines from HMS Vulture and HMS Odin tried to come ashore to ransack the town, but were repelled by local defenders, of which many were civilians armed with hunting rifles. One of the 9 smaller British craft (a gunboat) fell into the hands of the defenders. As such, this boat was the only Royal Navy vessel still in foreign possession in 1914. The boat is still today a museum-object and can be seen in Kokkola's English Park. The town council has refused to return the boat despite several requests by the United Kingdom, most recently by John Stuttard, the Lord Mayor of London. The British Treasury annually pays a small sum for the maintenance of nine graves of nine Royal Marines killed in action during the skirmish to the local church congregation.[6] The city had a Swedish-speaking majority until 1933. In 1977, the surrounding municipality of Kaarlela (Swedish: Karleby) was consolidated into Kokkola (Swedish until then: Gamlakarleby). In 2009, the municipalities of Lohtaja, Klvi and Ullava were consolidated with Kokkola. Kokkola is the capital and only city in the region of Central Ostrobothnia. The chemical industry is a major employer. An industrial area and a port is located in Ykspihlaja. OMG has a cobalt plant and Boliden has a zinc plant in there. Kemira, a chemical conglomerate, built an industrial park that is now divided between several corporations. The area has Kemira's own sulfuric acid plant, a Kemira GrowHow site, KemFine's fine chemicals plant, Tetra Chemicals calcium chloride plant and a Nordkalk plant. In addition, industries represented in the town include metalworking, casting, textiles, plastics, food and carpentry. Largest employers are as follows:[7] The port of Kokkola is located in Ykspihlaja, approximately 5km (3mi) from the city center, and it is one of the busiest ports in Finland. Oil, ore and limestone are imported, refined products and timber are exported, and iron ore is transited.

ÿ6,602 (31 January 2012)[2] and covers an area of 2,730.81 square kilometres (1,054.37sqmi) of which 1,286.61km2 (496.76sqmi) is water.[1] The population density is 32.27 inhabitants per square kilometre (83.6/sqmi). The municipality is bilingual with 84.2% being Finnish and 13.9% Swedish speakers. The Finnish name Kokkola means "place of bonfire" or "place of eagle" because the Finnish root word kokko means both bonfire and white-tailed eagle (the suffix -la denotes location). The town was known in Swedish by the name Gamlakarleby until 1 January 1977 when the surrounding land municipality of Kaarlela (Swedish: Karleby) was consolidated with Kokkola, and the town took over the Swedish name of Karleby. The word gamla means "old", karl means "man" or "peasant" and by means "village", in tearn literally meaning '"old village of peasants" or Anglicised as "Old Peasantville". The Latin name was Carolina Vetus. Results of the Finnish parliamentary election, 2011 in Kokkola: Kokkola is located on the coast of Gulf of Bothnia, and the coastal European route E8 (Finnish highway 8) goes through, connecting Oulu and Turku via Vaasa. Finnish highway 28 begins from Kokkola and runs to Kajaani. Finnish highway 13 begins from Kokkola and runs through Finland into the Nuijamaa border crossing via Jyvskyl and Mikkeli. The scenic '7 Bridges Archipelago Road' (road 749) runs along the coast between Kokkola and Jakobstad. Kokkola-Pietarsaari Airport is situated 22 kilometres (14mi) from Kokkola in Kronoby (Finnish: Kruunupyy). The Kokkola railway station is a stop along Line 7, with service between Helsinki and Kemijrvi via Tampere and Seinjoki, where the fast Pendolino bullet train operates. There is no passenger ferry traffic from Kokkola. The town of Kokkola was chartered in 1620 by king Gustav II Adolf of Sweden, when Finland was a part of the Swedish Empire. Kokkola was founded as a shipping port for the tar trade. It also became an important shipbuilding centre in Finland. As a result of tar trade and shipbuilding industry Kokkola was for a time the richest town in Finland.[citation needed] An interesting historical affair, known as the Skirmish of Halkokari, occurred at the town of Kokkola in June 1854 during the Crimean War. Royal Marines from HMS Vulture and HMS Odin tried to come ashore to ransack the town, but were repelled by local defenders, of which many were civilians armed with hunting rifles. One of the 9 smaller British craft (a gunboat) fell into the hands of the defenders. As such, this boat was the only Royal Navy vessel still in foreign possession in 1914. The boat is still today a museum-object and can be seen in Kokkola's English Park. The town council has refused to return the boat despite several requests by the United Kingdom, most recently by John Stuttard, the Lord Mayor of London. The British Treasury annually pays a small sum for the maintenance of nine graves of nine Royal Marines killed in action during the skirmish to the local church congregation.[6] The city had a Swedish-speaking majority until 1933. In 1977, the surrounding municipality of Kaarlela (Swedish: Karleby) was consolidated into Kokkola (Swedish until then: Gamlakarleby). In 2009, the municipalities of Lohtaja, Klvi and Ullava were consolidated with Kokkola. Kokkola is the capital and only city in the region of Central Ostrobothnia. The chemical industry is a major employer. An industrial area and a port is located in Ykspihlaja. OMG has a cobalt plant and Boliden has a zinc plant in there. Kemira, a chemical conglomerate, built an industrial park that is now divided between several corporations. The area has Kemira's own sulfuric acid plant, a Kemira GrowHow site, KemFine's fine chemicals plant, Tetra Chemicals calcium chloride plant and a Nordkalk plant. In addition, industries represented in the town include metalworking, casting, textiles, plastics, food and carpentry. Largest employers are as follows:[7] The port of Kokkola is located in Ykspihlaja, approximately 5km (3mi) from the city center, and it is one of the busiest ports in Finland. Oil, ore and limestone are imported, refined products and timber are exported, and iron ore is transited.

ÿr above the average. His success in rearing a large family to honorable and useful lives, is evidence of many good qualities and ability as a parent. His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state.

"Brothers & Sisters" is a song by Coldplay, released as their first single in 1999 following the release of the bands first EP Safety, released a year earlier. It was later re-released as an EP. After forming in 1998, Coldplay met up with local record label Fierce Panda Records after a representative from said label saw them perform at the Camden Falcon in December of that year. Fierce Panda offered to release their debut single, and the band agreed, signing a short record deal.[1][2] 1,500 copies of the vinyl single were issued in a special wraparound picture sleeve. It peaked at #107 on the UK Singles Chart. According to the singles liner notes, recording completed in only four days and cost the band a lowly sum of 400.[1] The atmospheric sounds on "Easy to Please" were created by setting up microphones on a wet road outside the studio.[2] A new version of "Brothers & Sisters" later appeared on the "Trouble" single. The single was re-released as an EP in late 2002 on Brash Records.

Kokkola-Pietarsaari Airport is situated 22 kilometres (14mi) from Kokkola in Kronoby (Finnish: Kruunupyy). The Kokkola railway station is a stop along Line 7, with service between Helsinki and Kemijrvi via Tampere and Seinjoki, where the fast Pendolino bullet train operates. There is no passenger ferry traffic from Kokkola. The town of Kokkola was chartered in 1620 by king Gustav II Adolf of Sweden, when Finland was a part of the Swedish Empire. Kokkola was founded as a shipping port for the tar trade. It also became an important shipbuilding centre in Finland. As a result of tar trade and shipbuilding industry Kokkola was for a time the richest town in Finland.[citation needed] An interesting historical affair, known as the Skirmish of Halkokari, occurred at the town of Kokkola in June 1854 during the Crimean War. Royal Marines from HMS Vulture and HMS Odin tried to come ashore to ransack the town, but were repelled by local defenders, of which many were civilians armed with hunting rifles. One of the 9 smaller British craft (a gunboat) fell into the hands of the defenders. As such, this boat was the only Royal Navy vessel still in foreign possession in 1914. The boat is still today a museum-object and can be seen in Kokkola's English Park. The town council has refused to return the boat despite several requests by the United Kingdom, most recently by John Stuttard, the Lord Mayor of London. The British Treasury annually pays a small sum for the maintenance of nine graves of nine Royal Marines killed in action during the skirmish to the local church congregation.[6] The city had a Swedish-speaking majority until 1933. In 1977, the surrounding municipality of Kaarlela (Swedish: Karleby) was consolidated into Kokkola (Swedish until then: Gamlakarleby). In 2009, the municipalities of Lohtaja, Klvi and Ullava were consolidated with Kokkola. Kokkola is the capital and only city in the region of Central Ostrobothnia. The chemical industry is a major employer. An industrial area and a port is located in Ykspihlaja. OMG has a cobalt plant and Boliden has a zinc plant in there. Kemira, a chemical conglomerate, built an industrial park that is now divided between several corporations. The area has Kemira's own sulfuric acid plant, a Kemira GrowHow site, KemFine's fine chemicals plant, Tetra Chemicals calcium chloride plant and a Nordkalk plant. In addition, industries represented in the town include metalworking, casting, textiles, plastics, food and carpentry. Largest employers are as follows:[7] The port of Kokkola is located in Ykspihlaja, approximately 5km (3mi) from the city center, and it is one of the busiest ports in Finland. Oil, ore and limestone are imported, refined products and timber are exported, and iron ore is transited.

ÿr above the average. His success in rearing a large family to honorable and useful lives, is evidence of many good qualities and ability as a parent. His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921. At the close of his second term, Robert Z. Buchwalter, son of his fraternity brother, Judge Morris Lyons Buchwalter, was elected to serve on the First Circuit for a term starting February 9, 1921.[8] The year after Judge Walters stepped down from the bench, he died. His judicial career included long sessions on the Court of Common Pleas, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Appeals.

Subject: Mansi language 
To: April
Content:
The Mansi language (also Vogul, although this is obsolete, and "Maansi") is a language of the Mansi people. It is spoken in territories of Russia along the Ob River and its tributaries, including the KhantyMansi Autonomous Okrug and the Sverdlovsk Oblast. According to the 1989 census, there were 3,184 Mansi-speaking people in Russia. The base dialect of the Mansi literary language is the Sosva dialect, a representative of the northern dialect; the discussion below is based on the standard language. Fixed word order is typical in Mansi. Adverbials and participles play an important role in sentence construction. The written language was first published in 1868 and in 1937 was revised using a form of Cyrillic. The Mansi language is subdivided into four main dialects which are to a large degree mutually unintelligible, and therefore best considered four languages. Northern Mansi (Sosva, Upper Lozyvin) has strong Russian, Komi, Nenets, and Northern Khanty influence. There is no accusative case; that is, both the nominative and accusative roles are unmarked on the noun. *// and *// have been backed to [a] and [a]. Western Mansi (Pelym, Vagily, Middle and Lower Lazyvin) went extinct ca. 2000. It had strong Russian and Komi influences. Long vowels were diphthongized. Eastern Mansi (Kondin) is spoken by 100200 people. It has Khanty and Tatar influence. There is vowel harmony, and for *// it has [], frequently diphthongized. Southern Mansi (Tavdin) went extinct ca. 1900. It had vowel harmony and a strong Tatar influence and displayed several archaisms such as retention of /y/ (elsewhere merged with *//), /ts/ (elsewhere deaffricated to /s/), and /a/ (elsewhere raised to /o/). The first publication of the written Mansi language was a translation of the Gospel of Matthew published in London in 1868. In 1932 a version of Latin alphabet was introduced with little success. The former Latin alphabet: In 1937, Cyrillic replaced the Latin. Mansi is an agglutinating, SOV language.[2] There are two articles in Mansi: definite  (a), which also means "now" when placed before verbs, and indefinite  (ak), literally "one".[3] There is no grammatical gender. Mansi distinguishes between singular, dual and plural number. Six grammatical cases exist. Possession is expressed using possessive suffixes, for example -, which means "my". Example with:  /put/ (cauldron) Missing cases can be expressed using postpositions, such as  (alnl, 'of, out of'),  (sait, 'after, behind'), etc. Mansi conjugation has three persons, three numbers, two tenses, and four moods. Active and passive voices exist. Intransitive and transitive conjugations are distinguished. This means that there are two possible ways of conjugating a verb. When the speaker conjugates in intransitive, the sentence has no concrete object (in this case, the object is nothing or something like something, anything). In the transitive conjugation, there is a concrete object. This feature also exists in the other Ugric languages. Mansi uses suffixes to express the tense. The tense suffix precedes the personal suffix. The language has no future tense; the future is expressed in other ways. There are four moods: indicative, conditional, imperative and precative. Indicative mood has no suffix. Imperative mood exists only in the second person. The suffixes are the following: Thus, the conjugation of the verb  (lat. mina [go]), in past tense (remember the suffix -): Verbs have active and passive voice. Active voice has no suffix; the suffix to express the passive is --. Verbal prefixes are used to modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways. For example, with the prefix - (el-) (away, off) the verb  (mina) (go) becomes  (elmina), which means to go away. This is surprisingly close to the Hungarian equivalents: el- (away) and menni (to go), where elmenni is to go away l(a)  'forwards, onwards, away' ot  'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity' Numbers 1 and 2 also have attributive forms:  (1) and  (2); compare with Hungarian kt, and Old Hungarian "kit").    .  I went fishing (literally "I fish catch went"). Here are some invented sentences in Northern Mansi (IPA transcription) and Hungarian. They demonstrate well the relationship between Hungarian and Mansi.

ÿr above the average. His success in rearing a large family to honorable and useful lives, is evidence of many good qualities and ability as a parent. His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921. At the close of his second term, Robert Z. Buchwalter, son of his fraternity brother, Judge Morris Lyons Buchwalter, was elected to serve on the First Circuit for a term starting February 9, 1921.[8] The year after Judge Walters stepped down from the bench, he died. His judicial career included long sessions on the Court of Common Pleas, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Appeals.

ÿributaries, including the KhantyMansi Autonomous Okrug and the Sverdlovsk Oblast. According to the 1989 census, there were 3,184 Mansi-speaking people in Russia. The base dialect of the Mansi literary language is the Sosva dialect, a representative of the northern dialect; the discussion below is based on the standard language. Fixed word order is typical in Mansi. Adverbials and participles play an important role in sentence construction. The written language was first published in 1868 and in 1937 was revised using a form of Cyrillic. The Mansi language is subdivided into four main dialects which are to a large degree mutually unintelligible, and therefore best considered four languages. Northern Mansi (Sosva, Upper Lozyvin) has strong Russian, Komi, Nenets, and Northern Khanty influence. There is no accusative case; that is, both the nominative and accusative roles are unmarked on the noun. *// and *// have been backed to [a] and [a]. Western Mansi (Pelym, Vagily, Middle and Lower Lazyvin) went extinct ca. 2000. It had strong Russian and Komi influences. Long vowels were diphthongized. Eastern Mansi (Kondin) is spoken by 100200 people. It has Khanty and Tatar influence. There is vowel harmony, and for *// it has [], frequently diphthongized. Southern Mansi (Tavdin) went extinct ca. 1900. It had vowel harmony and a strong Tatar influence and displayed several archaisms such as retention of /y/ (elsewhere merged with *//), /ts/ (elsewhere deaffricated to /s/), and /a/ (elsewhere raised to /o/). The first publication of the written Mansi language was a translation of the Gospel of Matthew published in London in 1868. In 1932 a version of Latin alphabet was introduced with little success. The former Latin alphabet: In 1937, Cyrillic replaced the Latin. Mansi is an agglutinating, SOV language.[2] There are two articles in Mansi: definite  (a), which also means "now" when placed before verbs, and indefinite  (ak), literally "one".[3] There is no grammatical gender. Mansi distinguishes between singular, dual and plural number. Six grammatical cases exist. Possession is expressed using possessive suffixes, for example -, which means "my". Example with:  /put/ (cauldron) Missing cases can be expressed using postpositions, such as  (alnl, 'of, out of'),  (sait, 'after, behind'), etc. Mansi conjugation has three persons, three numbers, two tenses, and four moods. Active and passive voices exist. Intransitive and transitive conjugations are distinguished. This means that there are two possible ways of conjugating a verb. When the speaker conjugates in intransitive, the sentence has no concrete object (in this case, the object is nothing or something like something, anything). In the transitive conjugation, there is a concrete object. This feature also exists in the other Ugric languages. Mansi uses suffixes to express the tense. The tense suffix precedes the personal suffix. The language has no future tense; the future is expressed in other ways. There are four moods: indicative, conditional, imperative and precative. Indicative mood has no suffix. Imperative mood exists only in the second person. The suffixes are the following: Thus, the conjugation of the verb  (lat. mina [go]), in past tense (remember the suffix -): Verbs have active and passive voice. Active voice has no suffix; the suffix to express the passive is --. Verbal prefixes are used to modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways. For example, with the prefix - (el-) (away, off) the verb  (mina) (go) becomes  (elmina), which means to go away. This is surprisingly close to the Hungarian equivalents: el- (away) and menni (to go), where elmenni is to go away l(a)  'forwards, onwards, away' ot  'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity' Numbers 1 and 2 also have attributive forms:  (1) and  (2); compare with Hungarian kt, and Old Hungarian "kit").    .  I went fishing (literally "I fish catch went"). Here are some invented sentences in Northern Mansi (IPA transcription) and Hungarian. They demonstrate well the relationship between Hungarian and Mansi.

He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921. At the close of his second term, Robert Z. Buchwalter, son of his fraternity brother, Judge Morris Lyons Buchwalter, was elected to serve on the First Circuit for a term starting February 9, 1921.[8] The year after Judge Walters stepped down from the bench, he died. His judicial career included long sessions on the Court of Common Pleas, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Appeals.

Subject: Butler Transit Authority 
To: Lucine
Content:
Butler Transit Authority, operating as TheBus, is a public transportation service located in Butler, Pennsylvania. The goal of the service is to provide mass transit access for the central portion of the county. However, no bus routes run to the heavily suburbanized southern portion of the county. The Port Authority of Allegheny County provides several bus routes that terminate just south of the rapidly growing suburb of Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania (providing park and ride options), but no fixed bus lines traverse this area. The agency does not provides its own commuter access to Pittsburgh. Instead, the private Myers Coach Lines is in charge of this service on weekdays and coordinates its stops with the transit authority. The Pittsburgh service also travels to a 35 space park and ride lot in Penn Township.

ÿMansi (Sosva, Upper Lozyvin) has strong Russian, Komi, Nenets, and Northern Khanty influence. There is no accusative case; that is, both the nominative and accusative roles are unmarked on the noun. *// and *// have been backed to [a] and [a]. Western Mansi (Pelym, Vagily, Middle and Lower Lazyvin) went extinct ca. 2000. It had strong Russian and Komi influences. Long vowels were diphthongized. Eastern Mansi (Kondin) is spoken by 100200 people. It has Khanty and Tatar influence. There is vowel harmony, and for *// it has [], frequently diphthongized. Southern Mansi (Tavdin) went extinct ca. 1900. It had vowel harmony and a strong Tatar influence and displayed several archaisms such as retention of /y/ (elsewhere merged with *//), /ts/ (elsewhere deaffricated to /s/), and /a/ (elsewhere raised to /o/). The first publication of the written Mansi language was a translation of the Gospel of Matthew published in London in 1868. In 1932 a version of Latin alphabet was introduced with little success. The former Latin alphabet: In 1937, Cyrillic replaced the Latin. Mansi is an agglutinating, SOV language.[2] There are two articles in Mansi: definite  (a), which also means "now" when placed before verbs, and indefinite  (ak), literally "one".[3] There is no grammatical gender. Mansi distinguishes between singular, dual and plural number. Six grammatical cases exist. Possession is expressed using possessive suffixes, for example -, which means "my". Example with:  /put/ (cauldron) Missing cases can be expressed using postpositions, such as  (alnl, 'of, out of'),  (sait, 'after, behind'), etc. Mansi conjugation has three persons, three numbers, two tenses, and four moods. Active and passive voices exist. Intransitive and transitive conjugations are distinguished. This means that there are two possible ways of conjugating a verb. When the speaker conjugates in intransitive, the sentence has no concrete object (in this case, the object is nothing or something like something, anything). In the transitive conjugation, there is a concrete object. This feature also exists in the other Ugric languages. Mansi uses suffixes to express the tense. The tense suffix precedes the personal suffix. The language has no future tense; the future is expressed in other ways. There are four moods: indicative, conditional, imperative and precative. Indicative mood has no suffix. Imperative mood exists only in the second person. The suffixes are the following: Thus, the conjugation of the verb  (lat. mina [go]), in past tense (remember the suffix -): Verbs have active and passive voice. Active voice has no suffix; the suffix to express the passive is --. Verbal prefixes are used to modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways. For example, with the prefix - (el-) (away, off) the verb  (mina) (go) becomes  (elmina), which means to go away. This is surprisingly close to the Hungarian equivalents: el- (away) and menni (to go), where elmenni is to go away l(a)  'forwards, onwards, away' ot  'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity' Numbers 1 and 2 also have attributive forms:  (1) and  (2); compare with Hungarian kt, and Old Hungarian "kit").    .

ÿr above the average. His success in rearing a large family to honorable and useful lives, is evidence of many good qualities and ability as a parent. His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W.

Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921. At the close of his second term, Robert Z. Buchwalter, son of his fraternity brother, Judge Morris Lyons Buchwalter, was elected to serve on the First Circuit for a term starting February 9, 1921.[8] The year after Judge Walters stepped down from the bench, he died. His judicial career included long sessions on the Court of Common Pleas, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Appeals.

Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 150 (P. Oxy. 150 or P. Oxy. I 150) is a receipt, written in Greek and discovered in Oxyrhynchus. The manuscript was written on papyrus in the form of a sheet. The document was written on 7 October 590. Currently it is housed in the Egyptian Museum (10051) in Cairo.[1] The document is a receipt showing that Phoebammon, a butler, had paid 3.5 jars of wine "to the 14 bucellarii of Heracleopolis and Koma who had come on account of the fight..."[2] The measurements of the fragment are 63 by 322 mm.[2] It was discovered by Grenfell and Hunt in 1897 in Oxyrhynchus. The text was published by Grenfell and Hunt in 1898.[2] This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:Grenfell, B. P.; A. S. Hunt (1898). Oxyrhynchus Papyri I.

ÿansi (Pelym, Vagily, Middle and Lower Lazyvin) went extinct ca. 2000. It had strong Russian and Komi influences. Long vowels were diphthongized. Eastern Mansi (Kondin) is spoken by 100200 people. It has Khanty and Tatar influence. There is vowel harmony, and for *// it has [], frequently diphthongized. Southern Mansi (Tavdin) went extinct ca. 1900. It had vowel harmony and a strong Tatar influence and displayed several archaisms such as retention of /y/ (elsewhere merged with *//), /ts/ (elsewhere deaffricated to /s/), and /a/ (elsewhere raised to /o/). The first publication of the written Mansi language was a translation of the Gospel of Matthew published in London in 1868. In 1932 a version of Latin alphabet was introduced with little success. The former Latin alphabet: In 1937, Cyrillic replaced the Latin. Mansi is an agglutinating, SOV language.[2] There are two articles in Mansi: definite  (a), which also means "now" when placed before verbs, and indefinite  (ak), literally "one".[3] There is no grammatical gender. Mansi distinguishes between singular, dual and plural number. Six grammatical cases exist. Possession is expressed using possessive suffixes, for example -, which means "my". Example with:  /put/ (cauldron) Missing cases can be expressed using postpositions, such as  (alnl, 'of, out of'),  (sait, 'after, behind'), etc. Mansi conjugation has three persons, three numbers, two tenses, and four moods. Active and passive voices exist. Intransitive and transitive conjugations are distinguished. This means that there are two possible ways of conjugating a verb. When the speaker conjugates in intransitive, the sentence has no concrete object (in this case, the object is nothing or something like something, anything). In the transitive conjugation, there is a concrete object. This feature also exists in the other Ugric languages. Mansi uses suffixes to express the tense. The tense suffix precedes the personal suffix. The language has no future tense; the future is expressed in other ways. There are four moods: indicative, conditional, imperative and precative. Indicative mood has no suffix. Imperative mood exists only in the second person. The suffixes are the following: Thus, the conjugation of the verb  (lat. mina [go]), in past tense (remember the suffix -): Verbs have active and passive voice. Active voice has no suffix; the suffix to express the passive is --. Verbal prefixes are used to modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways. For example, with the prefix - (el-) (away, off) the verb  (mina) (go) becomes  (elmina), which means to go away. This is surprisingly close to the Hungarian equivalents: el- (away) and menni (to go), where elmenni is to go away l(a)  'forwards, onwards, away' ot  'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity' Numbers 1 and 2 also have attributive forms:  (1) and  (2); compare with Hungarian kt, and Old Hungarian "kit").    .

His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s.

From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921. At the close of his second term, Robert Z. Buchwalter, son of his fraternity brother, Judge Morris Lyons Buchwalter, was elected to serve on the First Circuit for a term starting February 9, 1921.[8] The year after Judge Walters stepped down from the bench, he died. His judicial career included long sessions on the Court of Common Pleas, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Appeals.

ÿansi (Pelym, Vagily, Middle and Lower Lazyvin) went extinct ca. 2000. It had strong Russian and Komi influences. Long vowels were diphthongized. Eastern Mansi (Kondin) is spoken by 100200 people. It has Khanty and Tatar influence. There is vowel harmony, and for *// it has [], frequently diphthongized. Southern Mansi (Tavdin) went extinct ca. 1900. It had vowel harmony and a strong Tatar influence and displayed several archaisms such as retention of /y/ (elsewhere merged with *//), /ts/ (elsewhere deaffricated to /s/), and /a/ (elsewhere raised to /o/). The first publication of the written Mansi language was a translation of the Gospel of Matthew published in London in 1868. In 1932 a version of Latin alphabet was introduced with little success. The former Latin alphabet: In 1937, Cyrillic replaced the Latin. Mansi is an agglutinating, SOV language.[2] There are two articles in Mansi: definite  (a), which also means "now" when placed before verbs, and indefinite  (ak), literally "one".[3] There is no grammatical gender. Mansi distinguishes between singular, dual and plural number. Six grammatical cases exist. Possession is expressed using possessive suffixes, for example -, which means "my". Example with:  /put/ (cauldron) Missing cases can be expressed using postpositions, such as  (alnl, 'of, out of'),  (sait, 'after, behind'), etc. Mansi conjugation has three persons, three numbers, two tenses, and four moods. Active and passive voices exist. Intransitive and transitive conjugations are distinguished. This means that there are two possible ways of conjugating a verb. When the speaker conjugates in intransitive, the sentence has no concrete object (in this case, the object is nothing or something like something, anything). In the transitive conjugation, there is a concrete object. This feature also exists in the other Ugric languages. Mansi uses suffixes to express the tense. The tense suffix precedes the personal suffix. The language has no future tense; the future is expressed in other ways. There are four moods: indicative, conditional, imperative and precative. Indicative mood has no suffix. Imperative mood exists only in the second person. The suffixes are the following: Thus, the conjugation of the verb  (lat. mina [go]), in past tense (remember the suffix -): Verbs have active and passive voice. Active voice has no suffix; the suffix to express the passive is --. Verbal prefixes are used to modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways. For example, with the prefix - (el-) (away, off) the verb  (mina) (go) becomes  (elmina), which means to go away. This is surprisingly close to the Hungarian equivalents: el- (away) and menni (to go), where elmenni is to go away l(a)  'forwards, onwards, away' ot  'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity' Numbers 1 and 2 also have attributive forms:  (1) and  (2); compare with Hungarian kt, and Old Hungarian "kit").    .

ÿr above the average. His success in rearing a large family to honorable and useful lives, is evidence of many good qualities and ability as a parent. His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated.

ÿansi (Pelym, Vagily, Middle and Lower Lazyvin) went extinct ca. 2000. It had strong Russian and Komi influences. Long vowels were diphthongized. Eastern Mansi (Kondin) is spoken by 100200 people. It has Khanty and Tatar influence. There is vowel harmony, and for *// it has [], frequently diphthongized. Southern Mansi (Tavdin) went extinct ca. 1900. It had vowel harmony and a strong Tatar influence and displayed several archaisms such as retention of /y/ (elsewhere merged with *//), /ts/ (elsewhere deaffricated to /s/), and /a/ (elsewhere raised to /o/). The first publication of the written Mansi language was a translation of the Gospel of Matthew published in London in 1868. In 1932 a version of Latin alphabet was introduced with little success. The former Latin alphabet: In 1937, Cyrillic replaced the Latin. Mansi is an agglutinating, SOV language.[2] There are two articles in Mansi: definite  (a), which also means "now" when placed before verbs, and indefinite  (ak), literally "one".[3] There is no grammatical gender. Mansi distinguishes between singular, dual and plural number. Six grammatical cases exist. Possession is expressed using possessive suffixes, for example -, which means "my". Example with:  /put/ (cauldron) Missing cases can be expressed using postpositions, such as  (alnl, 'of, out of'),  (sait, 'after, behind'), etc. Mansi conjugation has three persons, three numbers, two tenses, and four moods. Active and passive voices exist. Intransitive and transitive conjugations are distinguished. This means that there are two possible ways of conjugating a verb. When the speaker conjugates in intransitive, the sentence has no concrete object (in this case, the object is nothing or something like something, anything). In the transitive conjugation, there is a concrete object. This feature also exists in the other Ugric languages. Mansi uses suffixes to express the tense. The tense suffix precedes the personal suffix. The language has no future tense; the future is expressed in other ways. There are four moods: indicative, conditional, imperative and precative. Indicative mood has no suffix. Imperative mood exists only in the second person. The suffixes are the following: Thus, the conjugation of the verb  (lat. mina [go]), in past tense (remember the suffix -): Verbs have active and passive voice. Active voice has no suffix; the suffix to express the passive is --. Verbal prefixes are used to modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways. For example, with the prefix - (el-) (away, off) the verb  (mina) (go) becomes  (elmina), which means to go away. This is surprisingly close to the Hungarian equivalents: el- (away) and menni (to go), where elmenni is to go away l(a)  'forwards, onwards, away' ot  'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity' Numbers 1 and 2 also have attributive forms:  (1) and  (2); compare with Hungarian kt, and Old Hungarian "kit").    .

ÿr above the average. His success in rearing a large family to honorable and useful lives, is evidence of many good qualities and ability as a parent. His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921. At the close of his second term, Robert Z. Buchwalter, son of his fraternity brother, Judge Morris Lyons Buchwalter, was elected to serve on the First Circuit for a term starting February 9, 1921.[8] The year after Judge Walters stepped down from the bench, he died. His judicial career included long sessions on the Court of Common Pleas, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Appeals.

Example with:  /put/ (cauldron) Missing cases can be expressed using postpositions, such as  (alnl, 'of, out of'),  (sait, 'after, behind'), etc. Mansi conjugation has three persons, three numbers, two tenses, and four moods. Active and passive voices exist. Intransitive and transitive conjugations are distinguished. This means that there are two possible ways of conjugating a verb. When the speaker conjugates in intransitive, the sentence has no concrete object (in this case, the object is nothing or something like something, anything). In the transitive conjugation, there is a concrete object. This feature also exists in the other Ugric languages. Mansi uses suffixes to express the tense. The tense suffix precedes the personal suffix. The language has no future tense; the future is expressed in other ways. There are four moods: indicative, conditional, imperative and precative. Indicative mood has no suffix. Imperative mood exists only in the second person. The suffixes are the following: Thus, the conjugation of the verb  (lat. mina [go]), in past tense (remember the suffix -): Verbs have active and passive voice. Active voice has no suffix; the suffix to express the passive is --. Verbal prefixes are used to modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways. For example, with the prefix - (el-) (away, off) the verb  (mina) (go) becomes  (elmina), which means to go away. This is surprisingly close to the Hungarian equivalents: el- (away) and menni (to go), where elmenni is to go away l(a)  'forwards, onwards, away' ot  'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity' Numbers 1 and 2 also have attributive forms:  (1) and  (2); compare with Hungarian kt, and Old Hungarian "kit").    .

His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921. At the close of his second term, Robert Z. Buchwalter, son of his fraternity brother, Judge Morris Lyons Buchwalter, was elected to serve on the First Circuit for a term starting February 9, 1921.[8] The year after Judge Walters stepped down from the bench, he died. His judicial career included long sessions on the Court of Common Pleas, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Appeals.

Content:
Ujaku Akita ( , Akita Ujaku?) was the pseudonym of Tokuz Akita ( , Akita Tokuz?) (30 January 1883  12 May 1962), a Japanese author and Esperantist. He is best known for his plays, books, and short stories for children. Born in Kuroishi, Aomori Prefecture, he studied English literature at Waseda University and became interested in socialism. In 1913 he learnt Esperanto from Vasili Eroshenko, as a result of a chance meeting, and soon became a leader of the proletarian Esperanto movement, and a member of the "La Semanto" group in 1921. He visited the USSR in 1927 for the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the revolution. In January 1931 he helped found the national organization, Japana Prolet-Esperantista Unio (JPEU), with about 150 members, and with Akita as president. He translated Eroshenko's writings into Japanese, and wrote a textbook on Esperanto. The rise of militarism in Japan led to difficulties for Akita; in the autumn of 1933 he was detained for several weeks, and forced to write a long statement about his activities.[1] Nevertheless he continued to work, founding a magazine the next year, Teatoro (named after the Esperanto word for theatre), which still exists.[2] He joined the New Cooperative Theatre (Shinky Gekidan) but its activities were limited because it was no longer safe to stage plays with political themes.[3] The JPEU was shut down by the police. After the war he established a performing arts school and was active in other organizations, such as the New Japan Literary Society (Shin Nihon Bungakukai). He died in 1962. A museum in his hometown was opened in 1979.

As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921. At the close of his second term, Robert Z. Buchwalter, son of his fraternity brother, Judge Morris Lyons Buchwalter, was elected to serve on the First Circuit for a term starting February 9, 1921.[8] The year after Judge Walters stepped down from the bench, he died. His judicial career included long sessions on the Court of Common Pleas, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Appeals.

Subject: Lactarius subtorminosus 
To: Caleb
Content:
Lactarius subtorminosus is a member of the "milk-cap" genus Lactarius in the order Russulales. Described as new to science by William Chambers Coker in 1918, it is known from North America. The whitish to cream-colored cap reaches 56 cm (2.02.4 in) in diameter and is tomentose, with margins folded inward. The gills are packed closely together, and are cream when mature. Gills that are cut will first turn pink then light brown. The stem is about 1.5cm (0.6in) long and 1.11.5 cm (0.40.6 in) thick, white overall with a few cream dots, and covered with a dense layer of small hairs. When cut or injured, the fruit bodies will ooze a sparse whitish latex with a taste similar to cypress wood. The spores are roughly spherical, warted, and measure 5.86.5 by 6.57m. Lactarius subtorminosus may be distinguised from the similar L.torminosus by its milder latex and smaller spores.[1]

Subject: Sabbath food preparation 
To: Keith
Content:
Sabbath food preparation refers to the preparation and handling of food on Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest, when cooking and the use of fire are prohibited by Jewish law. One of the 39 prohibited activities on the Sabbath is bishul (), or "cooking." However, bishul is not an exact equivalent of "cooking." The Hebrew term bishul as it relates to Shabbat is the "use of heat to alter the quality of an item,"[1] and this applies whether the heat is applied through baking, boiling, frying, roasting and most other types of cooking.[2][3] The prohibition of bishul applies to all types of food and drink, even to foods and drinks which are edible when raw or cold.[4] Kli Rishon A kli rishon ( , "first vessel") is a vessel that was heated directly on a flame or other source of heat. Even when removed from the source of heat, this vessel maintains its status as a kli rishon, and possesses the capacity to enact bishul on any type of food placed within it. This capacity remains until the pot and its contents cool below the temperature of yad soledet bo (  , the degree of heat "from which the hand recoils"). The prohibited activity of bishul is separate and distinct from that of havarah (, "kindling a fire"). Performing bishul with a pre-existing flame is forbidden on Shabbat The prohibition of bishul, however, is not limited to the use of fire as a heat source; it is forbidden to perform bishul with any source of heat, whether it be an actual flame, or an electric stove/range, a hot plate, an urn[5][6] or a microwave oven.[7] Moreover, placing food into a kli rishon may constitute bishul in certain instances. While it is prohibited in most instances to initially heat a food item to the temperature of yad soledet bo, foods that have already been fully cooked may sometimes be reheated. In terms of reheating, a distinction is made between dry foods and liquids. Dry food that has been completely cooked is no longer subject to the prohibition of bishul; this is based on the principle of ain bishul achar bishul (   , "Cooking does not take effect after cooking"). Thus, a completely cooked, dry food item, such as a piece of chicken or potato kugel, may be reheated once it has been fully cooked. However, there is a great dispute as to whether this rule applies to liquids: whereas Rashi,[8] the Rosh[9] and Rabbeinu Yonah[10] agree that this rule does not apply and reheating of liquids is forbidden, Maimonidies,[11] the Rashba and the Ran assert that liquids are in fact no different from solid dry foods. In practice, we are stringent and apply the principle of yeish bishul achar bishul (   , "Cooking does take effect after cooking"). This prohibition of reheating liquids, however, only applies when the liquid has completely cooled. If the liquid has only partially cooled and still retains enough heat to be enjoyed as the warm liquid as it was intended to be,[12] it may be reheated. The problem of preparing hot beverages on Shabbat revolves around the temperature of the water. If the water is hot enough to cook the tea leaves, it would constitute malacha. Pouring straight from an urn (also considered a klei rishon) would cause the cooking of the substance. For a solid substance the outer and concrete layer will definitely be cooked (bishul kdai klipah), which would be malacha. For a liquid there is no concrete layer, and therefore no specific part that is being cooked. Therefore it is ruled that a liquid is not considered cooked if it is not yad soledet bo or 113 degrees Fahrenheit. To bypass this problem we use a kos sheini. Using a Kos sheini is acceptable because when the liquid is poured (Erui kos sheini) some of the heat is transferred into the atmosphere, and therefore the liquid loses some heat. Most people hold that this will not cause enough heat to be emitted and therefore the tea leaves will still be cooked. To lower the temperature of the water further people rule that a klei shlishi must be used. Once again in the pouring process (erui klei sheini) more heat is emitted and therefore most people hold that the tea will not be cooked and it is therefore permissible to make tea with this water.[13]

Of the 2,132 who completed tertiary schooling, 31.4% were Swiss men, 26.9% were Swiss women, 22.2% were non-Swiss men and 19.5% were non-Swiss women.[7] During the 2009-2010 school year there were a total of 3,061 students in the Versoix school system. The education system in the Canton of Geneva allows young children to attend two years of non-obligatory Kindergarten.[20] During that school year, there were 200 children who were in a pre-kindergarten class. The canton's school system provides two years of non-mandatory kindergarten and requires students to attend six years of primary school, with some of the children attending smaller, specialized classes. In Versoix there were 413 students in kindergarten or primary school and 65 students were in the special, smaller classes. The secondary school program consists of three lower, obligatory years of schooling, followed by three to five years of optional, advanced schools. There were 413 lower secondary students who attended school in Versoix. There were 605 upper secondary students from the municipality along with 90 students who were in a professional, non-university track program. An additional 596 students attended a private school.[21] As of 2000[update], there were 1,082 students in Versoix who came from another municipality, while 688 residents attended schools outside the municipality.[19] Versoix is home to the Bibliothque Communale de Versoix library.[22] In Versoix there are four primary public schools:Ami-Argand, Bon Sjour, cole Lachenal and Monfleury. These schools go from Kindergarten to 6th grade. There is one public Middle school, the Collge des Colombires. This school goes from 7th to 9th grade. Students from Versoix, Genthod, Bellevue, Cligny, Chavannes-des-Bois and Crassier go to this school. There are no High Schools in Versoix, so the students have to go to Geneva. There is one private school Collge du Lman. The average annual temperature is 9C (48F) with an average annual rainfall of 930mm (36.6inches).

ÿd activities on the Sabbath is bishul (), or "cooking." However, bishul is not an exact equivalent of "cooking." The Hebrew term bishul as it relates to Shabbat is the "use of heat to alter the quality of an item,"[1] and this applies whether the heat is applied through baking, boiling, frying, roasting and most other types of cooking.[2][3] The prohibition of bishul applies to all types of food and drink, even to foods and drinks which are edible when raw or cold.[4] Kli Rishon A kli rishon ( , "first vessel") is a vessel that was heated directly on a flame or other source of heat. Even when removed from the source of heat, this vessel maintains its status as a kli rishon, and possesses the capacity to enact bishul on any type of food placed within it. This capacity remains until the pot and its contents cool below the temperature of yad soledet bo (  , the degree of heat "from which the hand recoils"). The prohibited activity of bishul is separate and distinct from that of havarah (, "kindling a fire"). Performing bishul with a pre-existing flame is forbidden on Shabbat The prohibition of bishul, however, is not limited to the use of fire as a heat source; it is forbidden to perform bishul with any source of heat, whether it be an actual flame, or an electric stove/range, a hot plate, an urn[5][6] or a microwave oven.[7] Moreover, placing food into a kli rishon may constitute bishul in certain instances. While it is prohibited in most instances to initially heat a food item to the temperature of yad soledet bo, foods that have already been fully cooked may sometimes be reheated. In terms of reheating, a distinction is made between dry foods and liquids. Dry food that has been completely cooked is no longer subject to the prohibition of bishul; this is based on the principle of ain bishul achar bishul (   , "Cooking does not take effect after cooking"). Thus, a completely cooked, dry food item, such as a piece of chicken or potato kugel, may be reheated once it has been fully cooked. However, there is a great dispute as to whether this rule applies to liquids: whereas Rashi,[8] the Rosh[9] and Rabbeinu Yonah[10] agree that this rule does not apply and reheating of liquids is forbidden, Maimonidies,[11] the Rashba and the Ran assert that liquids are in fact no different from solid dry foods. In practice, we are stringent and apply the principle of yeish bishul achar bishul (   , "Cooking does take effect after cooking"). This prohibition of reheating liquids, however, only applies when the liquid has completely cooled. If the liquid has only partially cooled and still retains enough heat to be enjoyed as the warm liquid as it was intended to be,[12] it may be reheated. The problem of preparing hot beverages on Shabbat revolves around the temperature of the water. If the water is hot enough to cook the tea leaves, it would constitute malacha. Pouring straight from an urn (also considered a klei rishon) would cause the cooking of the substance. For a solid substance the outer and concrete layer will definitely be cooked (bishul kdai klipah), which would be malacha. For a liquid there is no concrete layer, and therefore no specific part that is being cooked. Therefore it is ruled that a liquid is not considered cooked if it is not yad soledet bo or 113 degrees Fahrenheit. To bypass this problem we use a kos sheini. Using a Kos sheini is acceptable because when the liquid is poured (Erui kos sheini) some of the heat is transferred into the atmosphere, and therefore the liquid loses some heat. Most people hold that this will not cause enough heat to be emitted and therefore the tea leaves will still be cooked. To lower the temperature of the water further people rule that a klei shlishi must be used. Once again in the pouring process (erui klei sheini) more heat is emitted and therefore most people hold that the tea will not be cooked and it is therefore permissible to make tea with this water.[13]

Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) is a plant conservation charity based in London, England. It is a membership organisation, working with 800 botanic gardens in 118 countries, whose combined work forms the world's largest plant conservation network. Founded in 1987, BGCI is a registered charity in the United Kingdom,[1] and its members include the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, as two of its key supporters. The founder and director from 1987 to 1993 was Professor Vernon H Heywood. He was followed in 1994 by Dr. Peter Wyse Jackson (as Secretary-General) who led BGCI till 2005 when Sara Oldfield succeeded him. BGCI's patron is HRH Prince Charles, Prince of Wales. In 2007 its largely London-based staff numbered 17. Dedicated to plant conservation and environmental education, the charity works to support and promote the activities of its member gardens. Its official stated mission is to "mobilise botanic gardens and engage partners in securing plant diversity for the well-being of people and planet." As a global organisation BGCI has projects in a variety of different countries, with major ongoing projects in Argentina, Japan, China[2] (where half of the wild magnolias are threatened),[3] North America, the Middle East and Russia. Two of its major projects are the creation of on-line searchable databases listing the world's botanic gardens (Garden Search) and plants in cultivation among participating botanic gardens (Plant Search). On 18 January 2008, Botanic Gardens Conservation International (representing botanic gardens in 120 countries) stated that "400 medicinal plants are at risk of extinction, from over-collection and deforestation, threatening the discovery of future cures for disease." These included Yew trees (the bark is used for cancer drugs, paclitaxel); Hoodia (from Namibia, source of weight loss drugs); half of Magnolias (used as Chinese medicine for 5,000 years to fight cancer, dementia and heart disease); and Autumn crocus (for gout). The group also found that 5 billion people benefit from traditional plant-based medicine for health care.[4]

Of the 2,132 who completed tertiary schooling, 31.4% were Swiss men, 26.9% were Swiss women, 22.2% were non-Swiss men and 19.5% were non-Swiss women.[7] During the 2009-2010 school year there were a total of 3,061 students in the Versoix school system. The education system in the Canton of Geneva allows young children to attend two years of non-obligatory Kindergarten.[20] During that school year, there were 200 children who were in a pre-kindergarten class. The canton's school system provides two years of non-mandatory kindergarten and requires students to attend six years of primary school, with some of the children attending smaller, specialized classes. In Versoix there were 413 students in kindergarten or primary school and 65 students were in the special, smaller classes. The secondary school program consists of three lower, obligatory years of schooling, followed by three to five years of optional, advanced schools. There were 413 lower secondary students who attended school in Versoix.

ÿ(BGCI) is a plant conservation charity based in London, England. It is a membership organisation, working with 800 botanic gardens in 118 countries, whose combined work forms the world's largest plant conservation network. Founded in 1987, BGCI is a registered charity in the United Kingdom,[1] and its members include the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, as two of its key supporters. The founder and director from 1987 to 1993 was Professor Vernon H Heywood. He was followed in 1994 by Dr. Peter Wyse Jackson (as Secretary-General) who led BGCI till 2005 when Sara Oldfield succeeded him. BGCI's patron is HRH Prince Charles, Prince of Wales. In 2007 its largely London-based staff numbered 17. Dedicated to plant conservation and environmental education, the charity works to support and promote the activities of its member gardens. Its official stated mission is to "mobilise botanic gardens and engage partners in securing plant diversity for the well-being of people and planet." As a global organisation BGCI has projects in a variety of different countries, with major ongoing projects in Argentina, Japan, China[2] (where half of the wild magnolias are threatened),[3] North America, the Middle East and Russia. Two of its major projects are the creation of on-line searchable databases listing the world's botanic gardens (Garden Search) and plants in cultivation among participating botanic gardens (Plant Search). On 18 January 2008, Botanic Gardens Conservation International (representing botanic gardens in 120 countries) stated that "400 medicinal plants are at risk of extinction, from over-collection and deforestation, threatening the discovery of future cures for disease." These included Yew trees (the bark is used for cancer drugs, paclitaxel); Hoodia (from Namibia, source of weight loss drugs); half of Magnolias (used as Chinese medicine for 5,000 years to fight cancer, dementia and heart disease); and Autumn crocus (for gout). The group also found that 5 billion people benefit from traditional plant-based medicine for health care.[4]

ÿked. However, there is a great dispute as to whether this rule applies to liquids: whereas Rashi,[8] the Rosh[9] and Rabbeinu Yonah[10] agree that this rule does not apply and reheating of liquids is forbidden, Maimonidies,[11] the Rashba and the Ran assert that liquids are in fact no different from solid dry foods. In practice, we are stringent and apply the principle of yeish bishul achar bishul (   , "Cooking does take effect after cooking"). This prohibition of reheating liquids, however, only applies when the liquid has completely cooled. If the liquid has only partially cooled and still retains enough heat to be enjoyed as the warm liquid as it was intended to be,[12] it may be reheated. The problem of preparing hot beverages on Shabbat revolves around the temperature of the water. If the water is hot enough to cook the tea leaves, it would constitute malacha. Pouring straight from an urn (also considered a klei rishon) would cause the cooking of the substance. For a solid substance the outer and concrete layer will definitely be cooked (bishul kdai klipah), which would be malacha. For a liquid there is no concrete layer, and therefore no specific part that is being cooked. Therefore it is ruled that a liquid is not considered cooked if it is not yad soledet bo or 113 degrees Fahrenheit. To bypass this problem we use a kos sheini. Using a Kos sheini is acceptable because when the liquid is poured (Erui kos sheini) some of the heat is transferred into the atmosphere, and therefore the liquid loses some heat. Most people hold that this will not cause enough heat to be emitted and therefore the tea leaves will still be cooked. To lower the temperature of the water further people rule that a klei shlishi must be used. Once again in the pouring process (erui klei sheini) more heat is emitted and therefore most people hold that the tea will not be cooked and it is therefore permissible to make tea with this water.[13]

This has greatly helped not only Indian community to assimilate in America but also benefited countless[citation needed] causes in mainstream America. Chopra has also represented New York City Mayor and Comptroller and the two county executives on Long Island, New York at over three hundred functions over the past two decades welcoming such visitors as the Prime Minister of India, Federal Ministers, industrialists, ambassadors, consul generals, bishops, movie stars, and other people of significant achievements by presenting them with a key to the city, a flag of Nassau County, a citation or a proclamation to mark various events, achievements and celebrations.

He took up his first head professional position at Hamilton Golf Club in 1965. Two years later later returned to his home town to take up the same role at North Berwick Golf Club, where he remained until his retirement in 2009.[1] He was succeeded by his son, Martyn. As a club professional, Huish never followed a full time tournament career. Although he was regarded as a competent tournament player, it was not until The Open Championship in 1975 that he came to the attention of a wider audience. After qualifying for the championship in a seven man play-off, he shot rounds of 67 and 69 at Carnoustie to lead by two strokes over Tom Watson, Peter Oosterhuis and Bernard Gallacher at the halfway mark. However, he fell away over the weekend and ultimately finished 13 shots off the pace, in a tie for 32nd place.[2] His best finish in the Open came the following year at Birkdale, when he tied for 21st place. While Huish never won a top flight tour event, he did win many other tournaments, including the Scottish Uniroyal in 1971, and the Northern Open on four occasions. After turning 50, he joined the European Seniors Tour, where he enjoyed some success, claiming five victories, four of them in play-offs, with the last coming in 2001 when he won, again in a play-off, at the Bad Ragaz PGA Seniors Open in Switzerland. Huish later become a very significant and respected figure on the inside of professional golf, serving as the PGA Captain, a PGA Board Member and Ryder Cup Committee Member, a position he held longer than anyone else. In recognition of his achievements in the game, Huish received the Special Award at the Seniors Tour annual awards dinner in 2004 for services to golf.

ÿ[10] agree that this rule does not apply and reheating of liquids is forbidden, Maimonidies,[11] the Rashba and the Ran assert that liquids are in fact no different from solid dry foods. In practice, we are stringent and apply the principle of yeish bishul achar bishul (   , "Cooking does take effect after cooking"). This prohibition of reheating liquids, however, only applies when the liquid has completely cooled. If the liquid has only partially cooled and still retains enough heat to be enjoyed as the warm liquid as it was intended to be,[12] it may be reheated. The problem of preparing hot beverages on Shabbat revolves around the temperature of the water. If the water is hot enough to cook the tea leaves, it would constitute malacha. Pouring straight from an urn (also considered a klei rishon) would cause the cooking of the substance. For a solid substance the outer and concrete layer will definitely be cooked (bishul kdai klipah), which would be malacha. For a liquid there is no concrete layer, and therefore no specific part that is being cooked. Therefore it is ruled that a liquid is not considered cooked if it is not yad soledet bo or 113 degrees Fahrenheit. To bypass this problem we use a kos sheini. Using a Kos sheini is acceptable because when the liquid is poured (Erui kos sheini) some of the heat is transferred into the atmosphere, and therefore the liquid loses some heat. Most people hold that this will not cause enough heat to be emitted and therefore the tea leaves will still be cooked. To lower the temperature of the water further people rule that a klei shlishi must be used. Once again in the pouring process (erui klei sheini) more heat is emitted and therefore most people hold that the tea will not be cooked and it is therefore permissible to make tea with this water.[13]

Two years later later returned to his home town to take up the same role at North Berwick Golf Club, where he remained until his retirement in 2009.[1] He was succeeded by his son, Martyn. As a club professional, Huish never followed a full time tournament career. Although he was regarded as a competent tournament player, it was not until The Open Championship in 1975 that he came to the attention of a wider audience. After qualifying for the championship in a seven man play-off, he shot rounds of 67 and 69 at Carnoustie to lead by two strokes over Tom Watson, Peter Oosterhuis and Bernard Gallacher at the halfway mark. However, he fell away over the weekend and ultimately finished 13 shots off the pace, in a tie for 32nd place.[2] His best finish in the Open came the following year at Birkdale, when he tied for 21st place. While Huish never won a top flight tour event, he did win many other tournaments, including the Scottish Uniroyal in 1971, and the Northern Open on four occasions. After turning 50, he joined the European Seniors Tour, where he enjoyed some success, claiming five victories, four of them in play-offs, with the last coming in 2001 when he won, again in a play-off, at the Bad Ragaz PGA Seniors Open in Switzerland. Huish later become a very significant and respected figure on the inside of professional golf, serving as the PGA Captain, a PGA Board Member and Ryder Cup Committee Member, a position he held longer than anyone else.

ÿ[10] agree that this rule does not apply and reheating of liquids is forbidden, Maimonidies,[11] the Rashba and the Ran assert that liquids are in fact no different from solid dry foods. In practice, we are stringent and apply the principle of yeish bishul achar bishul (   , "Cooking does take effect after cooking"). This prohibition of reheating liquids, however, only applies when the liquid has completely cooled. If the liquid has only partially cooled and still retains enough heat to be enjoyed as the warm liquid as it was intended to be,[12] it may be reheated. The problem of preparing hot beverages on Shabbat revolves around the temperature of the water. If the water is hot enough to cook the tea leaves, it would constitute malacha. Pouring straight from an urn (also considered a klei rishon) would cause the cooking of the substance. For a solid substance the outer and concrete layer will definitely be cooked (bishul kdai klipah), which would be malacha. For a liquid there is no concrete layer, and therefore no specific part that is being cooked. Therefore it is ruled that a liquid is not considered cooked if it is not yad soledet bo or 113 degrees Fahrenheit. To bypass this problem we use a kos sheini. Using a Kos sheini is acceptable because when the liquid is poured (Erui kos sheini) some of the heat is transferred into the atmosphere, and therefore the liquid loses some heat. Most people hold that this will not cause enough heat to be emitted and therefore the tea leaves will still be cooked. To lower the temperature of the water further people rule that a klei shlishi must be used. Once again in the pouring process (erui klei sheini) more heat is emitted and therefore most people hold that the tea will not be cooked and it is therefore permissible to make tea with this water.[13]

ÿfull time tournament career. Although he was regarded as a competent tournament player, it was not until The Open Championship in 1975 that he came to the attention of a wider audience. After qualifying for the championship in a seven man play-off, he shot rounds of 67 and 69 at Carnoustie to lead by two strokes over Tom Watson, Peter Oosterhuis and Bernard Gallacher at the halfway mark. However, he fell away over the weekend and ultimately finished 13 shots off the pace, in a tie for 32nd place.[2] His best finish in the Open came the following year at Birkdale, when he tied for 21st place. While Huish never won a top flight tour event, he did win many other tournaments, including the Scottish Uniroyal in 1971, and the Northern Open on four occasions. After turning 50, he joined the European Seniors Tour, where he enjoyed some success, claiming five victories, four of them in play-offs, with the last coming in 2001 when he won, again in a play-off, at the Bad Ragaz PGA Seniors Open in Switzerland. Huish later become a very significant and respected figure on the inside of professional golf, serving as the PGA Captain, a PGA Board Member and Ryder Cup Committee Member, a position he held longer than anyone else.

ÿ[10] agree that this rule does not apply and reheating of liquids is forbidden, Maimonidies,[11] the Rashba and the Ran assert that liquids are in fact no different from solid dry foods. In practice, we are stringent and apply the principle of yeish bishul achar bishul (   , "Cooking does take effect after cooking"). This prohibition of reheating liquids, however, only applies when the liquid has completely cooled. If the liquid has only partially cooled and still retains enough heat to be enjoyed as the warm liquid as it was intended to be,[12] it may be reheated. The problem of preparing hot beverages on Shabbat revolves around the temperature of the water. If the water is hot enough to cook the tea leaves, it would constitute malacha. Pouring straight from an urn (also considered a klei rishon) would cause the cooking of the substance. For a solid substance the outer and concrete layer will definitely be cooked (bishul kdai klipah), which would be malacha. For a liquid there is no concrete layer, and therefore no specific part that is being cooked. Therefore it is ruled that a liquid is not considered cooked if it is not yad soledet bo or 113 degrees Fahrenheit. To bypass this problem we use a kos sheini. Using a Kos sheini is acceptable because when the liquid is poured (Erui kos sheini) some of the heat is transferred into the atmosphere, and therefore the liquid loses some heat. Most people hold that this will not cause enough heat to be emitted and therefore the tea leaves will still be cooked. To lower the temperature of the water further people rule that a klei shlishi must be used. Once again in the pouring process (erui klei sheini) more heat is emitted and therefore most people hold that the tea will not be cooked and it is therefore permissible to make tea with this water.[13]

Guardamar del Segura (Valencian pronunciation:[waama e seua]) or briefly Guardamar is a municipality of the province of Alicante located at the mouth of the river Segura in southern Valencia (autonomous community), Spain. It is a Mediterranean resort, with a large pine forest abutting an 11-km-long white sand beach. Historically an area of fishermen and farmers, Guardamar del Segura is the southernmost point where Valenciano (a dialect of Catalan) is spoken. A Phoenician colony, called Herna by Roman geographer Avienus in his book Ora Maritima was the first settlement near the mouth of Segura river,[1] In Spanish, "guardar" means "safekeeping" and "mar" means "sea", and this is another possible basis for its current name. Guardamar hosts local festivals like Moros i Cristians, L'Encant, and Fogueres de Sant Joan, which commemorate its history. Guardamar is the southernmost Catalan-speaking town, although as of 1991, 41.8% of the town's residents knew how to speak it.[2] The INE (Spanish Census) of 2006 showed that the city had 14,261 residents. By January 2011 this figure had reached 16,863 of which only 10,051 were Spanish. The most prominent nationalities in 2011 were: Carmen Verd is the mayor of the city.

To: Nathaniel
Content:
The Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union, usually known as CICCU, was the first university Christian Union and is the University of Cambridge's most prominent student Christian organisation. It was formed in 1877, but can trace its origins back to the formation of the Jesus Lane Sunday School in 1827 and the Cambridge Prayer Union in 1848. The organisation's stated purpose is "to make Jesus Christ known to students in Cambridge"[1]. Students in many other universities followed Cambridge's lead in forming their own Christian Unions, beginning with OICCU (Oxford) in 1879. Initially CICCU became part of the Student Christian Movement, formed in 1889; however, the two organisations clashed in 1910, and CICCU left the SCM in order to provide a specifically evangelical ministry in the University of Cambridge. Again, OICCU and other Unions followed them in this split, and together they founded the Inter Varsity Fellowship of Evangelical Unions (now UCCF, Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship) in 1928, which spread to Canada in the same year and later to the USA, Australia (Australian Fellowship of Evangelical Students) and New Zealand (Tertiary Students Christian Fellowship). Students who became members of the CICCU are asked to sign the following statement, "I desire in joining this Union to declare my faith in Jesus Christ as my Saviour, my Lord and my God". This was one of the issues in the dispute with the SCM. However, this declaration is not necessary to attend any events, become involved with helping or to attend any of the meetings held. CICCU is led by Christian students from a wide variety of backgrounds, united in a common desire to "make Jesus Christ known to students in Cambridge." Past CICCU members have included Josh Moody, Basil Atkinson, John F. Wenham, John Stott and Vaughan Roberts. The leadership operates on two levels - university wide and within colleges. A committee of eight students, known as the Exec organise CICCU. Two reps in each college lead college events and meetings. There are weekly meetings in almost every college during term time  these include bible study, prayer and praise. The college groups then meet together as a whole for Bible Teaching and prayer each week. The CICCU organises weekly talks, explaining what Christians believe, and discussion groups (Christianity Explored courses). The college groups organise termly events in the colleges where people can come and find out more about Christianity. Every year there is a high publicity main event during which events go on in most of the colleges and there are lunchtime and evening talks. CICCU adopts the doctrinal basis of UCCF, an evangelical Christian organisation with which CICCU is affiliated. The doctrinal basis contains what evangelicals perceive as the biblical foundations of Christianity, including: An organisation such as CICCU which embraces biblical truth as infallible will inevitably be controversial, and its tactics have been called into question as hardline and patronising [2]. Attitudes towards homosexuality have been a particular area of controversy, in particular during their 2004 Promise Week event, in which it was alleged that homosexual relations were equated with bestiality.[3]. CICCU members deny that their organisation is anti-gay, stressing "equality in the sight of God", and point out that they love homosexual and heterosexual friends equally, as does God.[citation needed].

ÿit. To bypass this problem we use a kos sheini. Using a Kos sheini is acceptable because when the liquid is poured (Erui kos sheini) some of the heat is transferred into the atmosphere, and therefore the liquid loses some heat. Most people hold that this will not cause enough heat to be emitted and therefore the tea leaves will still be cooked. To lower the temperature of the water further people rule that a klei shlishi must be used. Once again in the pouring process (erui klei sheini) more heat is emitted and therefore most people hold that the tea will not be cooked and it is therefore permissible to make tea with this water.[13]

He has been honored by the Prime Minister of India, New York State Governor, U.S. Congressmen, New York State senators, county executives, presiding supervisor of legislature, town boards, mayors and many prestigious associations and organizations in Indian and American community like SAAPC the largest Union, Federation of Indian Associations, Sri Chinmoi Mission at the United Nations, H.H.H.Pramukh Swamy Maharaj of B.A.P.S., News India Times Group Inc., Nargis Dutt Memorial Foundation Inc. Jackson Heights Merchants' Association, Shiromani Punjabi Puraskar by International Council of Punjab, Bharatiya Samaj Shiromani Award by the Akhil Vishwa Hindi Sammiti among others. Chopra has been profiled and honored by Americas oldest and prestigious biographer Marquis (since 1894) in WHOs WHO IN AMERICA; WHO'S WHO IN FINANCE AND INDUSTRY IN AMERICA; and WHOS WHO IN THE WORLD; for his achievements spanning over forty years.[6][7] He has five graduate degrees with honors including an MBA, and a Ph.D. in Business Administration from the Graduate Center at the City University of New York. He has taught at various Schools of Business Administration, over seven thousand BBA, MBA, and doctoral students, at quality oriented Universities, as a full time professor at: Hofstra, C.W.Post Campus of Long Island University, Rutgers, Kean and as an Adjunct Professor at Fordham University and Stevens Institute of Technology and has authored several books and articles in the field of Management in Business Administration. He joined the Academy of Management in 1976.[8] Chopra was Marshal of India Day Parade which he helped to organize in 1987-1988 as President of the Federation of Indian Associations for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. This parade is attended by over one hundred thousand people each year and is considered to be the largest parade outside India to celebrate India's independence movement and democratic rule.[citation needed] He served as General Secretary of National Federation of Indian American Associations (199294) and organized many regional and national functions to preserve and enhance Indian cultural heritage in America and promote the causes that strengthen the relationships between two strongest democracies of the world, India and USA. Since then he has frequently acted as a liaison with many elected officials in the region and the White House in Washington, D.C. In civil rights movement,Chopra has fought prejudice and racial discrimination against the Indian, Asian, and American community. In 1987-88 he spear headed the movement in Jersey City in the State of New Jersey and in New York City, New York by organizing community protests. He also participated directly in a debate at Columbia University, with the Chief of Police of New Jersey. He led the delegation to meet the Attorney General in Washington, D.C. and also organized seminars at the Crystal City Inn to fight discrimination where entire EEO Commission was in attendance. In 1989-90 he took an active role in organizing demonstrations in Jackson Heights, New York when Indian merchants and customers became targets of violence. With the assistance of Police Department, Mayor and the Borough Presidents Office the situations were resolved. Chopra founded Jackson Heights Merchants Association (1988), Flushing Merchants Association (1989) which are the business hubs of Indian community in New York City. He worked to improve the neighborhood conditions for merchants, customers and citizenry. Chopra is also the founder/President of Asian American Coalition USA Inc.

This has greatly helped not only Indian community to assimilate in America but also benefited countless[citation needed] causes in mainstream America. Chopra has also represented New York City Mayor and Comptroller and the two county executives on Long Island, New York at over three hundred functions over the past two decades welcoming such visitors as the Prime Minister of India, Federal Ministers, industrialists, ambassadors, consul generals, bishops, movie stars, and other people of significant achievements by presenting them with a key to the city, a flag of Nassau County, a citation or a proclamation to mark various events, achievements and celebrations.

Of the 2,132 who completed tertiary schooling, 31.4% were Swiss men, 26.9% were Swiss women, 22.2% were non-Swiss men and 19.5% were non-Swiss women.[7] During the 2009-2010 school year there were a total of 3,061 students in the Versoix school system. The education system in the Canton of Geneva allows young children to attend two years of non-obligatory Kindergarten.[20] During that school year, there were 200 children who were in a pre-kindergarten class. The canton's school system provides two years of non-mandatory kindergarten and requires students to attend six years of primary school, with some of the children attending smaller, specialized classes. In Versoix there were 413 students in kindergarten or primary school and 65 students were in the special, smaller classes. The secondary school program consists of three lower, obligatory years of schooling, followed by three to five years of optional, advanced schools. There were 413 lower secondary students who attended school in Versoix. There were 605 upper secondary students from the municipality along with 90 students who were in a professional, non-university track program. An additional 596 students attended a private school.[21] As of 2000[update], there were 1,082 students in Versoix who came from another municipality, while 688 residents attended schools outside the municipality.[19] Versoix is home to the Bibliothque Communale de Versoix library.[22] In Versoix there are four primary public schools:Ami-Argand, Bon Sjour, cole Lachenal and Monfleury. These schools go from Kindergarten to 6th grade. There is one public Middle school, the Collge des Colombires. This school goes from 7th to 9th grade. Students from Versoix, Genthod, Bellevue, Cligny, Chavannes-des-Bois and Crassier go to this school. There are no High Schools in Versoix, so the students have to go to Geneva. There is one private school Collge du Lman. The average annual temperature is 9C (48F) with an average annual rainfall of 930mm (36.6inches).

Subject: Anserimimus 
To: Anastasia
Content:
Deuterostomia Anserimimus (play/nsrmams/ AN-sr-i-MY-ms; "goose mimic") is a genus of ornithomimid theropod dinosaur, from the Late Cretaceous Period of what is now Mongolia. It was a lanky, fast-running animal, possibly an omnivore. From what fossils are known, it probably closely resembled other ornithomimids, except for its more powerful forelimbs. Anserimimus was found in the Mongolian aimag, or province, of Bayankhongor during a joint Soviet-Mongolian expedition to the Gobi Desert, in the late 1970s. Mongolian paleontologist Rinchen Barsbold named Anserimimus in 1988, combining the Latin anser meaning 'goose' with the Greek mimos meaning 'mimic'. Anser is the generic name of several species of geese. Although Anserimimus does not specifically resemble a goose, ornithomimosaurs have traditionally been named after different types of birds, such as Struthiomimus ('ostrich mimic'), Gallimimus ('rooster mimic'), and Pelecanimimus ('pelican mimic'). The one named species of Anserimimus is called Anserimimus planinychus. The specific name is derived from the Latin planus meaning 'flat', and the Ancient Greek , onyx, meaning 'claw', in reference to the peculiar flattened claws which characterize the genus.[1] Anserimimus was recovered from the Nemegt Formation of Mongolia. The Nemegt is thought to represent alluvial plains containing meandering rivers. The layer Anserimimus was found, is dating from the early Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous, or about 70 million years ago. There is only a single specimen of Anserimimus, its holotype IGM 100/300. It consists of a rather complete and articulated skeleton lacking the skull and lower jaws. Limited information has been published on the anatomy of Anserimimus, as Barsbold did not describe most of these bones, instead focusing on only those with features that set Anserimimus apart from other ornithomimids. In an unpublished thesis Robert Bronowicz in 2005 gave a detailed description of the species, also referring additional material to it, among which a second partial skeleton, specimen ZPAL MgD-I/65.[2] However, in 2010 Bronowicz concluded this other find, though most closely related to Anserimimus planinychus, probably represented a separate taxon.[3] Anserimimus was a medium-sized ornithomimosaurian. Gregory S. Paul in 2010 estimated its length at three metres, its weight at fifty kilogrammes.[4] The thighbone is 435 millimetres long. There are several key differences between it and related species, though most of these are shared with ZPAL MgD-I/65. The claws on the hand are long, low at the back and rather straight, only slightly curved, with the lower surface nearly flat. The forelimb is long and also built more powerfully than that of other ornithomimids, with large crests on the scapulocoracoid of the shoulder and humerus (upper arm bone), which provided attachment points for large arm muscles like the biceps. The metacarpus of the hand is fused, adding to the strength. The foot is strongly arctometatarsalian, with the third metatarsal excluded from the front surface of the metatarsus over 40% of its upper length. Anserimimus was by Barsbold assigned to the Ornithomimidae, a group of derived Ornithomimosauria. This has been confirmed by modern cladistic analysis. Its closest relative may be Gallimimus from the same formation albeit from a different area (Kobayashi & Lu, 2003; Kobayashi & Barsbold, 2005). Other studies have been unable specifically to determine its relationships or those of any other ornithomimids (Ji et al., 2003; Makovicky et al., 2004). Aside from Gallimimus, other theropods found in the Nemegt Formation include the gigantic Tarbosaurus and Deinocheirus, as well as smaller dromaeosaurids, oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, and birds. Herbivores are represented by the hadrosaurids Barsboldia and Saurolophus, the ankylosaurid Tarchia and several titanosaurian sauropods and pachycephalosaurians. The function of the powerful arm, with its straightened claws, remains unknown. It may indicate a different diet or food-gathering strategy than other ornithomimids, although its diet is difficult to determine, since the animal's skull is unknown. Scientists have long hypothesized that ornithomimids, descended from carnivorous theropod ancestors, were actually omnivores or even herbivores (Osborn, 1916).

The education system in the Canton of Geneva allows young children to attend two years of non-obligatory Kindergarten.[20] During that school year, there were 200 children who were in a pre-kindergarten class. The canton's school system provides two years of non-mandatory kindergarten and requires students to attend six years of primary school, with some of the children attending smaller, specialized classes. In Versoix there were 413 students in kindergarten or primary school and 65 students were in the special, smaller classes. The secondary school program consists of three lower, obligatory years of schooling, followed by three to five years of optional, advanced schools. There were 413 lower secondary students who attended school in Versoix. There were 605 upper secondary students from the municipality along with 90 students who were in a professional, non-university track program.

To: Tyler
Content:
Speechlessness of Sadness, is a volume of Turkish modern poetry by Seyhan Kurt. "Hznn Szyitimleri"(Speechlessness of Sadness) was publishing in 1998.It consists of three parts "Deterritorial,Agnostic and Incognitae". We are given the loneliness,alienation,individualism and rebellion created by modern world.The subject matter gives Kurt's poetry its peculiar quality. As the author casts these subjects into his lines,he uses a sharp and complex style.His stanzas variegate in length and his poetry disturbs and re-forms the routine language.The word combinations strikingly violate the order with outstanding,unexpected images. His free-verse often depends on the cadence or grouping of phrases, and the reading depends on either a slowing down or a speeding up till it reaches an emphasis in the final lines.There is a yearning for a better and meaningful life.He pictures man lost in a universe sometimes conscious of his own position. For Seyhan Kurt,man has made the worst of himself and therefore is helplessly lonely. For his art, we can conclude that "the surface of the world and mankind have lost their privacy." One feels driven into a world which he has no control of.

ÿs recovered from the Nemegt Formation of Mongolia. The Nemegt is thought to represent alluvial plains containing meandering rivers. The layer Anserimimus was found, is dating from the early Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous, or about 70 million years ago. There is only a single specimen of Anserimimus, its holotype IGM 100/300. It consists of a rather complete and articulated skeleton lacking the skull and lower jaws. Limited information has been published on the anatomy of Anserimimus, as Barsbold did not describe most of these bones, instead focusing on only those with features that set Anserimimus apart from other ornithomimids. In an unpublished thesis Robert Bronowicz in 2005 gave a detailed description of the species, also referring additional material to it, among which a second partial skeleton, specimen ZPAL MgD-I/65.[2] However, in 2010 Bronowicz concluded this other find, though most closely related to Anserimimus planinychus, probably represented a separate taxon.[3] Anserimimus was a medium-sized ornithomimosaurian. Gregory S. Paul in 2010 estimated its length at three metres, its weight at fifty kilogrammes.[4] The thighbone is 435 millimetres long. There are several key differences between it and related species, though most of these are shared with ZPAL MgD-I/65. The claws on the hand are long, low at the back and rather straight, only slightly curved, with the lower surface nearly flat. The forelimb is long and also built more powerfully than that of other ornithomimids, with large crests on the scapulocoracoid of the shoulder and humerus (upper arm bone), which provided attachment points for large arm muscles like the biceps. The metacarpus of the hand is fused, adding to the strength. The foot is strongly arctometatarsalian, with the third metatarsal excluded from the front surface of the metatarsus over 40% of its upper length. Anserimimus was by Barsbold assigned to the Ornithomimidae, a group of derived Ornithomimosauria. This has been confirmed by modern cladistic analysis. Its closest relative may be Gallimimus from the same formation albeit from a different area (Kobayashi & Lu, 2003; Kobayashi & Barsbold, 2005). Other studies have been unable specifically to determine its relationships or those of any other ornithomimids (Ji et al., 2003; Makovicky et al., 2004). Aside from Gallimimus, other theropods found in the Nemegt Formation include the gigantic Tarbosaurus and Deinocheirus, as well as smaller dromaeosaurids, oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, and birds. Herbivores are represented by the hadrosaurids Barsboldia and Saurolophus, the ankylosaurid Tarchia and several titanosaurian sauropods and pachycephalosaurians. The function of the powerful arm, with its straightened claws, remains unknown. It may indicate a different diet or food-gathering strategy than other ornithomimids, although its diet is difficult to determine, since the animal's skull is unknown. Scientists have long hypothesized that ornithomimids, descended from carnivorous theropod ancestors, were actually omnivores or even herbivores (Osborn, 1916).

James Kelley Washington (born August 21, 1979 in Stephens City, Virginia[1]) is an American football wide receiver for the San Diego Chargers. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the third round of the 2003 NFL Draft. He played college football at Tennessee. Washington has also been a member of the New England Patriots, Baltimore Ravens and Philadelphia Eagles. Washington attended Sherando High School in Stephens City, Virginia and was a letterman in football, basketball, and baseball. In football, he was a two-way starter as a quarterback and defensive back and as a senior he was an All-State selection. He twice led his team to the Virginia Class AA-Division 4 State Championship game, though the Warriors lost both times. He was taken in the 10th round of the June 1997 baseball draft by the Florida Marlins and signed as a shortstop. Washington spent four years in the minors, often rooming with current star pitcher Josh Beckett. Washington spent two seasons at the University of Tennessee. As a 22-year-old freshman in 2001, he caught 70 passes for 1080 yards and seven touchdowns and made the freshman All-American team. Considered a lock to be a first-round pick if he left early, Washington stayed for his sophomore year but was limited to four games due to injuries. After missing the first two games of that 2002 season with a knee sprain, and suffered a concussion Oct. 12 at Georgia that sidelined him for the remainder of the season. He underwent surgery on Nov. 19 to fuse two vertebrae in his neck. He finished his two-year career with 93 catches for 1523 yards and eight touchdowns. He was an Arts and sciences major. He was drafted by Cincinnati in the 3rd round of the 2003 draft. He never got much playing time while in Cincinnati, recording just 893 yards and 9 touchdowns in 4 seasons. In Cincinnati, he was famous for his signature "Squirrel" dance after scoring touchdowns. He was released following the 2006 season. On March 11, 2007, Washington agreed to a five year deal with the New England Patriots, reuniting him with his college teammate and fellow wide receiver Dont Stallworth. The deal, with a $300,000 signing bonus and a $4-million bonus due in the 2008, could be worth as much as $22 million over five years.[2] While Washington had not been used as a wide receiver by the Patriots, he had seen time on special teams, blocking a punt against the New York Jets. On February 29, 2008, Washington was re-signed by the Patriots under a new contract.[3] Washington was released by the Patriots on February 17, 2009. He visited the New York Jets on February 18, and the Buffalo Bills on February 24, continuing the cycle of players between AFC East teams.

Aside from Gallimimus, other theropods found in the Nemegt Formation include the gigantic Tarbosaurus and Deinocheirus, as well as smaller dromaeosaurids, oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, and birds. Herbivores are represented by the hadrosaurids Barsboldia and Saurolophus, the ankylosaurid Tarchia and several titanosaurian sauropods and pachycephalosaurians. The function of the powerful arm, with its straightened claws, remains unknown. It may indicate a different diet or food-gathering strategy than other ornithomimids, although its diet is difficult to determine, since the animal's skull is unknown. Scientists have long hypothesized that ornithomimids, descended from carnivorous theropod ancestors, were actually omnivores or even herbivores (Osborn, 1916).

Subject: Sierra de Cuera 
To: Dennis
Content:
Sierra de Cuera (Asturian: Sierra del Cuera), is a 30 km long mountain chain of the Cantabrian Mountains. The ridge's highest point is Pico Turbina (1315 m). This mountain range is located at 6 km from the sea and runs parallel to the coast. It lies within the Cabrales, Llanes, Peamellera Alta, Peamellera Baja and Ribadedeva municipal terms. The mountains of the Sierra de Cuera were vital to the defence of Asturias during the Spanish Civil War (1936 - 1939) and the key to the Sierra de Cuera was the pass of El Mazuco. Following the fall of Bilbao the troops supporting General Franco's rebellion tried to advance by clearing the Republican defenders from these mountains. In order to do this they planned a pincer movement moving south-west from Llanes and west, along the Ro Cares, from Panes towards Cabrales. On both fronts, however, the rugged terrain and the stiff resistance of the Republican loyalists halted the advance during what became known as the Battle of El Mazuco.[1] These mountains were once one of the last refuges of the Iberian Wolf, unfortunately the last one was killed in 2008.[2]

The function of the powerful arm, with its straightened claws, remains unknown. It may indicate a different diet or food-gathering strategy than other ornithomimids, although its diet is difficult to determine, since the animal's skull is unknown. Scientists have long hypothesized that ornithomimids, descended from carnivorous theropod ancestors, were actually omnivores or even herbivores (Osborn, 1916).

The 2008 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Tournament was held from May 10 through May 26, 2008. This was the 38th annual Division I NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament. Sixteen NCAA Division I college men's lacrosse teams met after having played their way through a regular season, and for some, a conference tournament. The first round of the single-elimination tournament was played on May 10 and May 11 at the home field of the top-seeded team. The quarterfinals were held on May 17 and May 18 on two separate neutral fields: the Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland, and Schoellkopf Field in Ithaca, New York. The tournament culminated with the semifinals and finals held on Memorial Day weekend at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. The championship weekend, which included the Division II and Division III championships, was hosted by Harvard University and the Eastern College Athletic Conference.[1][2] The championship was won by Syracuse University, beating Johns Hopkins University 1310, in front of a title game record crowd of 48,970 fans.[3] The Division I NCAA Mens Lacrosse Committee was responsible for selecting the teams that competed in the championship tournament. The qualifying teams, along with the seeding for each team in the tournament, were announced on Sunday, May 4, 2008. Seven conferences received automatic bids to the tournament for its top team. The remaining nine teams were selected as "at large" bids by the committee.[4] Five conferences held a conference tournament championship to award the conferences' bid. Canisius earned an automatic bid by winning the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) championship. This marks the first time that Canisius College has gained entry to the National Championship tournament.[5] Colgate earned an automatic bid by winning its first-ever Patriot League championship.[6] Hofstra earned an automatic bid by winning Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) championship,[7] Notre Dame earned an automatic bid by winning Great Western Lacrosse League (GWLL) championship,[8] and UMBC earned an automatic bid by winning America East Conference championship.[9] Two conferences award their bids based on regular season conference records. Loyola earned an automatic bid by winning the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) championship with a 61 conference record.[10] The Ivy League's automatic bid was awarded to Cornell. Cornell and Brown had identical conference records, but due to a victory by Cornell in head to head competition earlier in the season the tiebreaker was given to Cornell.[11] The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) conference tournament champion was Duke.[12] However, the ACC does not receive an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament because a conference must have at least six members competing (for 2 years) in order to be awarded an automatic bid.[13] The following teams were awarded at-large bids by the NCAA Selection Committee: Duke (ACC), Virginia (ACC), Syracuse (Independent), North Carolina (ACC), Johns Hopkins (Independent), Maryland (ACC), Denver (GWLL), Navy (Patriot), and Ohio State (GWLL).[4] The first round of the 2008 championship tournament saw upsets, an overtime game, and the NCAA career points record broken. Unseeded Ohio State bested #8 Cornell 157. The opening goal of this game was scored by Ohio State goaltender Stefan Schroder, who ran the length of the field to put one past the Big Red netminder.[15] Navy upset #4 seeded North Carolina in Chapel Hill with a final score of 87 on the strong play of the Midshipmen defense and the four goal effort of Tim Paul, who was honored with Nike Player of the Week honors.[16] Notre Dame, who was hosting its first NCAA Tournament game, topped Colgate in a contest that was settled in overtime.[17] In a victory over Loyola, Duke's Matt Danowski broke the NCAA career points record, eclipsing Joe Vasta's mark.[18] Syracuse ended Canisius's first ever appearance in the tournament early with a 2019 battle.[19] Johns Hopkins was led by Paul Rabil's four goals in a 104 win over Hofstra.[20] Virginia's Garrett Billings third goal of the game with 6:50 left in the game sealed the Cavaliers win over UMBC.[21] Maryland beat GWLL's Denver 107.[22] The quarterfinals were held at two separate locations the weekend of May 17 and May 18. On Saturday, 17,017 people attended the quarterfinals at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. This set an attendance record for most number of people to attend the quarterfinal round of the lacrosse championships.[23] Fans in attendance saw Johns Hopkins defeat Navy 104. Navy was held without a goal for both the second and third quarters.[24] The other game played in Annapolis was Maryland versus Virginia, which went into overtime. Ben Rubeor scored the game winning goal in the extra period to send the Cavaliers to the semifinals.[25] On Sunday, at Cornell's Schoellkopf Field, Syracuse defeated Notre Dame 119 on the play of midfielder Dan Hardy who recorded four points, including three goals and the game winning score.[26] Also, Duke routed Ohio State 2110 on the offensive efforts of Zack Greer who recorded a career-high eleven points on six goals and five assists.[27] On Saturday, May 24, 48,224 fans were spectators for the 2008 Division I Final Four doubleheader held at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.[28] The first game featured Syracuse versus Virginia, and the second was a rematch of last year's championship game between Johns Hopkins and Duke. In the first game of the Final Four doubleheader, Syracuse defeated Virginia 1211 in a double overtime thriller.[29] Virginia commanded the first half of the contest due in part to extra-man opportunities resulting from penalties by Syracuse. In the second quarter, the Cavaliers went on a run of five unanswered goals and entered half-time with a 63 lead, and the game's momentum. The game remained in Virginia's favor through the third quarter, prior to the Orange fourth quarter comeback.[29] Syracuse's Mike Leveille scored five goals, including a goal with 3:00 remaining in the game to send the game into overtime, and the eventual game-winner in the second overtime period to propel the Orange into the Championship game. Syracuse's come-from-behind victory included scoring six of the final eight goals of the contest.[29] Syracuse's Junior midfielder Matt Abbott, known more for his groundball and clearing game, tallied three goals in the second half for his first career hat trick to spark to second half rally. Extra possessions earned by face-off specialist Danny Brennan, including both opportunities in the overtime periods and 70% total for the game, helped the Orange stage the comeback. While, Syracuse goalkeeper John Galloway settled down in the second half and made a number game saving stops as regulation time expired.[29] Virginia scoring was led by Danny Glading with three goals and one assist, while Garret Billings scored two goals. Ben Rubeor, a Tewaaraton Trophy finalist, was held to one point on an assist.[29] Johns Hopkins defeated Duke 109 in the second game of the Final Four doubleheader. The heavily-favored Duke team, who had beaten the Blue Jays earlier in the season 176, were handed only their second loss of the season.[30] Hopkins controlled the deliberate tempo of the game, and held a 42 lead going into halftime. After scoring first after halftime, Hopkins saw Duke pull even with three goals in 45seconds during the third quarter, including back-to-back goals just 7seconds apart.[30] In fourth quarter, the speed of the game accelerated as Duke began to push offensively. Johns Hopkins goaltender Michael Gvozden was up to the task. He recorded 7 of his 17 saves in the fourth quarter, including one as time expired to seal the victory.[30] Hopkins was led by Senior Kevin Huntley who netted four goals in the contest.[30] On Memorial Day, Monday May 26, Syracuse defeated Johns Hopkins in the national championship game 1310 in front of 48,970 fans at Gillette Stadium. This game set the attendance record for the NCAA lacrosse championship game and for any NCAA outdoor championship.[28] This marks the 10th victory in a national championship game for the Syracuse program.[31][32] This is John Desko's, Syracuse's Head coach, fourth championship in his ten-year career at Syracuse.[3] The Orange were led by midfielder Dan Hardy with a team-high three goals, fifth-year Senior face-off specialist Danny Brennan who scored his first career goal, and attackman Mike Leveille, the tournament's Most Outstanding Player honoree and 2008 Tewaaraton Trophy winner, who recorded three points on one goal and two assists.[33] Syracuse goalkeeper John Galloway became the first true freshman goaltender in NCAA history to record 16 wins in one season,[29] and just the fourth to win an NCAA title.[3] Johns Hopkins' Paul Rabil played an outstanding game leading his team with career-high six goals and one assist in the losing effort.[34] In addition, Blue Jay netminder Michael Gvozden made 20 saves, the most saves in a Championship game since Maryland's Brian Dougherty in 1995.[35]

Content:
Ambilikile Mwasapile is a Tanzanian medicine man who uses a tree known as mugariga to make a juice which he claims can cure any disease. The main illnesses that Mwasapile claims to cure are AIDS, diabetes, stroke, high and low blood pressure. The medicine's efficacy has not been clinically assessed. Mwasapile is a retired Lutheran pastor who lives in Samunge village in Loliondo, near Ngorongoro. Mwasapile had a vision in which God instructed him to make his medicine. His vision was of a tree that provided medicine and that many people would come to be healed. After waking up, he said he met a woman who had AIDS and she told him that she came for medicine. Mwasapile followed his vision and allegedly healed her affliction. The woman told her former boss who had fired her due to sickness. The boss had a sick child suffering from brain damage. Mwasapile allegedly healed the child. As word spread, an average of 4,000 pilgrims perday visited him as of early 2011.[1] The government of Tanzania ordered Mwasapile to stop, but due to public demand the government revised the order and provided Mwasapile with support for sanitation. However, his medicine cannot legally be given by other doctors. Notables who have visited Mwasapile include ministers and members of parliament from Tanzania and Kenya and businessmen. The wife of DRC president Joseph Kabila visited Mwasapile. Due to poor infrastructure, road transport costs roughly 500 times the price of the medicine, which is 500 Tanzania shillings.

The genus Pelecinus is the only living member of the family Pelecinidae (there are also two fossil genera), and contains only three species restricted to the New World. One species, Pelecinus polyturator, occurs from North through South America, and the others occur in Mexico (Pelecinus thoracicus) and South America (Pelecinus dichrous). The females are glossy wasps, very long (up to 7cm) and the abdomen is extremely attenuated, used to lay eggs directly on scarab larvae buried in the soil. Pelecinus polyturator is a shiny black wasp-like insect, about two inches long. Its abdomen is uniquely long and slender. It parasitizes June beetle larvae (white grubs). P. polyturator is parthenogenic; females do not require fertilization to reproduce. Females are common throughout its range; males are rare in the U.S. and Canada, but more common further south.

This marks the first time that Canisius College has gained entry to the National Championship tournament.[5] Colgate earned an automatic bid by winning its first-ever Patriot League championship.[6] Hofstra earned an automatic bid by winning Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) championship,[7] Notre Dame earned an automatic bid by winning Great Western Lacrosse League (GWLL) championship,[8] and UMBC earned an automatic bid by winning America East Conference championship.[9] Two conferences award their bids based on regular season conference records. Loyola earned an automatic bid by winning the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) championship with a 61 conference record.[10] The Ivy League's automatic bid was awarded to Cornell. Cornell and Brown had identical conference records, but due to a victory by Cornell in head to head competition earlier in the season the tiebreaker was given to Cornell.[11] The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) conference tournament champion was Duke.[12] However, the ACC does not receive an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament because a conference must have at least six members competing (for 2 years) in order to be awarded an automatic bid.[13] The following teams were awarded at-large bids by the NCAA Selection Committee: Duke (ACC), Virginia (ACC), Syracuse (Independent), North Carolina (ACC), Johns Hopkins (Independent), Maryland (ACC), Denver (GWLL), Navy (Patriot), and Ohio State (GWLL).[4] The first round of the 2008 championship tournament saw upsets, an overtime game, and the NCAA career points record broken. Unseeded Ohio State bested #8 Cornell 157. The opening goal of this game was scored by Ohio State goaltender Stefan Schroder, who ran the length of the field to put one past the Big Red netminder.[15] Navy upset #4 seeded North Carolina in Chapel Hill with a final score of 87 on the strong play of the Midshipmen defense and the four goal effort of Tim Paul, who was honored with Nike Player of the Week honors.[16] Notre Dame, who was hosting its first NCAA Tournament game, topped Colgate in a contest that was settled in overtime.[17] In a victory over Loyola, Duke's Matt Danowski broke the NCAA career points record, eclipsing Joe Vasta's mark.[18] Syracuse ended Canisius's first ever appearance in the tournament early with a 2019 battle.[19] Johns Hopkins was led by Paul Rabil's four goals in a 104 win over Hofstra.[20] Virginia's Garrett Billings third goal of the game with 6:50 left in the game sealed the Cavaliers win over UMBC.[21] Maryland beat GWLL's Denver 107.[22] The quarterfinals were held at two separate locations the weekend of May 17 and May 18. On Saturday, 17,017 people attended the quarterfinals at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. This set an attendance record for most number of people to attend the quarterfinal round of the lacrosse championships.[23] Fans in attendance saw Johns Hopkins defeat Navy 104. Navy was held without a goal for both the second and third quarters.[24] The other game played in Annapolis was Maryland versus Virginia, which went into overtime. Ben Rubeor scored the game winning goal in the extra period to send the Cavaliers to the semifinals.[25] On Sunday, at Cornell's Schoellkopf Field, Syracuse defeated Notre Dame 119 on the play of midfielder Dan Hardy who recorded four points, including three goals and the game winning score.[26] Also, Duke routed Ohio State 2110 on the offensive efforts of Zack Greer who recorded a career-high eleven points on six goals and five assists.[27] On Saturday, May 24, 48,224 fans were spectators for the 2008 Division I Final Four doubleheader held at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.[28] The first game featured Syracuse versus Virginia, and the second was a rematch of last year's championship game between Johns Hopkins and Duke. In the first game of the Final Four doubleheader, Syracuse defeated Virginia 1211 in a double overtime thriller.[29] Virginia commanded the first half of the contest due in part to extra-man opportunities resulting from penalties by Syracuse. In the second quarter, the Cavaliers went on a run of five unanswered goals and entered half-time with a 63 lead, and the game's momentum. The game remained in Virginia's favor through the third quarter, prior to the Orange fourth quarter comeback.[29] Syracuse's Mike Leveille scored five goals, including a goal with 3:00 remaining in the game to send the game into overtime, and the eventual game-winner in the second overtime period to propel the Orange into the Championship game. Syracuse's come-from-behind victory included scoring six of the final eight goals of the contest.[29] Syracuse's Junior midfielder Matt Abbott, known more for his groundball and clearing game, tallied three goals in the second half for his first career hat trick to spark to second half rally. Extra possessions earned by face-off specialist Danny Brennan, including both opportunities in the overtime periods and 70% total for the game, helped the Orange stage the comeback. While, Syracuse goalkeeper John Galloway settled down in the second half and made a number game saving stops as regulation time expired.[29] Virginia scoring was led by Danny Glading with three goals and one assist, while Garret Billings scored two goals. Ben Rubeor, a Tewaaraton Trophy finalist, was held to one point on an assist.[29] Johns Hopkins defeated Duke 109 in the second game of the Final Four doubleheader. The heavily-favored Duke team, who had beaten the Blue Jays earlier in the season 176, were handed only their second loss of the season.[30] Hopkins controlled the deliberate tempo of the game, and held a 42 lead going into halftime. After scoring first after halftime, Hopkins saw Duke pull even with three goals in 45seconds during the third quarter, including back-to-back goals just 7seconds apart.[30] In fourth quarter, the speed of the game accelerated as Duke began to push offensively. Johns Hopkins goaltender Michael Gvozden was up to the task. He recorded 7 of his 17 saves in the fourth quarter, including one as time expired to seal the victory.[30] Hopkins was led by Senior Kevin Huntley who netted four goals in the contest.[30] On Memorial Day, Monday May 26, Syracuse defeated Johns Hopkins in the national championship game 1310 in front of 48,970 fans at Gillette Stadium.

The education system in the Canton of Geneva allows young children to attend two years of non-obligatory Kindergarten.[20] During that school year, there were 200 children who were in a pre-kindergarten class. The canton's school system provides two years of non-mandatory kindergarten and requires students to attend six years of primary school, with some of the children attending smaller, specialized classes. In Versoix there were 413 students in kindergarten or primary school and 65 students were in the special, smaller classes. The secondary school program consists of three lower, obligatory years of schooling, followed by three to five years of optional, advanced schools. There were 413 lower secondary students who attended school in Versoix. There were 605 upper secondary students from the municipality along with 90 students who were in a professional, non-university track program.

John Ryan "J.R." Fitzpatrick (born May 9, 1988 in Cambridge, Ontario) is a Canadian stock car driver. He is currently the youngest driver to win the CASCAR Super Series championship. He drives the No. 84 Chevrolet for Fitzpatrick Motorsports in the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series and the No. 60 Chevrolet for Turn One Racing in the Camping World Truck Series. John Ryan (J.R.) Fitzpatrick got his first taste of racing in karts at the age of six, moving quickly to the Canadian Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (CASCAR) junior ranks and then on to Late Model stock cars by the time he was 13 years old. Racing in the Cascar Super Series what is now the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series at age 16, Fitzpatrick finished 11th in the point standings and second in the Rookie of the Year standings in 2004. Then at 17, he achieved three top-five and five top-10 finishes, scoring his first win. At age 18, he became the youngest driver to become a Canadian Tire Series National Champion with one win, five podium finishes and two pole awards. He remained in his fathers #84 Chevrolet after CASCAR was acquired by NASCAR; In 2007, Fitzpatrick earned two wins, four top-fives, seven top-10s and three pole awards in the Canadian Tire Series where sponsorship came from Milwaukee Tools. In 2008 he had one victory (Mosport), five top-fives, six top-10s and two pole awards. While 2009, he drove the #84 for a part time deal winning Circuit Gilles Villeneuve leading the most laps. For 2010 he returned to the series full time with sponsorship from Shick he picked up his first win of the season at Mosport on the road course layout on June 13 and also won the event at Edmonton, he swapped the points lead with D.J. Kennington for over five times during the year going on to finishes second in the points. He ran again in the series in 2011, finishing third in points; he will return to the series in the No. 84 in 2012.[1] In early 2012 it was announced that Fitzpatrick would compete in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race in August 2012 at Watkins Glen International for Turn One Racing.[1] Fitzpatrick made his mainstream NASCAR debut in the NASCAR Busch Series (now the NASCAR Nationwide Series) race at the Telcel-Motorola Mexico 200 at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in Mexico City, Mexico. He came in 33rd place in that race[2] due to an ill handling racecar. He finished 43rd in the NASCAR Busch Series race at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Quebec on August 4, 2007,[3] right after the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series race at the same track where he won the race. He drove the famed #4 KHI Chevy at both of the road courses in 2009. He Finishing 19th at Watkins Glen after getting in a wreck on the last lap. In Montreal he was on pace for a top 10 finish before staling the car after going off course leading to a poor finish one lap down. It was announced that J.R. will drive for Dale Earnhardt Jr. in all three road course in his #7 team for 2010, he picked up his first Nationwide top 10 coming home 7th at Road America (Nationwide)on June 19 and his second top 10 with a 7th in Montreal. Fitzpatrick returned to the Nationwide Series with Baker Curb Racing at Daytona International Speedway sponsored by Schick. However, he finished 42nd in the race. He competed in six further races during the year for Go Canada Racing. On Feb. 13, 2009, Fitzpatrick finished fourth in his No. 7 Mammoet Chevrolet Silverado at Daytona International Speedway during the NextEra Energy Resources 250 Camping World Truck Series Event. Fitzpatrick led 17 laps in the event, his third race in the series and first at a restrictor plate track.[4] After Martinsville his deal with Kevin Buckler at TRG Motorsports fell through and he was a free agent. After driving several races for Kevin Harvick, Inc. and Chase Mattioli in 2009 and 2011, he moved full-time to the Camping World Truck Series in 2012, driving the No. 60 Chevrolet for Turn One Racing.[1] 2010 Nationwide car at Road America 2011 Nationwide car at Road America

Subject: Balance (game design) 
To: Chelsea
Content:
In game design, balance is the concept and the practice of tuning a game's rules, usually with the goal of preventing any of its component systems from being ineffective or otherwise undesirable when compared to their peers. An unbalanced system represents wasted development resources at the very least, and at worst can undermine the game's entire ruleset by making important roles or tasks impossible to perform.[1] Balancing does not necessarily mean making a game fair. This is particularly true of action games: Jaime Griesemer, design lead at Bungie, said in a lecture to other designers that "every fight in Halo is unfair".[2] This potential for unfairness creates uncertainty, leading to the tension and excitement that action games seek to deliver.[3][4][1] In these cases balancing is instead the management of unfair scenarios, with the ultimate goal of ensuring that all of the strategies which the game intends to support are viable.[2] The extent to which those strategies are equal to one another defines the character of the game in question. Simulation games can be balanced unfairly in order to be true to life. A wargame may cast the player into the role of a general who was defeated by an overwhelming force, and it is common for the abilities of teams in sports games to mirror those of the real-world teams they represent regardless of the implications for players who pick them. Digital games often allow players to influence their balance by offering a choice of "difficulty levels".[5] These affect how challenging the game is to play. In addition to altering the game's rules, difficulty levels can be used to alter what content is presented to the player. This usually takes the form of adding or removing challenging location or events, but some games also change their narrative to reward players who play them on higher difficulty levels (Max Payne 2) or end early as punishment for playing on easy (Castlevania). Difficulty selection is not always presented bluntly, particularly in competitive games where all players are affected equally and the standard "easy/hard" terminology no longer applies. Sometimes veiled language is used (Mario Kart offers "CC select"), while at other times there may be an array of granular settings instead of an overarching difficulty option. An alternative approach to difficulty levels is catering to players of all abilities at the same time, a technique that has been called "subjective difficulty".[6] This requires a game to provide multiple solutions or routes, each offering challenges appropriate to players of different skill levels (Super Mario Galaxy, Sonic Generations). Difficulty can also be managed by a third party or the game itself; see the Gamemaster section below. Balancing goals shift dramatically when players are contending with the game's environment and/or non-player characters. Such player versus environment games are usually balanced to tread the fine line of regularly challenging players' abilities without ever producing insurmountable or unfair obstacles.[4] This turns balancing into the management of dramatic structure,[3] generally referred to by game designers as "pacing". Pacing is also a consideration in competitive games, but the autonomy of players makes it harder to control. The simplest game balancing technique is giving each player identical resources. Most competitive games feature some level of symmetry; some (such as Pong) are completely symmetric, but those in which players alternate turns (such as Chess) can never achieve total symmetry as one player will always have a first-move advantage. Symmetry can be undone by human psychology. The advantage of players wearing red over players wearing blue is a well-documented example of this.[7][8] The brute force approach to balancing is the mathematical analysis of game session results. With enough data, it is possible to identify unbalanced areas of a game and make corrections. Randomisation of starting conditions is a technique common in board games, card games, and also experimental research[9] which fights back against the human tendency to optimise patterns in one's favour.[2] The downside of randomisation is that it takes control away from the player, potentially leading to frustration. Methods of overcoming this include giving the player a selection of random results within which they can optimise (Scrabble, Magic: The Gathering) and making each game session short enough to encourage multiple attempts in one play session (Klondike (solitaire), Strange Adventures in Infinite Space). Many games become more challenging if the player is successful. For instance, real-time strategy games often feature "upkeep", a resource tax that scales with the number of units under a player's control.[10] Team games which challenge players to invade their opponents' territory (football, capture the flag) have a feedback loop by default: the further a player pushes, the more opponents they are likely to face. Feedback loops can lead to frequent ties if enforced too strictly. See also Dynamic game difficulty balancing. A game can be balanced dynamically by a gamemaster who observes players and adjusts the game in response to their emotional state (Dungeons & Dragons, Left 4 Dead). Although gamemasters have historically been humans, some videogames now feature AI systems that perform a similar role by monitoring player ability and inferring emotional state from input.[4] Research into biofeedback peripherals is set to greatly improve the accuracy of such systems.[11] In role-playing game slang, a "gimp" is a character, character class or character ability that is underpowered in the context of the game. Gimped characters lack effectiveness compared to other characters at a similar level of experience.[12] A player may gimp a character by assigning skills and abilities that are inappropriate for the character class, or by developing the character inefficiently.[13] However, this is not always the case, as some characters are purposely "gimped" by the game's developers in order to provide an incentive for raising their level, or, conversely, to give the player an early head-start. An example of this is Final Fantasy's Mystic Knight class, which starts out weak, but is able to become the most powerful class if brought to a very high level. Gimps may also be accidental on the part of the developer, and may require a software patch to rebalance. Sometimes, especially in MMORPGs, gimp is used as a synonym for nerf to describe a rule modification that weakens the affected target. Unlike the connotatively neutral term nerf[citation needed], gimp in this usage often implies that the rule change unfairly disadvantages the target.[14] A "nerf" is a change to a game that reduces the desirability or effectiveness of a particular game element. The term is also used as a verb for the act of making such a change.[15] The first established use of the term was in Ultima Online, as a reference to the NERF brand of toys which are soft and less likely to cause serious injury.[16][17] Among game developers, MMORPG designers are especially likely to nerf aspects of a game in order to maintain game balance. Occasionally a new feature (such as an item, class, or skill) may be made too powerful, too cheap, or too easily obtained to the extent that it unbalances the game system. This is sometimes due to an unforeseen bug or method of using or acquiring the object that was not considered by the developers.[16][18] The frequency of nerfing and the scale of nerfing vary widely from game to game but almost all massively multiplayer games have engaged in nerfing at some point.[18] Nerfs in various online games, including Anarchy Online, have spurred in-world protests.[17] Since many items in virtual worlds are sold or traded among players, a nerf may have an outsized impact on the virtual economy. As players respond, the nerf may cause prices to fluctuate before settling down in a different equilibrium. This impact on the economy, along with the original impact of the nerf, can cause large player resentment for even a small change.[17][18] In particular, in the case of items or abilities which have been nerfed, players can become upset over the perceived wasted efforts in obtaining the now nerfed features.[17][18] A well-known instance in which a nerf has caused many protests, but much more praise, is when Infinity Ward nerfed the Model 1887s in its video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Before the nerf, the Model 1887s were able to One Shot Kill from medium-long range when all other shotguns in game were limited to short-medium range. The nerfing of the Model 1887s reduced its range to short range. For games where avatars and items represent significant economic value, this may bring up legal issues over the lost value.[19] Overpowered (often abbreviated to OP) is a common term referring to a perceived lack of game balance. It is often used when describing a specific class in an RPG, a specific faction in strategic games, or a specific tactic, ability, weapon or unit in various games. For something to be deemed overpowered, it is either the best choice in a disproportionate number of situations (marginalising other choices) and/or excessively hard to counter by the opponent compared to the effort required to use it.

Konrad Bleuler (23 September 1912, Herzogenbuchsee  1 January 1992, Knigswinter) was a Swiss physicist who worked in the field of theoretical particle physics and quantum field theory.[1] He is known for his work on the quantisation of the photon, the GuptaBleuler formalism.[2] Bleuler was born in Herzogenbuchsee, Switzerland on 23 September 1912. He received his doctorate for the mathematical work titled "On the Rolle's theorem for the operator u + u and related properties of the Green's function" from the ETH Zurich in 1942. His thesis advisor was Michel Plancherel. From 1960 to 1980 he was a Professor at the University of Bonn, where he founded the Institute of Theoretical Nuclear Physics, which is now the Helmholtz Institute for Radiation and Nuclear Physics. Even after his retirement, he was active and remained there until his death. 1971 Bleuler organized the first "International Conference on Differential Geometric Methods in Theoretical Physics" and since then he had been organizing the conference regularly. The last one was the 19th Conference in 1990 held at Rapallo. In 1993, at the 22nd Conference in his honor a "Bleuler Medal" awarded.[2] Bleuler's most notable contribution was the introduction of GuptaBleuler formalism for the quantization of the electromagnetic field, which he developed independently with Suraj N. Gupta.[3] This was an important work on quantum electrodynamics. Bleuler also made contributions to nuclear and particle physics. He also wrote about the work of other famous scientists, so on Wolfgang Pauli[4] and Rolf Nevanlinna.

ÿvels can be used to alter what content is presented to the player. This usually takes the form of adding or removing challenging location or events, but some games also change their narrative to reward players who play them on higher difficulty levels (Max Payne 2) or end early as punishment for playing on easy (Castlevania). Difficulty selection is not always presented bluntly, particularly in competitive games where all players are affected equally and the standard "easy/hard" terminology no longer applies. Sometimes veiled language is used (Mario Kart offers "CC select"), while at other times there may be an array of granular settings instead of an overarching difficulty option. An alternative approach to difficulty levels is catering to players of all abilities at the same time, a technique that has been called "subjective difficulty".[6] This requires a game to provide multiple solutions or routes, each offering challenges appropriate to players of different skill levels (Super Mario Galaxy, Sonic Generations). Difficulty can also be managed by a third party or the game itself; see the Gamemaster section below. Balancing goals shift dramatically when players are contending with the game's environment and/or non-player characters. Such player versus environment games are usually balanced to tread the fine line of regularly challenging players' abilities without ever producing insurmountable or unfair obstacles.[4] This turns balancing into the management of dramatic structure,[3] generally referred to by game designers as "pacing". Pacing is also a consideration in competitive games, but the autonomy of players makes it harder to control. The simplest game balancing technique is giving each player identical resources. Most competitive games feature some level of symmetry; some (such as Pong) are completely symmetric, but those in which players alternate turns (such as Chess) can never achieve total symmetry as one player will always have a first-move advantage. Symmetry can be undone by human psychology. The advantage of players wearing red over players wearing blue is a well-documented example of this.[7][8] The brute force approach to balancing is the mathematical analysis of game session results. With enough data, it is possible to identify unbalanced areas of a game and make corrections. Randomisation of starting conditions is a technique common in board games, card games, and also experimental research[9] which fights back against the human tendency to optimise patterns in one's favour.[2] The downside of randomisation is that it takes control away from the player, potentially leading to frustration. Methods of overcoming this include giving the player a selection of random results within which they can optimise (Scrabble, Magic: The Gathering) and making each game session short enough to encourage multiple attempts in one play session (Klondike (solitaire), Strange Adventures in Infinite Space). Many games become more challenging if the player is successful. For instance, real-time strategy games often feature "upkeep", a resource tax that scales with the number of units under a player's control.[10] Team games which challenge players to invade their opponents' territory (football, capture the flag) have a feedback loop by default: the further a player pushes, the more opponents they are likely to face. Feedback loops can lead to frequent ties if enforced too strictly. See also Dynamic game difficulty balancing. A game can be balanced dynamically by a gamemaster who observes players and adjusts the game in response to their emotional state (Dungeons & Dragons, Left 4 Dead). Although gamemasters have historically been humans, some videogames now feature AI systems that perform a similar role by monitoring player ability and inferring emotional state from input.[4] Research into biofeedback peripherals is set to greatly improve the accuracy of such systems.[11] In role-playing game slang, a "gimp" is a character, character class or character ability that is underpowered in the context of the game. Gimped characters lack effectiveness compared to other characters at a similar level of experience.[12] A player may gimp a character by assigning skills and abilities that are inappropriate for the character class, or by developing the character inefficiently.[13] However, this is not always the case, as some characters are purposely "gimped" by the game's developers in order to provide an incentive for raising their level, or, conversely, to give the player an early head-start. An example of this is Final Fantasy's Mystic Knight class, which starts out weak, but is able to become the most powerful class if brought to a very high level. Gimps may also be accidental on the part of the developer, and may require a software patch to rebalance. Sometimes, especially in MMORPGs, gimp is used as a synonym for nerf to describe a rule modification that weakens the affected target. Unlike the connotatively neutral term nerf[citation needed], gimp in this usage often implies that the rule change unfairly disadvantages the target.[14] A "nerf" is a change to a game that reduces the desirability or effectiveness of a particular game element. The term is also used as a verb for the act of making such a change.[15] The first established use of the term was in Ultima Online, as a reference to the NERF brand of toys which are soft and less likely to cause serious injury.[16][17] Among game developers, MMORPG designers are especially likely to nerf aspects of a game in order to maintain game balance. Occasionally a new feature (such as an item, class, or skill) may be made too powerful, too cheap, or too easily obtained to the extent that it unbalances the game system. This is sometimes due to an unforeseen bug or method of using or acquiring the object that was not considered by the developers.[16][18] The frequency of nerfing and the scale of nerfing vary widely from game to game but almost all massively multiplayer games have engaged in nerfing at some point.[18] Nerfs in various online games, including Anarchy Online, have spurred in-world protests.[17] Since many items in virtual worlds are sold or traded among players, a nerf may have an outsized impact on the virtual economy. As players respond, the nerf may cause prices to fluctuate before settling down in a different equilibrium. This impact on the economy, along with the original impact of the nerf, can cause large player resentment for even a small change.[17][18] In particular, in the case of items or abilities which have been nerfed, players can become upset over the perceived wasted efforts in obtaining the now nerfed features.[17][18] A well-known instance in which a nerf has caused many protests, but much more praise, is when Infinity Ward nerfed the Model 1887s in its video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Before the nerf, the Model 1887s were able to One Shot Kill from medium-long range when all other shotguns in game were limited to short-medium range. The nerfing of the Model 1887s reduced its range to short range. For games where avatars and items represent significant economic value, this may bring up legal issues over the lost value.[19] Overpowered (often abbreviated to OP) is a common term referring to a perceived lack of game balance. It is often used when describing a specific class in an RPG, a specific faction in strategic games, or a specific tactic, ability, weapon or unit in various games. For something to be deemed overpowered, it is either the best choice in a disproportionate number of situations (marginalising other choices) and/or excessively hard to counter by the opponent compared to the effort required to use it.

Content:
Festus Walters (18491922) was an Ohio jurist and advocate for Gubernatorial judicial independence known for the controversial decision to try an Ohio National Guard commander for murder following the Washington County Courthouse riots of 1895. Among the Ohio Five arriving at Cornell University when that revolutionary institution opened its doors, he was life-long friends with fellow Cornellian and fraternity brother, Senator Joseph B. Foraker. In 1898, the official history of the Republican Party in Ohio stated that [t]he Republican party may well be judged by its degree of intelligence, its usefulness and safety in the management of public affairs, and its achievements during the forty years of its existence. It is a party of principle, and though its opponents may criticise its doctrines they cannot deny that it has always had the courage of its convictions. As long as it continues it will attract to its ranks men of brilliant minds and intellectual giants who give freely of their great gifts to aid the maintenance of a party that has done so much for the prosperity of the country. Ohio has in the past contributed her share of famous men, and as the years roll on the names of others are added one by one to the rapidly increasing list. One that has become prominently associated with the political history of the state is that of Judge Festus Walters . . . personally the Judge is courteous and affable, and is an excellent entertainer, though not a society man in the strict sense of the word.[1] Festus Walters descended in the maternal line from the Peters family of Fairfield, County, Ohio. It is unknown when the eponymous Peters ancestor landed in America, or from what country. Like many whose descendants settled southern Ohio, he settled in Philadelphia, married, and sired two sons born in Philadelphia, Jacob and Henry. Henry died without issue. Jacob married. He moved south to Baltimore, raising three sons and one daughter. The daughter married a man named Burns. The sons were John, Jacob and Samuel. Samuel, son of Jacob and the ancestor of Ohios Judge Festus Walters, was born in Philadelphia on September 27, 1772. He died at his home in Amanda township, Fairfield County, Ohio, September 10, 1829. His wife was Mary Stevenson, daughter of Daniel Stevenson, of Baltimore County, Maryland. She was born September 28, 1773, and died in Fairfield County, February 15, 1861, aged 87 years. Their oldest son, Henry Peters, was born October 1, 1796. They trekked to the Ohio valley in April, 1812, and lived for five years on what became the Frank Stevenson farm. Daniel Stevenson was born September 21, 1737 and died September 3, 1829. Ruth, his wife, was born January 24, 1743, and died January 12, 1834. They were the parents of ten children. They came to Ohio several years before Peters and his wife. The wife of Samuel Peters was a model woman and mother. She was a daughter of Daniel Stevenson, one of the early pioneers of Richland township, and on whose land the first Methodist church in the county was erected. The old homestead remained in the Stevenson family for many years. A grandson of Daniel was the landsman when Festus Walters was sitting on the Ohio bench. There were several brothers and sisters of the Stevenson family, Daniel, Jesse, Mordecai, Edward, Mrs. Peters  who was Judge Walters grandmother  and Mrs. Hampson were those most remembered; most of them were born in Maryland and came to Ohio with their father as early as 1803. Daniel Stevenson, the pioneer and father of this large family, was a very prominent man of the Republics early days and much respected for his sterling character. He was a Methodist and donated land for the first church in the county. He entertained the evangelist Bishop Asbury during his visits to Fairfield County, and it was on his land where Asbury conducted the first camp meeting held in the county. The early church was constructed of hewn logs, carved with big broad axes, and with a skill available to a select few of the pioneer workman, and with what skill the corner men could notch the logs perfectly, and carry up their corner, a perilous job, but performed by hundreds of men. With respect to the Peters family, Mr. Peters and wife arrived in the Ohio valley in 1812. They settled two miles north of West Rushville, on Rush Creek, at the mouth of Snake run. The Peters remained on Rush Creek for about five years. They purchased land south of Royalton later owned by Benjamin Haas, cut a farm and endured the hardships incidental to pioneer life. Here they spent their lives, living the quiet life of farmers and rearing a large family of children. Mr. Peters was a man of sterling character and possessed good business sense. Peters was prominent and beloved in his neighborhood, and exerted an influence in the community far above the average. His success in rearing a large family to honorable and useful lives, is evidence of many good qualities and ability as a parent. His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921. At the close of his second term, Robert Z. Buchwalter, son of his fraternity brother, Judge Morris Lyons Buchwalter, was elected to serve on the First Circuit for a term starting February 9, 1921.[8] The year after Judge Walters stepped down from the bench, he died. His judicial career included long sessions on the Court of Common Pleas, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Appeals.

Daniele Matias Hyplito (born September 8, 1984) is a Brazilian gymnast who competed in the 2000, 2004 and 2008 Summer Olympics. Hyplito was the first athlete from Brazil ever to win a medal at the World Championships, a silver on floor exercise in 2001.[1] She is also the nine-time senior all-around Brazilian National Champion in artistic gymnastics, 2002 South American Games all-around champion and 2003 Pan American Games all-around bronze medalist. To date Hyplito has represented Brazil at the World Championships seven times, competing in every Worlds meet from 1999 to 2007, as well as the 1999, 2003 and 2007 Pan American Games. Hyplito was born in Santo Andr, So Paulo to parents Wagner and Geni.[1] Her younger brother, Diego, is also a world-class gymnast. In 2005 he became the first male Brazilian gymnast to win a World Championships medal, earning gold on the floor exercise. Training in Rio de Janeiro, Hyplito was competing internationally by the time she was 10 years old. As a junior, she won the all-around in the Junior Pan Am Games in 1998 and the Canberra Cup in 1999. Hyplito placed a modest 27th in the all-around at the 1999 World Gymnastics Championships, but helped Brazil qualify athletes to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. She was chosen to represent Brazil at the Olympics and qualified for the all-around final, finishing in 20th place.[1] In 2001, Hyplito made dramatic improvements. At that year's World Championships, she placed fourth in the all-around, scoring 9.056 on vault, 8.912 on bars, 9.375 on beam and 9.562 on floor. Until Jade Barbosa's bronze medal win at the 2007 World Championships, this placement was the highest AA finish ever achieved by a Brazilian gymnast in Worlds or Olympic competition. Hyplito followed up her strong AA showing by winning Brazil's first ever gymnastics medal, a silver, in the floor exercise event final (9.487). She continued to do well in 2002, winning the all-around and every event final gold except uneven bars at the South American Games and placing 5th on floor at the World Championships (9.237). At the 2003 World Championships Hyplito placed last in the all-around after injuring herself on her first event, however, she helped Brazil qualify a full team for the 2004 Olympics. At the Olympics, Hyplito competed well, helping the Brazilian team to a ninth place finish and placing 12th in the all-around. Hyplito placed 9th in the all-around at the 2005 World Championships. In 2006 she won her ninth national championships. She also won the silver medal on balance beam at the 2006 World Cup Finals, one of the major events on the FIG calendar, that took place in So Paulo, Brazil. In 2007, Hyplito placed second in the all-around at the Brazilian National Championships and won the floor exercise title. She was a member of the silver medal-winning Brazilian team at the 2007 Pan American Games, where she placed 5th in the all-around and won a bronze medal on beam. She scored 15.375, while the silver-medalist Nastia Liukin got 15.9 and the gold-medalist, Shawn, scored 16.15.[2] She also participated in the 2007 World Championships, where she helped the Brazilian team to its highest placing ever, fifth in the team finals. She also competed at the 2007 Arthur Gander Memorial Cup in Switzerland, where she placed 4th all-around and won a bronze medal on floor. In 2008, Hyplito left the National Training Center in Curitiba to return to her home club, Flamengo, in Rio de Janeiro.[3] At the 2008 Brazilian National Championships, she placed first on the balance beam, second on floor, and third in the all-around and vault.[4] At the Olympics, Hyplito competed on three eventsbars, beam and floor exercisein the preliminary round of competition.[5] In the team finals, she competed on balance beam and uneven bars, contributing scores of 14.925 and 14.625 to the Brazilian team's 8th place finish.[6] In 2010, back to important competitions, she competed in 2010 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. She placed 18th in All Around Final and 10th in team final. In 2011, Daniele helped Brazilian team to place 14th in 2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. She also improved her individual result, placing 13th in All Around Final. In 2011 Pan American Games, Daniele won two bronze medals: on floor (13.75) and on beam (13.75). She placed 5th in Team Competition (behind USA, Canada, Mexico and Colombia) and 7th in All Around Comepetition. [1] In 2012, her first competition was in 2012 Gymnastics Olympic Test Event. She helped Brazilian Team to qualify in 4th for the 2012 Olympic Games. In the event finals, she scored 14.066 on vault and placed fourth. Her teammate Jade Barbosa won the gold. On floor, she received 13.733 and was 8th. Vanessa Ferrari was the champion. [2].

The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921. At the close of his second term, Robert Z. Buchwalter, son of his fraternity brother, Judge Morris Lyons Buchwalter, was elected to serve on the First Circuit for a term starting February 9, 1921.[8] The year after Judge Walters stepped down from the bench, he died. His judicial career included long sessions on the Court of Common Pleas, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Appeals.

Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer.

Content:
Kokkola (Swedish: Karleby) is a town and municipality of Finland. The town is located in the province of Western Finland and is part of the Central Ostrobothnia region. The town has a population of 46,602 (31 January 2012)[2] and covers an area of 2,730.81 square kilometres (1,054.37sqmi) of which 1,286.61km2 (496.76sqmi) is water.[1] The population density is 32.27 inhabitants per square kilometre (83.6/sqmi). The municipality is bilingual with 84.2% being Finnish and 13.9% Swedish speakers. The Finnish name Kokkola means "place of bonfire" or "place of eagle" because the Finnish root word kokko means both bonfire and white-tailed eagle (the suffix -la denotes location). The town was known in Swedish by the name Gamlakarleby until 1 January 1977 when the surrounding land municipality of Kaarlela (Swedish: Karleby) was consolidated with Kokkola, and the town took over the Swedish name of Karleby. The word gamla means "old", karl means "man" or "peasant" and by means "village", in tearn literally meaning '"old village of peasants" or Anglicised as "Old Peasantville". The Latin name was Carolina Vetus. Results of the Finnish parliamentary election, 2011 in Kokkola: Kokkola is located on the coast of Gulf of Bothnia, and the coastal European route E8 (Finnish highway 8) goes through, connecting Oulu and Turku via Vaasa. Finnish highway 28 begins from Kokkola and runs to Kajaani. Finnish highway 13 begins from Kokkola and runs through Finland into the Nuijamaa border crossing via Jyvskyl and Mikkeli. The scenic '7 Bridges Archipelago Road' (road 749) runs along the coast between Kokkola and Jakobstad. Kokkola-Pietarsaari Airport is situated 22 kilometres (14mi) from Kokkola in Kronoby (Finnish: Kruunupyy). The Kokkola railway station is a stop along Line 7, with service between Helsinki and Kemijrvi via Tampere and Seinjoki, where the fast Pendolino bullet train operates. There is no passenger ferry traffic from Kokkola. The town of Kokkola was chartered in 1620 by king Gustav II Adolf of Sweden, when Finland was a part of the Swedish Empire. Kokkola was founded as a shipping port for the tar trade. It also became an important shipbuilding centre in Finland. As a result of tar trade and shipbuilding industry Kokkola was for a time the richest town in Finland.[citation needed] An interesting historical affair, known as the Skirmish of Halkokari, occurred at the town of Kokkola in June 1854 during the Crimean War. Royal Marines from HMS Vulture and HMS Odin tried to come ashore to ransack the town, but were repelled by local defenders, of which many were civilians armed with hunting rifles. One of the 9 smaller British craft (a gunboat) fell into the hands of the defenders. As such, this boat was the only Royal Navy vessel still in foreign possession in 1914. The boat is still today a museum-object and can be seen in Kokkola's English Park. The town council has refused to return the boat despite several requests by the United Kingdom, most recently by John Stuttard, the Lord Mayor of London. The British Treasury annually pays a small sum for the maintenance of nine graves of nine Royal Marines killed in action during the skirmish to the local church congregation.[6] The city had a Swedish-speaking majority until 1933. In 1977, the surrounding municipality of Kaarlela (Swedish: Karleby) was consolidated into Kokkola (Swedish until then: Gamlakarleby). In 2009, the municipalities of Lohtaja, Klvi and Ullava were consolidated with Kokkola. Kokkola is the capital and only city in the region of Central Ostrobothnia. The chemical industry is a major employer. An industrial area and a port is located in Ykspihlaja. OMG has a cobalt plant and Boliden has a zinc plant in there. Kemira, a chemical conglomerate, built an industrial park that is now divided between several corporations. The area has Kemira's own sulfuric acid plant, a Kemira GrowHow site, KemFine's fine chemicals plant, Tetra Chemicals calcium chloride plant and a Nordkalk plant. In addition, industries represented in the town include metalworking, casting, textiles, plastics, food and carpentry. Largest employers are as follows:[7] The port of Kokkola is located in Ykspihlaja, approximately 5km (3mi) from the city center, and it is one of the busiest ports in Finland. Oil, ore and limestone are imported, refined products and timber are exported, and iron ore is transited.

The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921.

The municipality is bilingual with 84.2% being Finnish and 13.9% Swedish speakers. The Finnish name Kokkola means "place of bonfire" or "place of eagle" because the Finnish root word kokko means both bonfire and white-tailed eagle (the suffix -la denotes location). The town was known in Swedish by the name Gamlakarleby until 1 January 1977 when the surrounding land municipality of Kaarlela (Swedish: Karleby) was consolidated with Kokkola, and the town took over the Swedish name of Karleby. The word gamla means "old", karl means "man" or "peasant" and by means "village", in tearn literally meaning '"old village of peasants" or Anglicised as "Old Peasantville". The Latin name was Carolina Vetus. Results of the Finnish parliamentary election, 2011 in Kokkola: Kokkola is located on the coast of Gulf of Bothnia, and the coastal European route E8 (Finnish highway 8) goes through, connecting Oulu and Turku via Vaasa. Finnish highway 28 begins from Kokkola and runs to Kajaani. Finnish highway 13 begins from Kokkola and runs through Finland into the Nuijamaa border crossing via Jyvskyl and Mikkeli. The scenic '7 Bridges Archipelago Road' (road 749) runs along the coast between Kokkola and Jakobstad. Kokkola-Pietarsaari Airport is situated 22 kilometres (14mi) from Kokkola in Kronoby (Finnish: Kruunupyy). The Kokkola railway station is a stop along Line 7, with service between Helsinki and Kemijrvi via Tampere and Seinjoki, where the fast Pendolino bullet train operates. There is no passenger ferry traffic from Kokkola. The town of Kokkola was chartered in 1620 by king Gustav II Adolf of Sweden, when Finland was a part of the Swedish Empire. Kokkola was founded as a shipping port for the tar trade. It also became an important shipbuilding centre in Finland. As a result of tar trade and shipbuilding industry Kokkola was for a time the richest town in Finland.[citation needed] An interesting historical affair, known as the Skirmish of Halkokari, occurred at the town of Kokkola in June 1854 during the Crimean War. Royal Marines from HMS Vulture and HMS Odin tried to come ashore to ransack the town, but were repelled by local defenders, of which many were civilians armed with hunting rifles. One of the 9 smaller British craft (a gunboat) fell into the hands of the defenders. As such, this boat was the only Royal Navy vessel still in foreign possession in 1914. The boat is still today a museum-object and can be seen in Kokkola's English Park. The town council has refused to return the boat despite several requests by the United Kingdom, most recently by John Stuttard, the Lord Mayor of London. The British Treasury annually pays a small sum for the maintenance of nine graves of nine Royal Marines killed in action during the skirmish to the local church congregation.[6] The city had a Swedish-speaking majority until 1933. In 1977, the surrounding municipality of Kaarlela (Swedish: Karleby) was consolidated into Kokkola (Swedish until then: Gamlakarleby). In 2009, the municipalities of Lohtaja, Klvi and Ullava were consolidated with Kokkola. Kokkola is the capital and only city in the region of Central Ostrobothnia. The chemical industry is a major employer. An industrial area and a port is located in Ykspihlaja. OMG has a cobalt plant and Boliden has a zinc plant in there. Kemira, a chemical conglomerate, built an industrial park that is now divided between several corporations. The area has Kemira's own sulfuric acid plant, a Kemira GrowHow site, KemFine's fine chemicals plant, Tetra Chemicals calcium chloride plant and a Nordkalk plant. In addition, industries represented in the town include metalworking, casting, textiles, plastics, food and carpentry. Largest employers are as follows:[7] The port of Kokkola is located in Ykspihlaja, approximately 5km (3mi) from the city center, and it is one of the busiest ports in Finland. Oil, ore and limestone are imported, refined products and timber are exported, and iron ore is transited.

His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him.

"Brothers & Sisters" is a song by Coldplay, released as their first single in 1999 following the release of the bands first EP Safety, released a year earlier. It was later re-released as an EP. After forming in 1998, Coldplay met up with local record label Fierce Panda Records after a representative from said label saw them perform at the Camden Falcon in December of that year. Fierce Panda offered to release their debut single, and the band agreed, signing a short record deal.[1][2] 1,500 copies of the vinyl single were issued in a special wraparound picture sleeve. It peaked at #107 on the UK Singles Chart. According to the singles liner notes, recording completed in only four days and cost the band a lowly sum of 400.[1] The atmospheric sounds on "Easy to Please" were created by setting up microphones on a wet road outside the studio.[2] A new version of "Brothers & Sisters" later appeared on the "Trouble" single. The single was re-released as an EP in late 2002 on Brash Records.

ÿamden Falcon in December of that year. Fierce Panda offered to release their debut single, and the band agreed, signing a short record deal.[1][2] 1,500 copies of the vinyl single were issued in a special wraparound picture sleeve. It peaked at #107 on the UK Singles Chart. According to the singles liner notes, recording completed in only four days and cost the band a lowly sum of 400.[1] The atmospheric sounds on "Easy to Please" were created by setting up microphones on a wet road outside the studio.[2] A new version of "Brothers & Sisters" later appeared on the "Trouble" single. The single was re-released as an EP in late 2002 on Brash Records.

ÿs "Old Peasantville". The Latin name was Carolina Vetus. Results of the Finnish parliamentary election, 2011 in Kokkola: Kokkola is located on the coast of Gulf of Bothnia, and the coastal European route E8 (Finnish highway 8) goes through, connecting Oulu and Turku via Vaasa. Finnish highway 28 begins from Kokkola and runs to Kajaani. Finnish highway 13 begins from Kokkola and runs through Finland into the Nuijamaa border crossing via Jyvskyl and Mikkeli. The scenic '7 Bridges Archipelago Road' (road 749) runs along the coast between Kokkola and Jakobstad. Kokkola-Pietarsaari Airport is situated 22 kilometres (14mi) from Kokkola in Kronoby (Finnish: Kruunupyy). The Kokkola railway station is a stop along Line 7, with service between Helsinki and Kemijrvi via Tampere and Seinjoki, where the fast Pendolino bullet train operates. There is no passenger ferry traffic from Kokkola. The town of Kokkola was chartered in 1620 by king Gustav II Adolf of Sweden, when Finland was a part of the Swedish Empire. Kokkola was founded as a shipping port for the tar trade. It also became an important shipbuilding centre in Finland. As a result of tar trade and shipbuilding industry Kokkola was for a time the richest town in Finland.[citation needed] An interesting historical affair, known as the Skirmish of Halkokari, occurred at the town of Kokkola in June 1854 during the Crimean War. Royal Marines from HMS Vulture and HMS Odin tried to come ashore to ransack the town, but were repelled by local defenders, of which many were civilians armed with hunting rifles. One of the 9 smaller British craft (a gunboat) fell into the hands of the defenders. As such, this boat was the only Royal Navy vessel still in foreign possession in 1914. The boat is still today a museum-object and can be seen in Kokkola's English Park. The town council has refused to return the boat despite several requests by the United Kingdom, most recently by John Stuttard, the Lord Mayor of London. The British Treasury annually pays a small sum for the maintenance of nine graves of nine Royal Marines killed in action during the skirmish to the local church congregation.[6] The city had a Swedish-speaking majority until 1933. In 1977, the surrounding municipality of Kaarlela (Swedish: Karleby) was consolidated into Kokkola (Swedish until then: Gamlakarleby). In 2009, the municipalities of Lohtaja, Klvi and Ullava were consolidated with Kokkola. Kokkola is the capital and only city in the region of Central Ostrobothnia. The chemical industry is a major employer. An industrial area and a port is located in Ykspihlaja. OMG has a cobalt plant and Boliden has a zinc plant in there. Kemira, a chemical conglomerate, built an industrial park that is now divided between several corporations. The area has Kemira's own sulfuric acid plant, a Kemira GrowHow site, KemFine's fine chemicals plant, Tetra Chemicals calcium chloride plant and a Nordkalk plant. In addition, industries represented in the town include metalworking, casting, textiles, plastics, food and carpentry. Largest employers are as follows:[7] The port of Kokkola is located in Ykspihlaja, approximately 5km (3mi) from the city center, and it is one of the busiest ports in Finland. Oil, ore and limestone are imported, refined products and timber are exported, and iron ore is transited.

ÿr above the average. His success in rearing a large family to honorable and useful lives, is evidence of many good qualities and ability as a parent. His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921. At the close of his second term, Robert Z. Buchwalter, son of his fraternity brother, Judge Morris Lyons Buchwalter, was elected to serve on the First Circuit for a term starting February 9, 1921.[8] The year after Judge Walters stepped down from the bench, he died. His judicial career included long sessions on the Court of Common Pleas, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Appeals.

Subject: Mansi language 
To: April
Content:
The Mansi language (also Vogul, although this is obsolete, and "Maansi") is a language of the Mansi people. It is spoken in territories of Russia along the Ob River and its tributaries, including the KhantyMansi Autonomous Okrug and the Sverdlovsk Oblast. According to the 1989 census, there were 3,184 Mansi-speaking people in Russia. The base dialect of the Mansi literary language is the Sosva dialect, a representative of the northern dialect; the discussion below is based on the standard language. Fixed word order is typical in Mansi. Adverbials and participles play an important role in sentence construction. The written language was first published in 1868 and in 1937 was revised using a form of Cyrillic. The Mansi language is subdivided into four main dialects which are to a large degree mutually unintelligible, and therefore best considered four languages. Northern Mansi (Sosva, Upper Lozyvin) has strong Russian, Komi, Nenets, and Northern Khanty influence. There is no accusative case; that is, both the nominative and accusative roles are unmarked on the noun. *// and *// have been backed to [a] and [a]. Western Mansi (Pelym, Vagily, Middle and Lower Lazyvin) went extinct ca. 2000. It had strong Russian and Komi influences. Long vowels were diphthongized. Eastern Mansi (Kondin) is spoken by 100200 people. It has Khanty and Tatar influence. There is vowel harmony, and for *// it has [], frequently diphthongized. Southern Mansi (Tavdin) went extinct ca. 1900. It had vowel harmony and a strong Tatar influence and displayed several archaisms such as retention of /y/ (elsewhere merged with *//), /ts/ (elsewhere deaffricated to /s/), and /a/ (elsewhere raised to /o/). The first publication of the written Mansi language was a translation of the Gospel of Matthew published in London in 1868. In 1932 a version of Latin alphabet was introduced with little success. The former Latin alphabet: In 1937, Cyrillic replaced the Latin. Mansi is an agglutinating, SOV language.[2] There are two articles in Mansi: definite  (a), which also means "now" when placed before verbs, and indefinite  (ak), literally "one".[3] There is no grammatical gender. Mansi distinguishes between singular, dual and plural number. Six grammatical cases exist. Possession is expressed using possessive suffixes, for example -, which means "my". Example with:  /put/ (cauldron) Missing cases can be expressed using postpositions, such as  (alnl, 'of, out of'),  (sait, 'after, behind'), etc. Mansi conjugation has three persons, three numbers, two tenses, and four moods. Active and passive voices exist. Intransitive and transitive conjugations are distinguished. This means that there are two possible ways of conjugating a verb. When the speaker conjugates in intransitive, the sentence has no concrete object (in this case, the object is nothing or something like something, anything). In the transitive conjugation, there is a concrete object. This feature also exists in the other Ugric languages. Mansi uses suffixes to express the tense. The tense suffix precedes the personal suffix. The language has no future tense; the future is expressed in other ways. There are four moods: indicative, conditional, imperative and precative. Indicative mood has no suffix. Imperative mood exists only in the second person. The suffixes are the following: Thus, the conjugation of the verb  (lat. mina [go]), in past tense (remember the suffix -): Verbs have active and passive voice. Active voice has no suffix; the suffix to express the passive is --. Verbal prefixes are used to modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways. For example, with the prefix - (el-) (away, off) the verb  (mina) (go) becomes  (elmina), which means to go away. This is surprisingly close to the Hungarian equivalents: el- (away) and menni (to go), where elmenni is to go away l(a)  'forwards, onwards, away' ot  'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity' Numbers 1 and 2 also have attributive forms:  (1) and  (2); compare with Hungarian kt, and Old Hungarian "kit").    .  I went fishing (literally "I fish catch went"). Here are some invented sentences in Northern Mansi (IPA transcription) and Hungarian. They demonstrate well the relationship between Hungarian and Mansi.

Indicative mood has no suffix. Imperative mood exists only in the second person. The suffixes are the following: Thus, the conjugation of the verb  (lat. mina [go]), in past tense (remember the suffix -): Verbs have active and passive voice. Active voice has no suffix; the suffix to express the passive is --. Verbal prefixes are used to modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways. For example, with the prefix - (el-) (away, off) the verb  (mina) (go) becomes  (elmina), which means to go away. This is surprisingly close to the Hungarian equivalents: el- (away) and menni (to go), where elmenni is to go away l(a)  'forwards, onwards, away' ot  'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity' Numbers 1 and 2 also have attributive forms:  (1) and  (2); compare with Hungarian kt, and Old Hungarian "kit").    .

ÿr above the average. His success in rearing a large family to honorable and useful lives, is evidence of many good qualities and ability as a parent. His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921. At the close of his second term, Robert Z. Buchwalter, son of his fraternity brother, Judge Morris Lyons Buchwalter, was elected to serve on the First Circuit for a term starting February 9, 1921.[8] The year after Judge Walters stepped down from the bench, he died. His judicial career included long sessions on the Court of Common Pleas, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Appeals.

ÿributaries, including the KhantyMansi Autonomous Okrug and the Sverdlovsk Oblast. According to the 1989 census, there were 3,184 Mansi-speaking people in Russia. The base dialect of the Mansi literary language is the Sosva dialect, a representative of the northern dialect; the discussion below is based on the standard language. Fixed word order is typical in Mansi. Adverbials and participles play an important role in sentence construction. The written language was first published in 1868 and in 1937 was revised using a form of Cyrillic. The Mansi language is subdivided into four main dialects which are to a large degree mutually unintelligible, and therefore best considered four languages. Northern Mansi (Sosva, Upper Lozyvin) has strong Russian, Komi, Nenets, and Northern Khanty influence. There is no accusative case; that is, both the nominative and accusative roles are unmarked on the noun. *// and *// have been backed to [a] and [a]. Western Mansi (Pelym, Vagily, Middle and Lower Lazyvin) went extinct ca. 2000. It had strong Russian and Komi influences. Long vowels were diphthongized. Eastern Mansi (Kondin) is spoken by 100200 people. It has Khanty and Tatar influence. There is vowel harmony, and for *// it has [], frequently diphthongized. Southern Mansi (Tavdin) went extinct ca. 1900. It had vowel harmony and a strong Tatar influence and displayed several archaisms such as retention of /y/ (elsewhere merged with *//), /ts/ (elsewhere deaffricated to /s/), and /a/ (elsewhere raised to /o/). The first publication of the written Mansi language was a translation of the Gospel of Matthew published in London in 1868. In 1932 a version of Latin alphabet was introduced with little success. The former Latin alphabet: In 1937, Cyrillic replaced the Latin. Mansi is an agglutinating, SOV language.[2] There are two articles in Mansi: definite  (a), which also means "now" when placed before verbs, and indefinite  (ak), literally "one".[3] There is no grammatical gender. Mansi distinguishes between singular, dual and plural number. Six grammatical cases exist. Possession is expressed using possessive suffixes, for example -, which means "my". Example with:  /put/ (cauldron) Missing cases can be expressed using postpositions, such as  (alnl, 'of, out of'),  (sait, 'after, behind'), etc. Mansi conjugation has three persons, three numbers, two tenses, and four moods. Active and passive voices exist. Intransitive and transitive conjugations are distinguished. This means that there are two possible ways of conjugating a verb. When the speaker conjugates in intransitive, the sentence has no concrete object (in this case, the object is nothing or something like something, anything). In the transitive conjugation, there is a concrete object. This feature also exists in the other Ugric languages. Mansi uses suffixes to express the tense. The tense suffix precedes the personal suffix. The language has no future tense; the future is expressed in other ways. There are four moods: indicative, conditional, imperative and precative.

He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921. At the close of his second term, Robert Z. Buchwalter, son of his fraternity brother, Judge Morris Lyons Buchwalter, was elected to serve on the First Circuit for a term starting February 9, 1921.[8] The year after Judge Walters stepped down from the bench, he died. His judicial career included long sessions on the Court of Common Pleas, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Appeals.

Subject: Butler Transit Authority 
To: Lucine
Content:
Butler Transit Authority, operating as TheBus, is a public transportation service located in Butler, Pennsylvania. The goal of the service is to provide mass transit access for the central portion of the county. However, no bus routes run to the heavily suburbanized southern portion of the county. The Port Authority of Allegheny County provides several bus routes that terminate just south of the rapidly growing suburb of Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania (providing park and ride options), but no fixed bus lines traverse this area. The agency does not provides its own commuter access to Pittsburgh. Instead, the private Myers Coach Lines is in charge of this service on weekdays and coordinates its stops with the transit authority. The Pittsburgh service also travels to a 35 space park and ride lot in Penn Township.

ÿMansi (Sosva, Upper Lozyvin) has strong Russian, Komi, Nenets, and Northern Khanty influence. There is no accusative case; that is, both the nominative and accusative roles are unmarked on the noun. *// and *// have been backed to [a] and [a]. Western Mansi (Pelym, Vagily, Middle and Lower Lazyvin) went extinct ca. 2000. It had strong Russian and Komi influences. Long vowels were diphthongized. Eastern Mansi (Kondin) is spoken by 100200 people. It has Khanty and Tatar influence. There is vowel harmony, and for *// it has [], frequently diphthongized. Southern Mansi (Tavdin) went extinct ca. 1900. It had vowel harmony and a strong Tatar influence and displayed several archaisms such as retention of /y/ (elsewhere merged with *//), /ts/ (elsewhere deaffricated to /s/), and /a/ (elsewhere raised to /o/). The first publication of the written Mansi language was a translation of the Gospel of Matthew published in London in 1868. In 1932 a version of Latin alphabet was introduced with little success. The former Latin alphabet: In 1937, Cyrillic replaced the Latin. Mansi is an agglutinating, SOV language.[2] There are two articles in Mansi: definite  (a), which also means "now" when placed before verbs, and indefinite  (ak), literally "one".[3] There is no grammatical gender. Mansi distinguishes between singular, dual and plural number. Six grammatical cases exist. Possession is expressed using possessive suffixes, for example -, which means "my". Example with:  /put/ (cauldron) Missing cases can be expressed using postpositions, such as  (alnl, 'of, out of'),  (sait, 'after, behind'), etc. Mansi conjugation has three persons, three numbers, two tenses, and four moods. Active and passive voices exist. Intransitive and transitive conjugations are distinguished. This means that there are two possible ways of conjugating a verb. When the speaker conjugates in intransitive, the sentence has no concrete object (in this case, the object is nothing or something like something, anything). In the transitive conjugation, there is a concrete object. This feature also exists in the other Ugric languages. Mansi uses suffixes to express the tense. The tense suffix precedes the personal suffix. The language has no future tense; the future is expressed in other ways. There are four moods: indicative, conditional, imperative and precative. Indicative mood has no suffix. Imperative mood exists only in the second person. The suffixes are the following: Thus, the conjugation of the verb  (lat. mina [go]), in past tense (remember the suffix -): Verbs have active and passive voice. Active voice has no suffix; the suffix to express the passive is --. Verbal prefixes are used to modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways. For example, with the prefix - (el-) (away, off) the verb  (mina) (go) becomes  (elmina), which means to go away. This is surprisingly close to the Hungarian equivalents: el- (away) and menni (to go), where elmenni is to go away l(a)  'forwards, onwards, away' ot  'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity' Numbers 1 and 2 also have attributive forms:  (1) and  (2); compare with Hungarian kt, and Old Hungarian "kit").    .

His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921. At the close of his second term, Robert Z. Buchwalter, son of his fraternity brother, Judge Morris Lyons Buchwalter, was elected to serve on the First Circuit for a term starting February 9, 1921.[8] The year after Judge Walters stepped down from the bench, he died. His judicial career included long sessions on the Court of Common Pleas, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Appeals.

Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 150 (P. Oxy. 150 or P. Oxy. I 150) is a receipt, written in Greek and discovered in Oxyrhynchus. The manuscript was written on papyrus in the form of a sheet. The document was written on 7 October 590. Currently it is housed in the Egyptian Museum (10051) in Cairo.[1] The document is a receipt showing that Phoebammon, a butler, had paid 3.5 jars of wine "to the 14 bucellarii of Heracleopolis and Koma who had come on account of the fight..."[2] The measurements of the fragment are 63 by 322 mm.[2] It was discovered by Grenfell and Hunt in 1897 in Oxyrhynchus. The text was published by Grenfell and Hunt in 1898.[2] This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:Grenfell, B. P.; A. S. Hunt (1898). Oxyrhynchus Papyri I.

ÿansi (Pelym, Vagily, Middle and Lower Lazyvin) went extinct ca. 2000. It had strong Russian and Komi influences. Long vowels were diphthongized. Eastern Mansi (Kondin) is spoken by 100200 people. It has Khanty and Tatar influence. There is vowel harmony, and for *// it has [], frequently diphthongized. Southern Mansi (Tavdin) went extinct ca. 1900. It had vowel harmony and a strong Tatar influence and displayed several archaisms such as retention of /y/ (elsewhere merged with *//), /ts/ (elsewhere deaffricated to /s/), and /a/ (elsewhere raised to /o/). The first publication of the written Mansi language was a translation of the Gospel of Matthew published in London in 1868. In 1932 a version of Latin alphabet was introduced with little success. The former Latin alphabet: In 1937, Cyrillic replaced the Latin. Mansi is an agglutinating, SOV language.[2] There are two articles in Mansi: definite  (a), which also means "now" when placed before verbs, and indefinite  (ak), literally "one".[3] There is no grammatical gender. Mansi distinguishes between singular, dual and plural number. Six grammatical cases exist. Possession is expressed using possessive suffixes, for example -, which means "my". Example with:  /put/ (cauldron) Missing cases can be expressed using postpositions, such as  (alnl, 'of, out of'),  (sait, 'after, behind'), etc. Mansi conjugation has three persons, three numbers, two tenses, and four moods. Active and passive voices exist. Intransitive and transitive conjugations are distinguished. This means that there are two possible ways of conjugating a verb. When the speaker conjugates in intransitive, the sentence has no concrete object (in this case, the object is nothing or something like something, anything). In the transitive conjugation, there is a concrete object. This feature also exists in the other Ugric languages. Mansi uses suffixes to express the tense. The tense suffix precedes the personal suffix. The language has no future tense; the future is expressed in other ways. There are four moods: indicative, conditional, imperative and precative. Indicative mood has no suffix. Imperative mood exists only in the second person. The suffixes are the following: Thus, the conjugation of the verb  (lat. mina [go]), in past tense (remember the suffix -): Verbs have active and passive voice. Active voice has no suffix; the suffix to express the passive is --. Verbal prefixes are used to modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways. For example, with the prefix - (el-) (away, off) the verb  (mina) (go) becomes  (elmina), which means to go away. This is surprisingly close to the Hungarian equivalents: el- (away) and menni (to go), where elmenni is to go away l(a)  'forwards, onwards, away' ot  'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity' Numbers 1 and 2 also have attributive forms:  (1) and  (2); compare with Hungarian kt, and Old Hungarian "kit").    .

His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son.

Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921. At the close of his second term, Robert Z. Buchwalter, son of his fraternity brother, Judge Morris Lyons Buchwalter, was elected to serve on the First Circuit for a term starting February 9, 1921.[8] The year after Judge Walters stepped down from the bench, he died. His judicial career included long sessions on the Court of Common Pleas, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Appeals.

ÿansi (Pelym, Vagily, Middle and Lower Lazyvin) went extinct ca. 2000. It had strong Russian and Komi influences. Long vowels were diphthongized. Eastern Mansi (Kondin) is spoken by 100200 people. It has Khanty and Tatar influence. There is vowel harmony, and for *// it has [], frequently diphthongized. Southern Mansi (Tavdin) went extinct ca. 1900. It had vowel harmony and a strong Tatar influence and displayed several archaisms such as retention of /y/ (elsewhere merged with *//), /ts/ (elsewhere deaffricated to /s/), and /a/ (elsewhere raised to /o/). The first publication of the written Mansi language was a translation of the Gospel of Matthew published in London in 1868. In 1932 a version of Latin alphabet was introduced with little success. The former Latin alphabet: In 1937, Cyrillic replaced the Latin. Mansi is an agglutinating, SOV language.[2] There are two articles in Mansi: definite  (a), which also means "now" when placed before verbs, and indefinite  (ak), literally "one".[3] There is no grammatical gender. Mansi distinguishes between singular, dual and plural number. Six grammatical cases exist. Possession is expressed using possessive suffixes, for example -, which means "my". Example with:  /put/ (cauldron) Missing cases can be expressed using postpositions, such as  (alnl, 'of, out of'),  (sait, 'after, behind'), etc. Mansi conjugation has three persons, three numbers, two tenses, and four moods. Active and passive voices exist. Intransitive and transitive conjugations are distinguished. This means that there are two possible ways of conjugating a verb. When the speaker conjugates in intransitive, the sentence has no concrete object (in this case, the object is nothing or something like something, anything). In the transitive conjugation, there is a concrete object. This feature also exists in the other Ugric languages. Mansi uses suffixes to express the tense. The tense suffix precedes the personal suffix. The language has no future tense; the future is expressed in other ways. There are four moods: indicative, conditional, imperative and precative. Indicative mood has no suffix. Imperative mood exists only in the second person. The suffixes are the following: Thus, the conjugation of the verb  (lat. mina [go]), in past tense (remember the suffix -): Verbs have active and passive voice. Active voice has no suffix; the suffix to express the passive is --. Verbal prefixes are used to modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways. For example, with the prefix - (el-) (away, off) the verb  (mina) (go) becomes  (elmina), which means to go away. This is surprisingly close to the Hungarian equivalents: el- (away) and menni (to go), where elmenni is to go away l(a)  'forwards, onwards, away' ot  'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity' Numbers 1 and 2 also have attributive forms:  (1) and  (2); compare with Hungarian kt, and Old Hungarian "kit").    .

ÿr above the average. His success in rearing a large family to honorable and useful lives, is evidence of many good qualities and ability as a parent. His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession.

ÿansi (Pelym, Vagily, Middle and Lower Lazyvin) went extinct ca. 2000. It had strong Russian and Komi influences. Long vowels were diphthongized. Eastern Mansi (Kondin) is spoken by 100200 people. It has Khanty and Tatar influence. There is vowel harmony, and for *// it has [], frequently diphthongized. Southern Mansi (Tavdin) went extinct ca. 1900. It had vowel harmony and a strong Tatar influence and displayed several archaisms such as retention of /y/ (elsewhere merged with *//), /ts/ (elsewhere deaffricated to /s/), and /a/ (elsewhere raised to /o/). The first publication of the written Mansi language was a translation of the Gospel of Matthew published in London in 1868. In 1932 a version of Latin alphabet was introduced with little success. The former Latin alphabet: In 1937, Cyrillic replaced the Latin. Mansi is an agglutinating, SOV language.[2] There are two articles in Mansi: definite  (a), which also means "now" when placed before verbs, and indefinite  (ak), literally "one".[3] There is no grammatical gender. Mansi distinguishes between singular, dual and plural number. Six grammatical cases exist. Possession is expressed using possessive suffixes, for example -, which means "my". Example with:  /put/ (cauldron) Missing cases can be expressed using postpositions, such as  (alnl, 'of, out of'),  (sait, 'after, behind'), etc. Mansi conjugation has three persons, three numbers, two tenses, and four moods. Active and passive voices exist. Intransitive and transitive conjugations are distinguished. This means that there are two possible ways of conjugating a verb. When the speaker conjugates in intransitive, the sentence has no concrete object (in this case, the object is nothing or something like something, anything). In the transitive conjugation, there is a concrete object. This feature also exists in the other Ugric languages. Mansi uses suffixes to express the tense. The tense suffix precedes the personal suffix. The language has no future tense; the future is expressed in other ways. There are four moods: indicative, conditional, imperative and precative. Indicative mood has no suffix. Imperative mood exists only in the second person. The suffixes are the following: Thus, the conjugation of the verb  (lat. mina [go]), in past tense (remember the suffix -): Verbs have active and passive voice. Active voice has no suffix; the suffix to express the passive is --. Verbal prefixes are used to modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways. For example, with the prefix - (el-) (away, off) the verb  (mina) (go) becomes  (elmina), which means to go away. This is surprisingly close to the Hungarian equivalents: el- (away) and menni (to go), where elmenni is to go away l(a)  'forwards, onwards, away' ot  'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity' Numbers 1 and 2 also have attributive forms:  (1) and  (2); compare with Hungarian kt, and Old Hungarian "kit").    .

ÿr above the average. His success in rearing a large family to honorable and useful lives, is evidence of many good qualities and ability as a parent. His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard.

The first publication of the written Mansi language was a translation of the Gospel of Matthew published in London in 1868. In 1932 a version of Latin alphabet was introduced with little success. The former Latin alphabet: In 1937, Cyrillic replaced the Latin. Mansi is an agglutinating, SOV language.[2] There are two articles in Mansi: definite  (a), which also means "now" when placed before verbs, and indefinite  (ak), literally "one".[3] There is no grammatical gender. Mansi distinguishes between singular, dual and plural number. Six grammatical cases exist. Possession is expressed using possessive suffixes, for example -, which means "my". Example with:  /put/ (cauldron) Missing cases can be expressed using postpositions, such as  (alnl, 'of, out of'),  (sait, 'after, behind'), etc. Mansi conjugation has three persons, three numbers, two tenses, and four moods. Active and passive voices exist. Intransitive and transitive conjugations are distinguished. This means that there are two possible ways of conjugating a verb. When the speaker conjugates in intransitive, the sentence has no concrete object (in this case, the object is nothing or something like something, anything). In the transitive conjugation, there is a concrete object. This feature also exists in the other Ugric languages. Mansi uses suffixes to express the tense. The tense suffix precedes the personal suffix. The language has no future tense; the future is expressed in other ways. There are four moods: indicative, conditional, imperative and precative. Indicative mood has no suffix. Imperative mood exists only in the second person. The suffixes are the following: Thus, the conjugation of the verb  (lat. mina [go]), in past tense (remember the suffix -): Verbs have active and passive voice. Active voice has no suffix; the suffix to express the passive is --. Verbal prefixes are used to modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways. For example, with the prefix - (el-) (away, off) the verb  (mina) (go) becomes  (elmina), which means to go away. This is surprisingly close to the Hungarian equivalents: el- (away) and menni (to go), where elmenni is to go away l(a)  'forwards, onwards, away' ot  'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity' Numbers 1 and 2 also have attributive forms:  (1) and  (2); compare with Hungarian kt, and Old Hungarian "kit").    .

His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921. At the close of his second term, Robert Z. Buchwalter, son of his fraternity brother, Judge Morris Lyons Buchwalter, was elected to serve on the First Circuit for a term starting February 9, 1921.[8] The year after Judge Walters stepped down from the bench, he died. His judicial career included long sessions on the Court of Common Pleas, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Appeals.

Content:
Ujaku Akita ( , Akita Ujaku?) was the pseudonym of Tokuz Akita ( , Akita Tokuz?) (30 January 1883  12 May 1962), a Japanese author and Esperantist. He is best known for his plays, books, and short stories for children. Born in Kuroishi, Aomori Prefecture, he studied English literature at Waseda University and became interested in socialism. In 1913 he learnt Esperanto from Vasili Eroshenko, as a result of a chance meeting, and soon became a leader of the proletarian Esperanto movement, and a member of the "La Semanto" group in 1921. He visited the USSR in 1927 for the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the revolution. In January 1931 he helped found the national organization, Japana Prolet-Esperantista Unio (JPEU), with about 150 members, and with Akita as president. He translated Eroshenko's writings into Japanese, and wrote a textbook on Esperanto. The rise of militarism in Japan led to difficulties for Akita; in the autumn of 1933 he was detained for several weeks, and forced to write a long statement about his activities.[1] Nevertheless he continued to work, founding a magazine the next year, Teatoro (named after the Esperanto word for theatre), which still exists.[2] He joined the New Cooperative Theatre (Shinky Gekidan) but its activities were limited because it was no longer safe to stage plays with political themes.[3] The JPEU was shut down by the police. After the war he established a performing arts school and was active in other organizations, such as the New Japan Literary Society (Shin Nihon Bungakukai). He died in 1962. A museum in his hometown was opened in 1979.

This is surprisingly close to the Hungarian equivalents: el- (away) and menni (to go), where elmenni is to go away l(a)  'forwards, onwards, away' ot  'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity' Numbers 1 and 2 also have attributive forms:  (1) and  (2); compare with Hungarian kt, and Old Hungarian "kit").    .

ÿr above the average. His success in rearing a large family to honorable and useful lives, is evidence of many good qualities and ability as a parent. His sons were Henry, Nathan, Robinson J., Ebenezer, Wesley, Gideon, Stevenson, Lewis and Andrew, most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men. Nine brothers, possessing better business ability, or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers, or at any other period. They were stalwart men, most of them of commanding presence. As a commentator stated three generations later, Take this family, the Stevenson family, the Beery family, where can you find such large families of stalwart, robust long-lived men? Where can we find such men, even in small families? Are we degenerating?[2] These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters. Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County. When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands, he moved to Wyandot County. He was a good man, a sagacious man. He prospered and made good investments. He died in Upper Sandusky, and left to his heirs an ample estate. Upon the death of his brother Gideon, he took charge of his children and reared them, and at his death they were well remembered. Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date. He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful. His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home. Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist. Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer. Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors. He died at an advanced age. In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A. Griswold county auditor. The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky. Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County, near Nebraska P. O. Like their brothers they were successful in business, accumulated property and lived in good style. They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity. Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man, of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed. One of his sons married a daughter of Rev. John W. White of Lancaster, Ohio, and resided in Upper Sandusky. A son of Lewis Peters, and cousin to Judge Festus Walters, was the Honorable S. R. Peters, of Newton, Kansas, an old Pickaway County boy, born in Walnut township in 1842, seven years before Judge Walters. S.R. Peters was a graduate of Delaware University (Ohio Wesleyan), and served through the war as a member of the Seventy-third regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, mustering out of the service as captain. He went to Kansas following the war, and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career. He was a member of the Kansas State Senate, judge of the Ninth Judicial District, a very trying region to hold court. Judge S.R. Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition. In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty-Eighth United States Congress. In 1890, he declined further congressional honors, preferring to practice his profession. Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton, Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican, published in that city. He also practiced law. Judge Peters' wife was Amelia C. Doan, daughter of Rev. John Doan, and they were married in Circleville in April, 1867. Mrs. Peters was a universal favorite in Washington, D.C. society during their residence in that city. Judge Peters great aunt, Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township. Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville, was their son. He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar.[3] Walters was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, September 30, 1849, the son of Daniel and Mary (Peters) Walters. Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent. Walters' father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket. His death occurred in 1855, when Walters was six years old. Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father, working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year. He remained at home until age sixteen, when he entered the Ohio University at Athens, to prepare for college. After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, studying there until 1868, when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University, from which he was graduated in 1870. Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law. He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers. He was a member, Irving Literary Society. Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872. The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus, Ohio and at once went to Circleville, where he began the practice of his profession. Fresh out of Michigan law, Walter challenged Michigan classmate J.P. Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County, Ohios prosecuting attorney position. He lost.[4] Walters was married December 21, 1876, to Miss May E. Wilkes, of Circleville, and they had seven children. Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s. The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years, and when he entered into a case he gave it time, labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind. Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners, having a strong, logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker, he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar. His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other. His practice was general and extended into the county, state and federal courts. In referring to the professional side of his life, one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters: Great lawyers, like great poets, are born, not made; and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession. His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state. Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population, where greater opportunities present themselves, he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence; but he is still comparatively young, and his light will in time grow brighter. His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law. He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer, is a fluent talker, a logical reasoner, and has quick perceptions and sound judgment. He is clear, accurate, impartial and firm, and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters.[5] Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago.[6] In the fall of 1894 he, at the earnest solicitations of his party friends, accepted the nomination for common-pleas judge of the second subdivision, fifth judicial district, which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him. The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I. N. Abernethy, the Democratic candidate, by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes. The Second Subdivision covered Highland, Fayette. Madison, Ross and Pickaway counties. He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899. Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress, but failed to be nominated. From 1875 through to the end of the century, Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees, and acquired a reputation for being a powerful" stump" speaker. Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J. B. Foraker, and it was well-known that he attended the same school[which?] as Senator Foraker, Judge Bookwater [sic][of Cincinnati],[why use sic outside a quote?] Judge Spence and J. P. Ray [sic][J.A. Rae] at Delaware and at Cornell University. At Cornell, Foraker, Buchwalter, Spence, and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters. All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Walters was also one of the assignees of Q. E. Sears & Company, canners, and was later manager of the estate. He favored a protective tariff and a gold standard. As his fraternity brother Joseph Benson Foraker rose in national politics and was required to spend more time in New York City and Washington, D.C., Judge Festus Walters was Fire Alarm Joes eyes and ears back in the Buckeye state. In 1902, Judge Fetus Walters was elected circuit judge in the Fourth Circuit, for a six year term ending in 1908, without an opposing candidate, the circuit being largely Republican. Judge Festus Walters retired as the Presiding Judge of the federal Judicial District of Ohio in 1903,[7] and finished out his judicial career on the Circuit Court of Ohio, serving on the Fourth Circuit from February 9, 1903 to February 8, 1913 for his first term and, a second term, from February 9, 1913 to February 8, 1921. At the close of his second term, Robert Z. Buchwalter, son of his fraternity brother, Judge Morris Lyons Buchwalter, was elected to serve on the First Circuit for a term starting February 9, 1921.[8] The year after Judge Walters stepped down from the bench, he died. His judicial career included long sessions on the Court of Common Pleas, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Appeals.

Subject: Lactarius subtorminosus 
To: Caleb
Content:
Lactarius subtorminosus is a member of the "milk-cap" genus Lactarius in the order Russulales. Described as new to science by William Chambers Coker in 1918, it is known from North America. The whitish to cream-colored cap reaches 56 cm (2.02.4 in) in diameter and is tomentose, with margins folded inward. The gills are packed closely together, and are cream when mature. Gills that are cut will first turn pink then light brown. The stem is about 1.5cm (0.6in) long and 1.11.5 cm (0.40.6 in) thick, white overall with a few cream dots, and covered with a dense layer of small hairs. When cut or injured, the fruit bodies will ooze a sparse whitish latex with a taste similar to cypress wood. The spores are roughly spherical, warted, and measure 5.86.5 by 6.57m. Lactarius subtorminosus may be distinguised from the similar L.torminosus by its milder latex and smaller spores.[1]

Subject: Sabbath food preparation 
To: Keith
Content:
Sabbath food preparation refers to the preparation and handling of food on Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest, when cooking and the use of fire are prohibited by Jewish law. One of the 39 prohibited activities on the Sabbath is bishul (), or "cooking." However, bishul is not an exact equivalent of "cooking." The Hebrew term bishul as it relates to Shabbat is the "use of heat to alter the quality of an item,"[1] and this applies whether the heat is applied through baking, boiling, frying, roasting and most other types of cooking.[2][3] The prohibition of bishul applies to all types of food and drink, even to foods and drinks which are edible when raw or cold.[4] Kli Rishon A kli rishon ( , "first vessel") is a vessel that was heated directly on a flame or other source of heat. Even when removed from the source of heat, this vessel maintains its status as a kli rishon, and possesses the capacity to enact bishul on any type of food placed within it. This capacity remains until the pot and its contents cool below the temperature of yad soledet bo (  , the degree of heat "from which the hand recoils"). The prohibited activity of bishul is separate and distinct from that of havarah (, "kindling a fire"). Performing bishul with a pre-existing flame is forbidden on Shabbat The prohibition of bishul, however, is not limited to the use of fire as a heat source; it is forbidden to perform bishul with any source of heat, whether it be an actual flame, or an electric stove/range, a hot plate, an urn[5][6] or a microwave oven.[7] Moreover, placing food into a kli rishon may constitute bishul in certain instances. While it is prohibited in most instances to initially heat a food item to the temperature of yad soledet bo, foods that have already been fully cooked may sometimes be reheated. In terms of reheating, a distinction is made between dry foods and liquids. Dry food that has been completely cooked is no longer subject to the prohibition of bishul; this is based on the principle of ain bishul achar bishul (   , "Cooking does not take effect after cooking"). Thus, a completely cooked, dry food item, such as a piece of chicken or potato kugel, may be reheated once it has been fully cooked. However, there is a great dispute as to whether this rule applies to liquids: whereas Rashi,[8] the Rosh[9] and Rabbeinu Yonah[10] agree that this rule does not apply and reheating of liquids is forbidden, Maimonidies,[11] the Rashba and the Ran assert that liquids are in fact no different from solid dry foods. In practice, we are stringent and apply the principle of yeish bishul achar bishul (   , "Cooking does take effect after cooking"). This prohibition of reheating liquids, however, only applies when the liquid has completely cooled. If the liquid has only partially cooled and still retains enough heat to be enjoyed as the warm liquid as it was intended to be,[12] it may be reheated. The problem of preparing hot beverages on Shabbat revolves around the temperature of the water. If the water is hot enough to cook the tea leaves, it would constitute malacha. Pouring straight from an urn (also considered a klei rishon) would cause the cooking of the substance. For a solid substance the outer and concrete layer will definitely be cooked (bishul kdai klipah), which would be malacha. For a liquid there is no concrete layer, and therefore no specific part that is being cooked. Therefore it is ruled that a liquid is not considered cooked if it is not yad soledet bo or 113 degrees Fahrenheit. To bypass this problem we use a kos sheini. Using a Kos sheini is acceptable because when the liquid is poured (Erui kos sheini) some of the heat is transferred into the atmosphere, and therefore the liquid loses some heat. Most people hold that this will not cause enough heat to be emitted and therefore the tea leaves will still be cooked. To lower the temperature of the water further people rule that a klei shlishi must be used. Once again in the pouring process (erui klei sheini) more heat is emitted and therefore most people hold that the tea will not be cooked and it is therefore permissible to make tea with this water.[13]

Of the 2,132 who completed tertiary schooling, 31.4% were Swiss men, 26.9% were Swiss women, 22.2% were non-Swiss men and 19.5% were non-Swiss women.[7] During the 2009-2010 school year there were a total of 3,061 students in the Versoix school system. The education system in the Canton of Geneva allows young children to attend two years of non-obligatory Kindergarten.[20] During that school year, there were 200 children who were in a pre-kindergarten class. The canton's school system provides two years of non-mandatory kindergarten and requires students to attend six years of primary school, with some of the children attending smaller, specialized classes. In Versoix there were 413 students in kindergarten or primary school and 65 students were in the special, smaller classes. The secondary school program consists of three lower, obligatory years of schooling, followed by three to five years of optional, advanced schools. There were 413 lower secondary students who attended school in Versoix. There were 605 upper secondary students from the municipality along with 90 students who were in a professional, non-university track program. An additional 596 students attended a private school.[21] As of 2000[update], there were 1,082 students in Versoix who came from another municipality, while 688 residents attended schools outside the municipality.[19] Versoix is home to the Bibliothque Communale de Versoix library.[22] In Versoix there are four primary public schools:Ami-Argand, Bon Sjour, cole Lachenal and Monfleury. These schools go from Kindergarten to 6th grade. There is one public Middle school, the Collge des Colombires. This school goes from 7th to 9th grade. Students from Versoix, Genthod, Bellevue, Cligny, Chavannes-des-Bois and Crassier go to this school. There are no High Schools in Versoix, so the students have to go to Geneva. There is one private school Collge du Lman. The average annual temperature is 9C (48F) with an average annual rainfall of 930mm (36.6inches).

ÿd activities on the Sabbath is bishul (), or "cooking." However, bishul is not an exact equivalent of "cooking." The Hebrew term bishul as it relates to Shabbat is the "use of heat to alter the quality of an item,"[1] and this applies whether the heat is applied through baking, boiling, frying, roasting and most other types of cooking.[2][3] The prohibition of bishul applies to all types of food and drink, even to foods and drinks which are edible when raw or cold.[4] Kli Rishon A kli rishon ( , "first vessel") is a vessel that was heated directly on a flame or other source of heat. Even when removed from the source of heat, this vessel maintains its status as a kli rishon, and possesses the capacity to enact bishul on any type of food placed within it. This capacity remains until the pot and its contents cool below the temperature of yad soledet bo (  , the degree of heat "from which the hand recoils"). The prohibited activity of bishul is separate and distinct from that of havarah (, "kindling a fire"). Performing bishul with a pre-existing flame is forbidden on Shabbat The prohibition of bishul, however, is not limited to the use of fire as a heat source; it is forbidden to perform bishul with any source of heat, whether it be an actual flame, or an electric stove/range, a hot plate, an urn[5][6] or a microwave oven.[7] Moreover, placing food into a kli rishon may constitute bishul in certain instances. While it is prohibited in most instances to initially heat a food item to the temperature of yad soledet bo, foods that have already been fully cooked may sometimes be reheated. In terms of reheating, a distinction is made between dry foods and liquids. Dry food that has been completely cooked is no longer subject to the prohibition of bishul; this is based on the principle of ain bishul achar bishul (   , "Cooking does not take effect after cooking"). Thus, a completely cooked, dry food item, such as a piece of chicken or potato kugel, may be reheated once it has been fully cooked. However, there is a great dispute as to whether this rule applies to liquids: whereas Rashi,[8] the Rosh[9] and Rabbeinu Yonah[10] agree that this rule does not apply and reheating of liquids is forbidden, Maimonidies,[11] the Rashba and the Ran assert that liquids are in fact no different from solid dry foods. In practice, we are stringent and apply the principle of yeish bishul achar bishul (   , "Cooking does take effect after cooking"). This prohibition of reheating liquids, however, only applies when the liquid has completely cooled. If the liquid has only partially cooled and still retains enough heat to be enjoyed as the warm liquid as it was intended to be,[12] it may be reheated. The problem of preparing hot beverages on Shabbat revolves around the temperature of the water. If the water is hot enough to cook the tea leaves, it would constitute malacha. Pouring straight from an urn (also considered a klei rishon) would cause the cooking of the substance. For a solid substance the outer and concrete layer will definitely be cooked (bishul kdai klipah), which would be malacha. For a liquid there is no concrete layer, and therefore no specific part that is being cooked. Therefore it is ruled that a liquid is not considered cooked if it is not yad soledet bo or 113 degrees Fahrenheit. To bypass this problem we use a kos sheini. Using a Kos sheini is acceptable because when the liquid is poured (Erui kos sheini) some of the heat is transferred into the atmosphere, and therefore the liquid loses some heat. Most people hold that this will not cause enough heat to be emitted and therefore the tea leaves will still be cooked. To lower the temperature of the water further people rule that a klei shlishi must be used. Once again in the pouring process (erui klei sheini) more heat is emitted and therefore most people hold that the tea will not be cooked and it is therefore permissible to make tea with this water.[13]

Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) is a plant conservation charity based in London, England. It is a membership organisation, working with 800 botanic gardens in 118 countries, whose combined work forms the world's largest plant conservation network. Founded in 1987, BGCI is a registered charity in the United Kingdom,[1] and its members include the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, as two of its key supporters. The founder and director from 1987 to 1993 was Professor Vernon H Heywood. He was followed in 1994 by Dr. Peter Wyse Jackson (as Secretary-General) who led BGCI till 2005 when Sara Oldfield succeeded him. BGCI's patron is HRH Prince Charles, Prince of Wales. In 2007 its largely London-based staff numbered 17. Dedicated to plant conservation and environmental education, the charity works to support and promote the activities of its member gardens. Its official stated mission is to "mobilise botanic gardens and engage partners in securing plant diversity for the well-being of people and planet." As a global organisation BGCI has projects in a variety of different countries, with major ongoing projects in Argentina, Japan, China[2] (where half of the wild magnolias are threatened),[3] North America, the Middle East and Russia. Two of its major projects are the creation of on-line searchable databases listing the world's botanic gardens (Garden Search) and plants in cultivation among participating botanic gardens (Plant Search). On 18 January 2008, Botanic Gardens Conservation International (representing botanic gardens in 120 countries) stated that "400 medicinal plants are at risk of extinction, from over-collection and deforestation, threatening the discovery of future cures for disease." These included Yew trees (the bark is used for cancer drugs, paclitaxel); Hoodia (from Namibia, source of weight loss drugs); half of Magnolias (used as Chinese medicine for 5,000 years to fight cancer, dementia and heart disease); and Autumn crocus (for gout). The group also found that 5 billion people benefit from traditional plant-based medicine for health care.[4]

ÿ(BGCI) is a plant conservation charity based in London, England. It is a membership organisation, working with 800 botanic gardens in 118 countries, whose combined work forms the world's largest plant conservation network. Founded in 1987, BGCI is a registered charity in the United Kingdom,[1] and its members include the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, as two of its key supporters. The founder and director from 1987 to 1993 was Professor Vernon H Heywood. He was followed in 1994 by Dr. Peter Wyse Jackson (as Secretary-General) who led BGCI till 2005 when Sara Oldfield succeeded him. BGCI's patron is HRH Prince Charles, Prince of Wales. In 2007 its largely London-based staff numbered 17. Dedicated to plant conservation and environmental education, the charity works to support and promote the activities of its member gardens. Its official stated mission is to "mobilise botanic gardens and engage partners in securing plant diversity for the well-being of people and planet." As a global organisation BGCI has projects in a variety of different countries, with major ongoing projects in Argentina, Japan, China[2] (where half of the wild magnolias are threatened),[3] North America, the Middle East and Russia. Two of its major projects are the creation of on-line searchable databases listing the world's botanic gardens (Garden Search) and plants in cultivation among participating botanic gardens (Plant Search). On 18 January 2008, Botanic Gardens Conservation International (representing botanic gardens in 120 countries) stated that "400 medicinal plants are at risk of extinction, from over-collection and deforestation, threatening the discovery of future cures for disease." These included Yew trees (the bark is used for cancer drugs, paclitaxel); Hoodia (from Namibia, source of weight loss drugs); half of Magnolias (used as Chinese medicine for 5,000 years to fight cancer, dementia and heart disease); and Autumn crocus (for gout). The group also found that 5 billion people benefit from traditional plant-based medicine for health care.[4]

ÿked. However, there is a great dispute as to whether this rule applies to liquids: whereas Rashi,[8] the Rosh[9] and Rabbeinu Yonah[10] agree that this rule does not apply and reheating of liquids is forbidden, Maimonidies,[11] the Rashba and the Ran assert that liquids are in fact no different from solid dry foods. In practice, we are stringent and apply the principle of yeish bishul achar bishul (   , "Cooking does take effect after cooking"). This prohibition of reheating liquids, however, only applies when the liquid has completely cooled. If the liquid has only partially cooled and still retains enough heat to be enjoyed as the warm liquid as it was intended to be,[12] it may be reheated. The problem of preparing hot beverages on Shabbat revolves around the temperature of the water. If the water is hot enough to cook the tea leaves, it would constitute malacha. Pouring straight from an urn (also considered a klei rishon) would cause the cooking of the substance. For a solid substance the outer and concrete layer will definitely be cooked (bishul kdai klipah), which would be malacha. For a liquid there is no concrete layer, and therefore no specific part that is being cooked. Therefore it is ruled that a liquid is not considered cooked if it is not yad soledet bo or 113 degrees Fahrenheit. To bypass this problem we use a kos sheini. Using a Kos sheini is acceptable because when the liquid is poured (Erui kos sheini) some of the heat is transferred into the atmosphere, and therefore the liquid loses some heat. Most people hold that this will not cause enough heat to be emitted and therefore the tea leaves will still be cooked. To lower the temperature of the water further people rule that a klei shlishi must be used. Once again in the pouring process (erui klei sheini) more heat is emitted and therefore most people hold that the tea will not be cooked and it is therefore permissible to make tea with this water.[13]

David Huish (born 23 April 1944) is a Scottish professional golfer, perhaps best known for being the halfway leader of The Open Championship in 1975. Huish (pronounced "hush") was born in North Berwick, Scotland. He married his second wife Diane in 1989 with whom he had a son, Oliver, in 1990. He also has two children from a previous marriage, Susan (b.1967) and Martyn (1969). Huish turned professional in 1959, with his first job being as an assistant at Gullane. He took up his first head professional position at Hamilton Golf Club in 1965. Two years later later returned to his home town to take up the same role at North Berwick Golf Club, where he remained until his retirement in 2009.[1] He was succeeded by his son, Martyn. As a club professional, Huish never followed a full time tournament career. Although he was regarded as a competent tournament player, it was not until The Open Championship in 1975 that he came to the attention of a wider audience. After qualifying for the championship in a seven man play-off, he shot rounds of 67 and 69 at Carnoustie to lead by two strokes over Tom Watson, Peter Oosterhuis and Bernard Gallacher at the halfway mark. However, he fell away over the weekend and ultimately finished 13 shots off the pace, in a tie for 32nd place.[2] His best finish in the Open came the following year at Birkdale, when he tied for 21st place. While Huish never won a top flight tour event, he did win many other tournaments, including the Scottish Uniroyal in 1971, and the Northern Open on four occasions. After turning 50, he joined the European Seniors Tour, where he enjoyed some success, claiming five victories, four of them in play-offs, with the last coming in 2001 when he won, again in a play-off, at the Bad Ragaz PGA Seniors Open in Switzerland. Huish later become a very significant and respected figure on the inside of professional golf, serving as the PGA Captain, a PGA Board Member and Ryder Cup Committee Member, a position he held longer than anyone else. In recognition of his achievements in the game, Huish received the Special Award at the Seniors Tour annual awards dinner in 2004 for services to golf.

ÿ[10] agree that this rule does not apply and reheating of liquids is forbidden, Maimonidies,[11] the Rashba and the Ran assert that liquids are in fact no different from solid dry foods. In practice, we are stringent and apply the principle of yeish bishul achar bishul (   , "Cooking does take effect after cooking"). This prohibition of reheating liquids, however, only applies when the liquid has completely cooled. If the liquid has only partially cooled and still retains enough heat to be enjoyed as the warm liquid as it was intended to be,[12] it may be reheated. The problem of preparing hot beverages on Shabbat revolves around the temperature of the water. If the water is hot enough to cook the tea leaves, it would constitute malacha. Pouring straight from an urn (also considered a klei rishon) would cause the cooking of the substance. For a solid substance the outer and concrete layer will definitely be cooked (bishul kdai klipah), which would be malacha. For a liquid there is no concrete layer, and therefore no specific part that is being cooked. Therefore it is ruled that a liquid is not considered cooked if it is not yad soledet bo or 113 degrees Fahrenheit. To bypass this problem we use a kos sheini. Using a Kos sheini is acceptable because when the liquid is poured (Erui kos sheini) some of the heat is transferred into the atmosphere, and therefore the liquid loses some heat. Most people hold that this will not cause enough heat to be emitted and therefore the tea leaves will still be cooked. To lower the temperature of the water further people rule that a klei shlishi must be used. Once again in the pouring process (erui klei sheini) more heat is emitted and therefore most people hold that the tea will not be cooked and it is therefore permissible to make tea with this water.[13]

Two years later later returned to his home town to take up the same role at North Berwick Golf Club, where he remained until his retirement in 2009.[1] He was succeeded by his son, Martyn. As a club professional, Huish never followed a full time tournament career. Although he was regarded as a competent tournament player, it was not until The Open Championship in 1975 that he came to the attention of a wider audience. After qualifying for the championship in a seven man play-off, he shot rounds of 67 and 69 at Carnoustie to lead by two strokes over Tom Watson, Peter Oosterhuis and Bernard Gallacher at the halfway mark. However, he fell away over the weekend and ultimately finished 13 shots off the pace, in a tie for 32nd place.[2] His best finish in the Open came the following year at Birkdale, when he tied for 21st place. While Huish never won a top flight tour event, he did win many other tournaments, including the Scottish Uniroyal in 1971, and the Northern Open on four occasions. After turning 50, he joined the European Seniors Tour, where he enjoyed some success, claiming five victories, four of them in play-offs, with the last coming in 2001 when he won, again in a play-off, at the Bad Ragaz PGA Seniors Open in Switzerland. Huish later become a very significant and respected figure on the inside of professional golf, serving as the PGA Captain, a PGA Board Member and Ryder Cup Committee Member, a position he held longer than anyone else.

In practice, we are stringent and apply the principle of yeish bishul achar bishul (   , "Cooking does take effect after cooking"). This prohibition of reheating liquids, however, only applies when the liquid has completely cooled. If the liquid has only partially cooled and still retains enough heat to be enjoyed as the warm liquid as it was intended to be,[12] it may be reheated.

After qualifying for the championship in a seven man play-off, he shot rounds of 67 and 69 at Carnoustie to lead by two strokes over Tom Watson, Peter Oosterhuis and Bernard Gallacher at the halfway mark. However, he fell away over the weekend and ultimately finished 13 shots off the pace, in a tie for 32nd place.[2] His best finish in the Open came the following year at Birkdale, when he tied for 21st place. While Huish never won a top flight tour event, he did win many other tournaments, including the Scottish Uniroyal in 1971, and the Northern Open on four occasions. After turning 50, he joined the European Seniors Tour, where he enjoyed some success, claiming five victories, four of them in play-offs, with the last coming in 2001 when he won, again in a play-off, at the Bad Ragaz PGA Seniors Open in Switzerland.

ÿ[10] agree that this rule does not apply and reheating of liquids is forbidden, Maimonidies,[11] the Rashba and the Ran assert that liquids are in fact no different from solid dry foods. In practice, we are stringent and apply the principle of yeish bishul achar bishul (   , "Cooking does take effect after cooking"). This prohibition of reheating liquids, however, only applies when the liquid has completely cooled. If the liquid has only partially cooled and still retains enough heat to be enjoyed as the warm liquid as it was intended to be,[12] it may be reheated. The problem of preparing hot beverages on Shabbat revolves around the temperature of the water. If the water is hot enough to cook the tea leaves, it would constitute malacha. Pouring straight from an urn (also considered a klei rishon) would cause the cooking of the substance. For a solid substance the outer and concrete layer will definitely be cooked (bishul kdai klipah), which would be malacha. For a liquid there is no concrete layer, and therefore no specific part that is being cooked. Therefore it is ruled that a liquid is not considered cooked if it is not yad soledet bo or 113 degrees Fahrenheit. To bypass this problem we use a kos sheini. Using a Kos sheini is acceptable because when the liquid is poured (Erui kos sheini) some of the heat is transferred into the atmosphere, and therefore the liquid loses some heat. Most people hold that this will not cause enough heat to be emitted and therefore the tea leaves will still be cooked. To lower the temperature of the water further people rule that a klei shlishi must be used. Once again in the pouring process (erui klei sheini) more heat is emitted and therefore most people hold that the tea will not be cooked and it is therefore permissible to make tea with this water.[13]

It is a Mediterranean resort, with a large pine forest abutting an 11-km-long white sand beach. Historically an area of fishermen and farmers, Guardamar del Segura is the southernmost point where Valenciano (a dialect of Catalan) is spoken. A Phoenician colony, called Herna by Roman geographer Avienus in his book Ora Maritima was the first settlement near the mouth of Segura river,[1] In Spanish, "guardar" means "safekeeping" and "mar" means "sea", and this is another possible basis for its current name. Guardamar hosts local festivals like Moros i Cristians, L'Encant, and Fogueres de Sant Joan, which commemorate its history. Guardamar is the southernmost Catalan-speaking town, although as of 1991, 41.8% of the town's residents knew how to speak it.[2] The INE (Spanish Census) of 2006 showed that the city had 14,261 residents. By January 2011 this figure had reached 16,863 of which only 10,051 were Spanish. The most prominent nationalities in 2011 were: Carmen Verd is the mayor of the city.

Subject: Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union 
To: Nathaniel
Content:
The Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union, usually known as CICCU, was the first university Christian Union and is the University of Cambridge's most prominent student Christian organisation. It was formed in 1877, but can trace its origins back to the formation of the Jesus Lane Sunday School in 1827 and the Cambridge Prayer Union in 1848. The organisation's stated purpose is "to make Jesus Christ known to students in Cambridge"[1]. Students in many other universities followed Cambridge's lead in forming their own Christian Unions, beginning with OICCU (Oxford) in 1879. Initially CICCU became part of the Student Christian Movement, formed in 1889; however, the two organisations clashed in 1910, and CICCU left the SCM in order to provide a specifically evangelical ministry in the University of Cambridge. Again, OICCU and other Unions followed them in this split, and together they founded the Inter Varsity Fellowship of Evangelical Unions (now UCCF, Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship) in 1928, which spread to Canada in the same year and later to the USA, Australia (Australian Fellowship of Evangelical Students) and New Zealand (Tertiary Students Christian Fellowship). Students who became members of the CICCU are asked to sign the following statement, "I desire in joining this Union to declare my faith in Jesus Christ as my Saviour, my Lord and my God". This was one of the issues in the dispute with the SCM. However, this declaration is not necessary to attend any events, become involved with helping or to attend any of the meetings held. CICCU is led by Christian students from a wide variety of backgrounds, united in a common desire to "make Jesus Christ known to students in Cambridge." Past CICCU members have included Josh Moody, Basil Atkinson, John F. Wenham, John Stott and Vaughan Roberts. The leadership operates on two levels - university wide and within colleges. A committee of eight students, known as the Exec organise CICCU. Two reps in each college lead college events and meetings. There are weekly meetings in almost every college during term time  these include bible study, prayer and praise. The college groups then meet together as a whole for Bible Teaching and prayer each week. The CICCU organises weekly talks, explaining what Christians believe, and discussion groups (Christianity Explored courses). The college groups organise termly events in the colleges where people can come and find out more about Christianity. Every year there is a high publicity main event during which events go on in most of the colleges and there are lunchtime and evening talks. CICCU adopts the doctrinal basis of UCCF, an evangelical Christian organisation with which CICCU is affiliated. The doctrinal basis contains what evangelicals perceive as the biblical foundations of Christianity, including: An organisation such as CICCU which embraces biblical truth as infallible will inevitably be controversial, and its tactics have been called into question as hardline and patronising [2]. Attitudes towards homosexuality have been a particular area of controversy, in particular during their 2004 Promise Week event, in which it was alleged that homosexual relations were equated with bestiality.[3]. CICCU members deny that their organisation is anti-gay, stressing "equality in the sight of God", and point out that they love homosexual and heterosexual friends equally, as does God.[citation needed].

ÿit. To bypass this problem we use a kos sheini. Using a Kos sheini is acceptable because when the liquid is poured (Erui kos sheini) some of the heat is transferred into the atmosphere, and therefore the liquid loses some heat. Most people hold that this will not cause enough heat to be emitted and therefore the tea leaves will still be cooked. To lower the temperature of the water further people rule that a klei shlishi must be used. Once again in the pouring process (erui klei sheini) more heat is emitted and therefore most people hold that the tea will not be cooked and it is therefore permissible to make tea with this water.[13]

This parade is attended by over one hundred thousand people each year and is considered to be the largest parade outside India to celebrate India's independence movement and democratic rule.[citation needed] He served as General Secretary of National Federation of Indian American Associations (199294) and organized many regional and national functions to preserve and enhance Indian cultural heritage in America and promote the causes that strengthen the relationships between two strongest democracies of the world, India and USA. Since then he has frequently acted as a liaison with many elected officials in the region and the White House in Washington, D.C. In civil rights movement,Chopra has fought prejudice and racial discrimination against the Indian, Asian, and American community. In 1987-88 he spear headed the movement in Jersey City in the State of New Jersey and in New York City, New York by organizing community protests. He also participated directly in a debate at Columbia University, with the Chief of Police of New Jersey. He led the delegation to meet the Attorney General in Washington, D.C. and also organized seminars at the Crystal City Inn to fight discrimination where entire EEO Commission was in attendance. In 1989-90 he took an active role in organizing demonstrations in Jackson Heights, New York when Indian merchants and customers became targets of violence. With the assistance of Police Department, Mayor and the Borough Presidents Office the situations were resolved. Chopra founded Jackson Heights Merchants Association (1988), Flushing Merchants Association (1989) which are the business hubs of Indian community in New York City. He worked to improve the neighborhood conditions for merchants, customers and citizenry. Chopra is also the founder/President of Asian American Coalition USA Inc.

This has greatly helped not only Indian community to assimilate in America but also benefited countless[citation needed] causes in mainstream America. Chopra has also represented New York City Mayor and Comptroller and the two county executives on Long Island, New York at over three hundred functions over the past two decades welcoming such visitors as the Prime Minister of India, Federal Ministers, industrialists, ambassadors, consul generals, bishops, movie stars, and other people of significant achievements by presenting them with a key to the city, a flag of Nassau County, a citation or a proclamation to mark various events, achievements and celebrations.

Subject: Anserimimus 
To: Anastasia
Content:
Deuterostomia Anserimimus (play/nsrmams/ AN-sr-i-MY-ms; "goose mimic") is a genus of ornithomimid theropod dinosaur, from the Late Cretaceous Period of what is now Mongolia. It was a lanky, fast-running animal, possibly an omnivore. From what fossils are known, it probably closely resembled other ornithomimids, except for its more powerful forelimbs. Anserimimus was found in the Mongolian aimag, or province, of Bayankhongor during a joint Soviet-Mongolian expedition to the Gobi Desert, in the late 1970s. Mongolian paleontologist Rinchen Barsbold named Anserimimus in 1988, combining the Latin anser meaning 'goose' with the Greek mimos meaning 'mimic'. Anser is the generic name of several species of geese. Although Anserimimus does not specifically resemble a goose, ornithomimosaurs have traditionally been named after different types of birds, such as Struthiomimus ('ostrich mimic'), Gallimimus ('rooster mimic'), and Pelecanimimus ('pelican mimic'). The one named species of Anserimimus is called Anserimimus planinychus. The specific name is derived from the Latin planus meaning 'flat', and the Ancient Greek , onyx, meaning 'claw', in reference to the peculiar flattened claws which characterize the genus.[1] Anserimimus was recovered from the Nemegt Formation of Mongolia. The Nemegt is thought to represent alluvial plains containing meandering rivers. The layer Anserimimus was found, is dating from the early Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous, or about 70 million years ago. There is only a single specimen of Anserimimus, its holotype IGM 100/300. It consists of a rather complete and articulated skeleton lacking the skull and lower jaws. Limited information has been published on the anatomy of Anserimimus, as Barsbold did not describe most of these bones, instead focusing on only those with features that set Anserimimus apart from other ornithomimids. In an unpublished thesis Robert Bronowicz in 2005 gave a detailed description of the species, also referring additional material to it, among which a second partial skeleton, specimen ZPAL MgD-I/65.[2] However, in 2010 Bronowicz concluded this other find, though most closely related to Anserimimus planinychus, probably represented a separate taxon.[3] Anserimimus was a medium-sized ornithomimosaurian. Gregory S. Paul in 2010 estimated its length at three metres, its weight at fifty kilogrammes.[4] The thighbone is 435 millimetres long. There are several key differences between it and related species, though most of these are shared with ZPAL MgD-I/65. The claws on the hand are long, low at the back and rather straight, only slightly curved, with the lower surface nearly flat. The forelimb is long and also built more powerfully than that of other ornithomimids, with large crests on the scapulocoracoid of the shoulder and humerus (upper arm bone), which provided attachment points for large arm muscles like the biceps. The metacarpus of the hand is fused, adding to the strength. The foot is strongly arctometatarsalian, with the third metatarsal excluded from the front surface of the metatarsus over 40% of its upper length. Anserimimus was by Barsbold assigned to the Ornithomimidae, a group of derived Ornithomimosauria. This has been confirmed by modern cladistic analysis. Its closest relative may be Gallimimus from the same formation albeit from a different area (Kobayashi & Lu, 2003; Kobayashi & Barsbold, 2005). Other studies have been unable specifically to determine its relationships or those of any other ornithomimids (Ji et al., 2003; Makovicky et al., 2004). Aside from Gallimimus, other theropods found in the Nemegt Formation include the gigantic Tarbosaurus and Deinocheirus, as well as smaller dromaeosaurids, oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, and birds. Herbivores are represented by the hadrosaurids Barsboldia and Saurolophus, the ankylosaurid Tarchia and several titanosaurian sauropods and pachycephalosaurians. The function of the powerful arm, with its straightened claws, remains unknown. It may indicate a different diet or food-gathering strategy than other ornithomimids, although its diet is difficult to determine, since the animal's skull is unknown. Scientists have long hypothesized that ornithomimids, descended from carnivorous theropod ancestors, were actually omnivores or even herbivores (Osborn, 1916).

Content:
Speechlessness of Sadness, is a volume of Turkish modern poetry by Seyhan Kurt. "Hznn Szyitimleri"(Speechlessness of Sadness) was publishing in 1998.It consists of three parts "Deterritorial,Agnostic and Incognitae". We are given the loneliness,alienation,individualism and rebellion created by modern world.The subject matter gives Kurt's poetry its peculiar quality. As the author casts these subjects into his lines,he uses a sharp and complex style.His stanzas variegate in length and his poetry disturbs and re-forms the routine language.The word combinations strikingly violate the order with outstanding,unexpected images. His free-verse often depends on the cadence or grouping of phrases, and the reading depends on either a slowing down or a speeding up till it reaches an emphasis in the final lines.There is a yearning for a better and meaningful life.He pictures man lost in a universe sometimes conscious of his own position. For Seyhan Kurt,man has made the worst of himself and therefore is helplessly lonely. For his art, we can conclude that "the surface of the world and mankind have lost their privacy." One feels driven into a world which he has no control of.

ÿs recovered from the Nemegt Formation of Mongolia. The Nemegt is thought to represent alluvial plains containing meandering rivers. The layer Anserimimus was found, is dating from the early Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous, or about 70 million years ago. There is only a single specimen of Anserimimus, its holotype IGM 100/300. It consists of a rather complete and articulated skeleton lacking the skull and lower jaws. Limited information has been published on the anatomy of Anserimimus, as Barsbold did not describe most of these bones, instead focusing on only those with features that set Anserimimus apart from other ornithomimids. In an unpublished thesis Robert Bronowicz in 2005 gave a detailed description of the species, also referring additional material to it, among which a second partial skeleton, specimen ZPAL MgD-I/65.[2] However, in 2010 Bronowicz concluded this other find, though most closely related to Anserimimus planinychus, probably represented a separate taxon.[3] Anserimimus was a medium-sized ornithomimosaurian. Gregory S. Paul in 2010 estimated its length at three metres, its weight at fifty kilogrammes.[4] The thighbone is 435 millimetres long. There are several key differences between it and related species, though most of these are shared with ZPAL MgD-I/65. The claws on the hand are long, low at the back and rather straight, only slightly curved, with the lower surface nearly flat. The forelimb is long and also built more powerfully than that of other ornithomimids, with large crests on the scapulocoracoid of the shoulder and humerus (upper arm bone), which provided attachment points for large arm muscles like the biceps. The metacarpus of the hand is fused, adding to the strength. The foot is strongly arctometatarsalian, with the third metatarsal excluded from the front surface of the metatarsus over 40% of its upper length. Anserimimus was by Barsbold assigned to the Ornithomimidae, a group of derived Ornithomimosauria. This has been confirmed by modern cladistic analysis. Its closest relative may be Gallimimus from the same formation albeit from a different area (Kobayashi & Lu, 2003; Kobayashi & Barsbold, 2005). Other studies have been unable specifically to determine its relationships or those of any other ornithomimids (Ji et al., 2003; Makovicky et al., 2004).

James Kelley Washington (born August 21, 1979 in Stephens City, Virginia[1]) is an American football wide receiver for the San Diego Chargers. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the third round of the 2003 NFL Draft. He played college football at Tennessee. Washington has also been a member of the New England Patriots, Baltimore Ravens and Philadelphia Eagles. Washington attended Sherando High School in Stephens City, Virginia and was a letterman in football, basketball, and baseball. In football, he was a two-way starter as a quarterback and defensive back and as a senior he was an All-State selection. He twice led his team to the Virginia Class AA-Division 4 State Championship game, though the Warriors lost both times. He was taken in the 10th round of the June 1997 baseball draft by the Florida Marlins and signed as a shortstop. Washington spent four years in the minors, often rooming with current star pitcher Josh Beckett. Washington spent two seasons at the University of Tennessee. As a 22-year-old freshman in 2001, he caught 70 passes for 1080 yards and seven touchdowns and made the freshman All-American team. Considered a lock to be a first-round pick if he left early, Washington stayed for his sophomore year but was limited to four games due to injuries. After missing the first two games of that 2002 season with a knee sprain, and suffered a concussion Oct. 12 at Georgia that sidelined him for the remainder of the season. He underwent surgery on Nov. 19 to fuse two vertebrae in his neck. He finished his two-year career with 93 catches for 1523 yards and eight touchdowns. He was an Arts and sciences major. He was drafted by Cincinnati in the 3rd round of the 2003 draft. He never got much playing time while in Cincinnati, recording just 893 yards and 9 touchdowns in 4 seasons. In Cincinnati, he was famous for his signature "Squirrel" dance after scoring touchdowns. He was released following the 2006 season. On March 11, 2007, Washington agreed to a five year deal with the New England Patriots, reuniting him with his college teammate and fellow wide receiver Dont Stallworth. The deal, with a $300,000 signing bonus and a $4-million bonus due in the 2008, could be worth as much as $22 million over five years.[2] While Washington had not been used as a wide receiver by the Patriots, he had seen time on special teams, blocking a punt against the New York Jets. On February 29, 2008, Washington was re-signed by the Patriots under a new contract.[3] Washington was released by the Patriots on February 17, 2009. He visited the New York Jets on February 18, and the Buffalo Bills on February 24, continuing the cycle of players between AFC East teams. The Baltimore Ravens invited Kelley Washington to an offseason mini-camp to try-out for the team, competing against fellow veteran, free-agent receivers Jerry Porter and Tab Perry. Washington outperformed Porter and Perry, and on May 14, 2009 Washington agreed to terms on a contract with the Ravens.During 2009, set career highs across the board, with 31 REC, 431 yards, and two TDs. Washington[4] Washington officially signed a one-year contract with Baltimore Ravens on May 19, 2009.[5] Washington was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles on July 31, 2010.[6] Washington was released by the Eagles on September 5, 2010 after failing to make the 53-man roster.[7] The Chargers signed Washington to a short-term contract on November 4, 2010.[8]

Aside from Gallimimus, other theropods found in the Nemegt Formation include the gigantic Tarbosaurus and Deinocheirus, as well as smaller dromaeosaurids, oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, and birds. Herbivores are represented by the hadrosaurids Barsboldia and Saurolophus, the ankylosaurid Tarchia and several titanosaurian sauropods and pachycephalosaurians. The function of the powerful arm, with its straightened claws, remains unknown. It may indicate a different diet or food-gathering strategy than other ornithomimids, although its diet is difficult to determine, since the animal's skull is unknown. Scientists have long hypothesized that ornithomimids, descended from carnivorous theropod ancestors, were actually omnivores or even herbivores (Osborn, 1916).

Subject: Sierra de Cuera 
To: Dennis
Content:
Sierra de Cuera (Asturian: Sierra del Cuera), is a 30 km long mountain chain of the Cantabrian Mountains. The ridge's highest point is Pico Turbina (1315 m). This mountain range is located at 6 km from the sea and runs parallel to the coast. It lies within the Cabrales, Llanes, Peamellera Alta, Peamellera Baja and Ribadedeva municipal terms. The mountains of the Sierra de Cuera were vital to the defence of Asturias during the Spanish Civil War (1936 - 1939) and the key to the Sierra de Cuera was the pass of El Mazuco. Following the fall of Bilbao the troops supporting General Franco's rebellion tried to advance by clearing the Republican defenders from these mountains. In order to do this they planned a pincer movement moving south-west from Llanes and west, along the Ro Cares, from Panes towards Cabrales. On both fronts, however, the rugged terrain and the stiff resistance of the Republican loyalists halted the advance during what became known as the Battle of El Mazuco.[1] These mountains were once one of the last refuges of the Iberian Wolf, unfortunately the last one was killed in 2008.[2]

The function of the powerful arm, with its straightened claws, remains unknown. It may indicate a different diet or food-gathering strategy than other ornithomimids, although its diet is difficult to determine, since the animal's skull is unknown.

The 2008 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Tournament was held from May 10 through May 26, 2008. This was the 38th annual Division I NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament. Sixteen NCAA Division I college men's lacrosse teams met after having played their way through a regular season, and for some, a conference tournament. The first round of the single-elimination tournament was played on May 10 and May 11 at the home field of the top-seeded team. The quarterfinals were held on May 17 and May 18 on two separate neutral fields: the Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland, and Schoellkopf Field in Ithaca, New York. The tournament culminated with the semifinals and finals held on Memorial Day weekend at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. The championship weekend, which included the Division II and Division III championships, was hosted by Harvard University and the Eastern College Athletic Conference.[1][2] The championship was won by Syracuse University, beating Johns Hopkins University 1310, in front of a title game record crowd of 48,970 fans.[3] The Division I NCAA Mens Lacrosse Committee was responsible for selecting the teams that competed in the championship tournament. The qualifying teams, along with the seeding for each team in the tournament, were announced on Sunday, May 4, 2008. Seven conferences received automatic bids to the tournament for its top team. The remaining nine teams were selected as "at large" bids by the committee.[4] Five conferences held a conference tournament championship to award the conferences' bid. Canisius earned an automatic bid by winning the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) championship. This marks the first time that Canisius College has gained entry to the National Championship tournament.[5] Colgate earned an automatic bid by winning its first-ever Patriot League championship.[6] Hofstra earned an automatic bid by winning Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) championship,[7] Notre Dame earned an automatic bid by winning Great Western Lacrosse League (GWLL) championship,[8] and UMBC earned an automatic bid by winning America East Conference championship.[9] Two conferences award their bids based on regular season conference records. Loyola earned an automatic bid by winning the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) championship with a 61 conference record.[10] The Ivy League's automatic bid was awarded to Cornell. Cornell and Brown had identical conference records, but due to a victory by Cornell in head to head competition earlier in the season the tiebreaker was given to Cornell.[11] The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) conference tournament champion was Duke.[12] However, the ACC does not receive an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament because a conference must have at least six members competing (for 2 years) in order to be awarded an automatic bid.[13] The following teams were awarded at-large bids by the NCAA Selection Committee: Duke (ACC), Virginia (ACC), Syracuse (Independent), North Carolina (ACC), Johns Hopkins (Independent), Maryland (ACC), Denver (GWLL), Navy (Patriot), and Ohio State (GWLL).[4] The first round of the 2008 championship tournament saw upsets, an overtime game, and the NCAA career points record broken. Unseeded Ohio State bested #8 Cornell 157. The opening goal of this game was scored by Ohio State goaltender Stefan Schroder, who ran the length of the field to put one past the Big Red netminder.[15] Navy upset #4 seeded North Carolina in Chapel Hill with a final score of 87 on the strong play of the Midshipmen defense and the four goal effort of Tim Paul, who was honored with Nike Player of the Week honors.[16] Notre Dame, who was hosting its first NCAA Tournament game, topped Colgate in a contest that was settled in overtime.[17] In a victory over Loyola, Duke's Matt Danowski broke the NCAA career points record, eclipsing Joe Vasta's mark.[18] Syracuse ended Canisius's first ever appearance in the tournament early with a 2019 battle.[19] Johns Hopkins was led by Paul Rabil's four goals in a 104 win over Hofstra.[20] Virginia's Garrett Billings third goal of the game with 6:50 left in the game sealed the Cavaliers win over UMBC.[21] Maryland beat GWLL's Denver 107.[22] The quarterfinals were held at two separate locations the weekend of May 17 and May 18. On Saturday, 17,017 people attended the quarterfinals at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium.

In the first game of the Final Four doubleheader, Syracuse defeated Virginia 1211 in a double overtime thriller.[29] Virginia commanded the first half of the contest due in part to extra-man opportunities resulting from penalties by Syracuse. In the second quarter, the Cavaliers went on a run of five unanswered goals and entered half-time with a 63 lead, and the game's momentum. The game remained in Virginia's favor through the third quarter, prior to the Orange fourth quarter comeback.[29] Syracuse's Mike Leveille scored five goals, including a goal with 3:00 remaining in the game to send the game into overtime, and the eventual game-winner in the second overtime period to propel the Orange into the Championship game.

While, Syracuse goalkeeper John Galloway settled down in the second half and made a number game saving stops as regulation time expired.[29] Virginia scoring was led by Danny Glading with three goals and one assist, while Garret Billings scored two goals. Ben Rubeor, a Tewaaraton Trophy finalist, was held to one point on an assist.[29] Johns Hopkins defeated Duke 109 in the second game of the Final Four doubleheader. The heavily-favored Duke team, who had beaten the Blue Jays earlier in the season 176, were handed only their second loss of the season.[30] Hopkins controlled the deliberate tempo of the game, and held a 42 lead going into halftime. After scoring first after halftime, Hopkins saw Duke pull even with three goals in 45seconds during the third quarter, including back-to-back goals just 7seconds apart.[30] In fourth quarter, the speed of the game accelerated as Duke began to push offensively.

Content:
Ambilikile Mwasapile is a Tanzanian medicine man who uses a tree known as mugariga to make a juice which he claims can cure any disease. The main illnesses that Mwasapile claims to cure are AIDS, diabetes, stroke, high and low blood pressure. The medicine's efficacy has not been clinically assessed. Mwasapile is a retired Lutheran pastor who lives in Samunge village in Loliondo, near Ngorongoro. Mwasapile had a vision in which God instructed him to make his medicine. His vision was of a tree that provided medicine and that many people would come to be healed. After waking up, he said he met a woman who had AIDS and she told him that she came for medicine. Mwasapile followed his vision and allegedly healed her affliction. The woman told her former boss who had fired her due to sickness. The boss had a sick child suffering from brain damage. Mwasapile allegedly healed the child. As word spread, an average of 4,000 pilgrims perday visited him as of early 2011.[1] The government of Tanzania ordered Mwasapile to stop, but due to public demand the government revised the order and provided Mwasapile with support for sanitation. However, his medicine cannot legally be given by other doctors. Notables who have visited Mwasapile include ministers and members of parliament from Tanzania and Kenya and businessmen. The wife of DRC president Joseph Kabila visited Mwasapile. Due to poor infrastructure, road transport costs roughly 500 times the price of the medicine, which is 500 Tanzania shillings.

Content:
The genus Pelecinus is the only living member of the family Pelecinidae (there are also two fossil genera), and contains only three species restricted to the New World. One species, Pelecinus polyturator, occurs from North through South America, and the others occur in Mexico (Pelecinus thoracicus) and South America (Pelecinus dichrous). The females are glossy wasps, very long (up to 7cm) and the abdomen is extremely attenuated, used to lay eggs directly on scarab larvae buried in the soil. Pelecinus polyturator is a shiny black wasp-like insect, about two inches long. Its abdomen is uniquely long and slender. It parasitizes June beetle larvae (white grubs). P. polyturator is parthenogenic; females do not require fertilization to reproduce. Females are common throughout its range; males are rare in the U.S. and Canada, but more common further south.

Johns Hopkins goaltender Michael Gvozden was up to the task. He recorded 7 of his 17 saves in the fourth quarter, including one as time expired to seal the victory.[30] Hopkins was led by Senior Kevin Huntley who netted four goals in the contest.[30] On Memorial Day, Monday May 26, Syracuse defeated Johns Hopkins in the national championship game 1310 in front of 48,970 fans at Gillette Stadium. This game set the attendance record for the NCAA lacrosse championship game and for any NCAA outdoor championship.[28] This marks the 10th victory in a national championship game for the Syracuse program.[31][32] This is John Desko's, Syracuse's Head coach, fourth championship in his ten-year career at Syracuse.[3] The Orange were led by midfielder Dan Hardy with a team-high three goals, fifth-year Senior face-off specialist Danny Brennan who scored his first career goal, and attackman Mike Leveille, the tournament's Most Outstanding Player honoree and 2008 Tewaaraton Trophy winner, who recorded three points on one goal and two assists.[33] Syracuse goalkeeper John Galloway became the first true freshman goaltender in NCAA history to record 16 wins in one season,[29] and just the fourth to win an NCAA title.[3] Johns Hopkins' Paul Rabil played an outstanding game leading his team with career-high six goals and one assist in the losing effort.[34] In addition, Blue Jay netminder Michael Gvozden made 20 saves, the most saves in a Championship game since Maryland's Brian Dougherty in 1995.[35]

Loyola earned an automatic bid by winning the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) championship with a 61 conference record.[10] The Ivy League's automatic bid was awarded to Cornell. Cornell and Brown had identical conference records, but due to a victory by Cornell in head to head competition earlier in the season the tiebreaker was given to Cornell.[11] The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) conference tournament champion was Duke.[12] However, the ACC does not receive an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament because a conference must have at least six members competing (for 2 years) in order to be awarded an automatic bid.[13] The following teams were awarded at-large bids by the NCAA Selection Committee: Duke (ACC), Virginia (ACC), Syracuse (Independent), North Carolina (ACC), Johns Hopkins (Independent), Maryland (ACC), Denver (GWLL), Navy (Patriot), and Ohio State (GWLL).[4] The first round of the 2008 championship tournament saw upsets, an overtime game, and the NCAA career points record broken. Unseeded Ohio State bested #8 Cornell 157. The opening goal of this game was scored by Ohio State goaltender Stefan Schroder, who ran the length of the field to put one past the Big Red netminder.[15] Navy upset #4 seeded North Carolina in Chapel Hill with a final score of 87 on the strong play of the Midshipmen defense and the four goal effort of Tim Paul, who was honored with Nike Player of the Week honors.[16] Notre Dame, who was hosting its first NCAA Tournament game, topped Colgate in a contest that was settled in overtime.[17] In a victory over Loyola, Duke's Matt Danowski broke the NCAA career points record, eclipsing Joe Vasta's mark.[18] Syracuse ended Canisius's first ever appearance in the tournament early with a 2019 battle.[19] Johns Hopkins was led by Paul Rabil's four goals in a 104 win over Hofstra.[20] Virginia's Garrett Billings third goal of the game with 6:50 left in the game sealed the Cavaliers win over UMBC.[21] Maryland beat GWLL's Denver 107.[22] The quarterfinals were held at two separate locations the weekend of May 17 and May 18. On Saturday, 17,017 people attended the quarterfinals at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. This set an attendance record for most number of people to attend the quarterfinal round of the lacrosse championships.[23] Fans in attendance saw Johns Hopkins defeat Navy 104. Navy was held without a goal for both the second and third quarters.[24] The other game played in Annapolis was Maryland versus Virginia, which went into overtime. Ben Rubeor scored the game winning goal in the extra period to send the Cavaliers to the semifinals.[25] On Sunday, at Cornell's Schoellkopf Field, Syracuse defeated Notre Dame 119 on the play of midfielder Dan Hardy who recorded four points, including three goals and the game winning score.[26] Also, Duke routed Ohio State 2110 on the offensive efforts of Zack Greer who recorded a career-high eleven points on six goals and five assists.[27] On Saturday, May 24, 48,224 fans were spectators for the 2008 Division I Final Four doubleheader held at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.[28] The first game featured Syracuse versus Virginia, and the second was a rematch of last year's championship game between Johns Hopkins and Duke. In the first game of the Final Four doubleheader, Syracuse defeated Virginia 1211 in a double overtime thriller.[29] Virginia commanded the first half of the contest due in part to extra-man opportunities resulting from penalties by Syracuse. In the second quarter, the Cavaliers went on a run of five unanswered goals and entered half-time with a 63 lead, and the game's momentum. The game remained in Virginia's favor through the third quarter, prior to the Orange fourth quarter comeback.[29] Syracuse's Mike Leveille scored five goals, including a goal with 3:00 remaining in the game to send the game into overtime, and the eventual game-winner in the second overtime period to propel the Orange into the Championship game. Syracuse's come-from-behind victory included scoring six of the final eight goals of the contest.[29] Syracuse's Junior midfielder Matt Abbott, known more for his groundball and clearing game, tallied three goals in the second half for his first career hat trick to spark to second half rally. Extra possessions earned by face-off specialist Danny Brennan, including both opportunities in the overtime periods and 70% total for the game, helped the Orange stage the comeback. While, Syracuse goalkeeper John Galloway settled down in the second half and made a number game saving stops as regulation time expired.[29] Virginia scoring was led by Danny Glading with three goals and one assist, while Garret Billings scored two goals. Ben Rubeor, a Tewaaraton Trophy finalist, was held to one point on an assist.[29] Johns Hopkins defeated Duke 109 in the second game of the Final Four doubleheader.
