# Data Structure and Algorithm Spring 2020 Final Project

## Discription
The main theme of the final project is a email searcher. The email searcher helps retrieving precious
emails from the mail pool, which contains mails that came in a streaming manner. Of course, we expect
the searcher to effectively use the computational and storage resources of your computer. So the data
structure (and the associated algorithm) used for representing the mail pool can be crucial.

## Spec 
The regulation and discription is written detailed in the spec (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/course/dsa20spring/project/)

Let's hope it still stands.
